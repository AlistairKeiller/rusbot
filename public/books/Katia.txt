The weather had been cold, and so windy that the snow was\noften piled high above our windows; the panes were almost always cloudy\nwith a coating of ice; and throughout the whole season we were shut in,\nrarely finding it possible to go out of the house.\n\nIt was very seldom that any one came to see us, and our few visitors\nbrought neither joy nor cheerfulness to our house. They all had mournful\nfaces, spoke low, as if they were afraid of waking some one, were\ncareful not to laugh, sighed and often shed tears when they looked at\nme, and above all at the sight of my poor Sonia in her little black\nfrock. Everything in the house still savored of death; the affliction,\nthe horror of the last agony yet reigned in the air. Mamma\'s chamber was\nshut up, and I felt a painful dread and yet an irresistible longing to\npeep furtively into the chill, desolate place as I passed it every night\non my way to bed.\n\nI was at this time seventeen years old, and the very year of her death\nMamma had intended to remove to the city, in order to introduce me into\nsociety. The loss of my mother had been a great sorrow to me; but I must\nconfess that to this grief had been added another, that of seeing\nmyself--young, beautiful as I heard from every one that I\nwas,--condemned to vegetate during a second winter in the country, in a\nbarren solitude. Even before the end of this winter, the feeling of\nregret, of isolation, and, to speak plainly, of ennui, had so gained\nupon me that I scarcely ever left my own room, never opened my piano,\nand never even took a book in my hand. If Macha urged me to occupy\nmyself with something I would reply: "I do not wish to, I cannot," and\nfar down in my soul a voice kept asking: "What is the use? Why \'do\nsomething\'--no matter what--when the best of my life is wearing away so\nin pure loss? Why?" And to this "Why?" I had no answer except tears.\n\nI was told that I was growing thin and losing my beauty, but this gave\nme not the slightest concern. Why, and for whom, should I take interest\nin it? It seemed to me that my entire life was to drift slowly away in\nthis desert, borne down by this hopeless suffering, from which, given up\nto my own resources alone, I had no longer the strength, nor even the\nwish, to set myself free.\n\nTowards the end of the winter Macha became seriously uneasy about me,\nand determined come what might to take me abroad. But for this, money\nwas essential, and as yet we knew little of our resources beyond the\nfact that we were to succeed to our mother\'s inheritance; however, we\nwere in daily expectation of a visit from our guardian, who was to\nexamine the condition of our affairs.\n\nHe came at last, late in March.\n\n"Thank Heaven!" said Macha to me one day, when I was wandering like a\nshadow from one corner to another, perfectly idle, without a thought in\nmy head or a wish in my heart: "Sergius Mikailovitch has sent word that\nhe will be here before dinner.--You must rouse yourself, my little\nKatia," she added; "what will he think of you? He loves you both so\nmuch!"\n\nSergius Mikailovitch was our nearest neighbor, and though much his\njunior had been the friend of our dead father. Besides the pleasant\nchange which his arrival might cause in our life, by making it possible\nfor us to leave the country, I had been too much accustomed, from my\nchildhood, to love and respect him, for Macha not to divine while\nurging me to rouse myself, that still another change might be worked and\nthat, of all my acquaintances, he was the one before whom I would be\nmost unwilling to appear in an unfavorable light. Not only did I feel\nthe old attachment for Sergius Mikailovitch which was shared by every\none in the house, from Sonia, who was his god-daughter, down to the\nunder-coachman, but this attachment had derived a peculiar character\nfrom a few words Mamma had once let fall before me. She had said that he\nwas just the husband that she would have wished for me. At the moment\nsuch an idea had appeared to me very extraordinary and even somewhat\ndisagreeable; the hero of my imagination was totally different. My own\nhero was to be slender, delicate, pale, and melancholy. Sergius\nMikailovitch, on the contrary, was no longer young, he was tall and\nlarge, full of vigor, and, so far as I could judge, had an extremely\npleasant temper; nevertheless my mother\'s remark had made a strong\nimpression on my imagination. This had happened six years before, when\nI was only eleven, when he still said "_thou_" to me, played with me,\nand gave me the name of _La petite violette_, yet ever since that day I\nhad always felt some secret misgivings whenever I had asked myself the\nquestion what I should do if he should suddenly take a fancy to marry\nme?\n\nA little before dinner, to which Macha had added a dish of spinach and a\nsweet _entre mets_ Sergius Mikailovitch arrived. I was looking out of\nthe window when his light sledge approached, and as he turned the corner\nof the house I hastily drew back into the drawing-room, not wishing to\nlet him see that I had been watching for him the least in the world. But\nupon hearing sounds in the ante-chamber, his strong voice, and Macha\'s\nfootsteps, I lost patience and went myself to meet him. He was holding\nMacha\'s hand, and talking to her in a raised voice, smiling. When he\nperceived me, he stopped and looked at me for some moments without\nsaluting me; it embarrassed me a good deal, and I felt myself blush.\n\n"Ah! is it possible that this is you, Katia?" he said in his frank,\ndecided tone, disengaging his hand and approaching me.\n\n"Can people change so! How you have grown! Yesterday a violet! To-day\nthe full rose!"\n\nHis large hand clasped mine, pressing it so cordially, so strongly, that\nhe almost hurt me. I had thought he might kiss me, and bent a little\ntowards him; but he only caught it a second time, and looked me straight\nin the eyes with his bright, steady glance.\n\nI had not seen him for six years. He was much changed, older, browner,\nand his whiskers, which he had allowed to grow, were not particularly\nbecoming to him; but he had the same simple manners, the same open,\nhonest face, with its marked features, eyes sparkling with intelligence,\nand smile as sweet as a child\'s.\n\nAt the end of five minutes he was no longer on the footing of a mere\nvisitor, but on that of an intimate guest with us all, and even the\nservants manifested their joy at his arrival, by the eager zeal with\nwhich they served him.\n\nHe did not act at all like a neighbor who, coming to a house for the\nfirst time after the mother\'s death, thinks it necessary to bring with\nhim a solemn countenance; on the contrary, he was gay, talkative, and\ndid not say a single word about Mamma, so that I began to think this\nindifference on the part of a man standing in such near relation to us\nvery strange, and rather unseemly. But I soon saw that it was far from\nbeing indifference, and read in his intention a considerateness for\nwhich I could not help being grateful.\n\nIn the evening Macha gave us tea in the drawing-room where it had been\nusually served during Mamma\'s lifetime. Sonia and I sat near her;\nGregory found one of Papa\'s old pipes, and brought it to our guardian,\nwho began to pace up and down the room according to his old fashion.\n\n"What terrible changes in this house, when one thinks of it!" said he,\nstopping suddenly.\n\n"Yes," replied Macha with a sigh; and replacing the top of the samovar,\nshe looked up at Sergius Mikailovitch, almost ready to burst into\ntears.\n\n"No doubt you remember your father?" he asked me.\n\n"A little."\n\n"How fortunate it would be for you, now, to have him still!" he observed\nslowly, with a thoughtful air, casting a vague glance into vacancy over\nmy head. And he added more slowly still:\n\n"I loved your father very much...."\n\nI thought I detected a new brightness in his eyes at this moment.\n\n"And now God has taken away our mother also!" exclaimed Macha. Dropping\nher napkin on the tea-tray, she pulled out her handkerchief and began to\ncry.\n\n"Yes, there have been terrible changes in this house!"\n\nHe turned away as he spoke.\n\nThen, a moment after: "Katia Alexandrovna," he said, in a louder voice,\n"play me something!"\n\nI liked the tone of frank, friendly authority with which he made this\nrequest; I rose and went to him.\n\n"Here, play me this," said he, opening my Beethoven at the adagio of the\nsonata, _Quasi una fantasia_. "Let us see how you play," he continued,\ntaking his cup of tea to drink in a corner of the room.\n\nI know not why, but I felt it would be impossible either to refuse or to\nput forward a plea of playing badly; on the contrary, I submissively sat\ndown at the piano and began to play as well as I could, although I was\nafraid of his criticism, knowing his excellent taste in music.\n\nIn the tone of this _adagio_ there was a prevalent sentiment which by\nassociation carried me away to the conversation before tea, and, guided\nby this impression, I played tolerably well, it seemed. But he would not\nlet me play the _scherzo_.\n\n"No, you will not play it well," said he, coming to me, "stop with that\nfirst movement,--which has not been bad! I see that you comprehend\nmusic."\n\nThis praise, certainly moderate enough, delighted me so that I felt my\ncolor rise. It was something so new and agreeable to me to have the\nfriend, the _equal_ of my father, speak to me alone, seriously, and no\nlonger as though he were talking to a child as he used to do.\n\nHe talked to me about my father, telling me how they suited each other,\nand what a pleasant life they had led together while I was occupied\nsolely with my playthings and school-books; and what he said revealed my\nfather to me in a light quite new to me, for the first time I seemed to\nknow fully his simple goodness. My guardian questioned me as to what I\nliked, what I read, what I intended doing, and gave me advice. I had no\nlonger beside me the gay talker, delighting in badinage, but a man\nserious, frank, friendly, for whom I felt involuntary respect, while at\nthe same time I was conscious of being in perfect sympathy with him.\nThis consciousness was pleasing to me, nevertheless there was a certain\ntension in conversing with him. Every word I uttered left me timid; I\nwished so much to deserve in my own person the affection which at\npresent I only received because I was my father\'s daughter!\n\nAfter putting Sonia to bed, Macha rejoined us, and began to pour out to\nSergius Mikailovitch her lamentations on the score of my apathy, which\nresulted she complained in my rarely having a single word to say.\n\n"Then she has not told me the most important thing of all," he answered,\nsmiling, and shaking his head at me with an air of reproach.\n\n"What had I to tell?" I replied: "that I was bored?--but that will pass\naway." (And indeed it now seemed to me, not only that my ennui would\npass away, but that it was something already gone by, which could not\nreturn.)\n\n"It is not well not to know how to bear solitude:--is it possible that\nyou are truly a \'grown young lady\'?"\n\n"I believe so!" I answered smiling.\n\n"No, no, or at least a naughty young lady, who only lives to be admired,\nand who, when she finds herself isolated, gives way, and no longer\nenjoys anything; all for show, nothing for herself."\n\n"You have a lovely idea of me, it seems!" I answered, to say something.\n\n"No," he returned, after a moment\'s silence; "it is not in vain that you\nhave that resemblance to your father; _there is something in you_!"\n\nAgain those kind, steadfast eyes exerted their charm over me, filling me\nwith strange emotion.\n\nI noticed for the first time at this moment that the face which to a\ncasual glance seemed so gay, the expression, so peculiarly his own,\nwhere at first one seemed to read only serenity, afterwards revealed\nmore and more clearly, a reserve of deep thought and a shade of sadness.\n\n"You should not feel ennui," he said, "you have music, which you are\nable to understand, books, study; you have before you a whole life, for\nwhich the present is the only moment to prepare yourself, so that\nhereafter you may not have to repine. In a year it will be too late."\n\nHe spoke to me like a father or an uncle, and I understood that he was\nmaking an effort to come to my level. I was a little offended that he\nshould think me so much below him, and on the other hand, it was\ngratifying to feel that he cared to make the effort for my sake.\n\nThe rest of the evening was devoted to a business conversation between\nhim and Macha.\n\n"And now, good-night, my dear Katia," said he, rising, approaching me,\nand taking my hand.\n\n"When shall we see each other again?" asked Macha.\n\n"In the spring," he replied, still holding my hand; "I am now going to\nDanilovka" (our other estate); "I must look into matters there and make\nsome necessary arrangements, then I have to go to Moscow upon business\nof my own, and later--or in the summer--we shall see each other again."\n\n"Why do you go for so long a time?" I asked, dejectedly; for I was\nalready hoping to see him every day, and it was with a sudden sinking of\nmy heart that I thought of again battling with my ennui. Probably my\neyes and voice let this be guessed.\n\n"Come, occupy yourself more; drive away the blues!" he said in a voice\nthat seemed to me too placid and cold. "In the spring I will hold an\nexamination," he added, dropping my hand without looking at me.\n\nWe accompanied him to the ante-chamber, where he hurriedly put on his\npelisse, and again his eyes seemed to avoid mine.\n\n"He is taking very useless trouble!" I said to myself, "can it be\npossible that he thinks he is giving me too great a pleasure by looking\nat me!--An excellent man--Perfectly good.... But that is all."\n\nWe remained awake a long time that night talking, not of him, but of the\nemployment of the ensuing summer, of where and how we should spend the\nwinter. Mighty question, yet why? To me it appeared perfectly simple and\nevident that life was to consist in being happy, and in the future I\ncould imagine nothing but happiness, so suddenly had our sombre old\ndwelling at Pokrovski filled itself with life and light.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nThe spring came. My former ennui had disappeared, and in exchange I felt\nthe dreamy vernal sadness, woven of unknown hopes and unslaked desires.\nBut my life was no longer the existence I had led during the early\nwinter; I occupied myself with Sonia, with music, with studies, and I\noften went into the garden, to spend a long, long, time in wandering\nalone through the shady walks, or in sitting motionless upon some quiet\nbench. God knows what I was thinking, what I was wishing, what I was\nhoping! Sometimes for whole nights, especially if it was moonlight, I\nwould remain kneeling at my window with my elbows on the sill; morning\nwould find me there; and sometimes, without Macha\'s knowing it, I would\nsteal down into the garden again after I was in my simple night-dress,\nand fly through the dew to the little pond; once I even went out into\nthe fields, and spent the rest of the night roaming alone about the\npark.\n\nNow it is difficult for me to recall, still less to comprehend, the\nreveries which at this period filled my imagination. If I can succeed in\nremembering them, I can hardly believe that these reveries were my own,\nso strange were they, so outside of real life.\n\nAt the end of May, Sergius Mikailovitch, as he had promised, returned\nfrom his journey.\n\nThe first time he came to see us was in the evening, when we were not\nexpecting him at all. We were sitting on the terrace, preparing to take\ntea. The garden was in full verdure, and at Pokrovski nightingales had\ntheir homes on all sides in the thick shrubbery. Here and there, large\nclumps of lilacs raised their heads, enamelled with the white or pale\npurple of their opening flowers. The leaves in the birch alleys seemed\ntransparent in the rays of the setting sun. The terrace lay in\nrefreshing shade, and the light evening dew was gathering upon the\ngrass. In the court-yard behind the garden were heard the sounds of\nclosing day, and the lowing of cows returning to their stable; poor\nhalf-witted Nikone came along the path at the foot of the terrace with\nhis huge watering-pot, and soon the torrents of cool water traced in\ndarkening circles over the newly-dug earth of the dahlia beds. Beside us\non the terrace, the shining samovar hissed and sputtered on the white\ncloth, flanked by cream, pancakes, and sweetmeats. Macha, with her plump\nhands, was dipping the cups in hot water like a good housekeeper. As to\nme, with an appetite sharpened by my late bath, I could not wait for\ntea, but was eating a crust of bread soaked in fresh, rich cream. I had\non a linen blouse with loose sleeves, and my damp hair was bound in a\nhandkerchief.\n\nMacha was the first to perceive him.\n\n"Ah! Sergius Mikailovitch!" she cried; "we were just talking about you."\n\nI rose to run in and change my dress; but he met me as I reached the\ndoor.\n\n"Come, Katia, no ceremony in the country," said he, smiling, and looking\nat my head and my handkerchief, "you have no scruples before\nGregory,--I can be Gregory to you."\n\nBut at the same time it darted into my mind that he was not looking at\nme precisely as Gregory would have done, and this embarrassed me.\n\n"I will be back directly," I replied, drawing away from him.\n\n"What is wrong about it?" he exclaimed, following me, "one might take\nyou for a little peasant girl!"\n\n"How strangely he looked at me," I thought, as I hastened up-stairs to\ndress myself. "At last, thank Heaven, here he is, and we shall be\ngayer!" And with a parting glance at the mirror I flew down again, not\neven trying to conceal my eager delight, and reached the terrace, out of\nbreath. He was sitting near the table, talking to Macha about our\nbusiness matters. Noticing me, he gave me a smile, and went on talking.\nOur affairs, he said, were in very satisfactory condition. We had\nnothing to do but to finish our country summer, and then we could go,\neither to St. Petersburg for Sonia\'s education, or abroad.\n\n"That would be very well, if you would come abroad with us," said Macha,\n"but by ourselves we should be like people lost in the woods."\n\n"Ah! would to Heaven I could go around the world with you," was the\nhalf-jesting, half-serious answer.\n\n"Well and good," said I, "let us go around the world then!"\n\nHe smiled and shook his head.\n\n"And my mother? And my business? Come, we will let the tour of the world\nalone, now, and you can tell me how you have passed your time. Can it be\npossible that you have had the blues again?"\n\nWhen I told him that I had been able, without him, to employ myself and\nnot to yield to ennui, and Macha had confirmed the good account, he\npraised me, with the same words and looks of encouragement he would have\nused to a child, and as if he had a perfect right to do so. It seemed to\nme quite natural that I should tell him frankly and minutely everything\nI had done that was right, and also, on the contrary, own to him, as if\nin the confessional, whatever I had done that might deserve his censure.\nThe evening was so beautiful that, when the tea-tray was carried away,\nwe remained upon the terrace, and I found the conversation so\ninteresting that I only gradually became aware that all the sounds from\nthe house were ceasing around us. Upon all sides arose the penetrating\nnight perfume of flowers, the turf was drenched with heavy dew, the\nnightingale in a lilac bush near us was executing his roulades, stopping\nabruptly at the sound of our voices. The starry sky seemed to stoop\nclose above our heads.\n\nWhat warned me that night had come, was the swift, heavy rush of a bat\nbeneath the awning of the terrace, and its blind, terrified circling\naround my white dress. I fell back against the wall, and almost cried\nout, but with another dull swoop it was off again and lost in the\nblackness of the garden.\n\n"How I love your Pokrovski," said Sergius Mikailovitch, interrupting the\nconversation.... "One could linger for a lifetime on this terrace!"\n\n"Well," said Macha, "linger!"\n\n"Ah, yes! linger; but life--does not pause!"\n\n"Why do you not marry?" continued Macha; "you would make an excellent\nhusband!"\n\n"Why?" he repeated, smiling. "People long ago, ceased to count me a\nmarriageable man!"\n\n"What!" replied Macha, "thirty-six years old, and already you pretend to\nbe tired of living?"\n\n"Yes, certainly, and even so tired that I desire nothing but rest. To\nmarry, one must have something else to offer. There, ask Katia," he\nadded, pointing me out with a nod "Girls of her age are the ones for\nmarriage. For us ... our role is to enjoy their happiness."\n\nThere was a secret melancholy, a certain tension in the tone of his\nvoice, which did not escape me. He kept silence a moment; neither Macha\nnor I said anything.\n\n"Imagine now," he resumed, turning towards the table again, "if all at\nonce, by some deplorable accident, I should marry a young girl of\nseventeen, like Katia Alexandrovna! That is a very good example, and I\nam pleased that it applies so well to the point ... there could not be\na better instance."\n\nI began to laugh, but I could not at all understand what pleased him so\nmuch, nor to what it applied so well.\n\n"Come, now, tell me the truth, \'hand on heart,\'" he went on, turning to\nme with a bantering air, "would it not be a great misfortune for you, to\nbind your life to a man already old, who has had his day, and wants\nnothing except to stay just where he is, while you,--Heaven knows where\nyou would not want to run off to, as the fancy took you!"\n\nI felt uncomfortable, and was silent, not knowing very well what to say\nin reply.\n\n"I am not making a proposal for your hand," said he, laughing, "but,\nnow, tell us the truth are you dreaming of such a husband, as you wander\nthrough your alleys in the evening, and would he not be a great\nmisfortune?"\n\n"Not so great a misfortune ..." I began.\n\n"And not so great a boon, either," he finished for me.\n\n"Yes ... but I may be mistaken...."\n\nHe interrupted me again.\n\n"You see?... she is perfectly right.... I like her honesty, and am\ndelighted that we have had this conversation. I will add that--to me--it\nwould have been a supreme misfortune!"\n\n"What an original you are! you have not changed in the least!" said\nMacha, leaving the terrace to order supper to be served.\n\nAfter her departure we were silent, and all was still around us. Then\nthe solitary nightingale recommenced, not his abrupt, undecided notes of\nearly evening, but his night song, slow and tranquil, whose thrilling\ncadence filled the garden; and from far down the ravine came for the\nfirst time a response from another nightingale. The one near us was mute\nfor a moment, listening, then burst out anew in a rapture of song,\nlouder and clearer than before. Their voices resounded, calm and\nsupreme, amid that world of night which is their own and which we\ninhabit as aliens. The gardener went by, on his way to his bed in the\norange-house, we heard his heavy boots on the path as he went farther\nand farther from us. Some one in the direction of the mountain blew two\nshrill, quick notes on a whistle, then all was still once more. Scarcely\na leaf was heard to move; yet all at once the awning of the terrace\npuffed out slowly, stirred by a breath of air, and a more penetrating\nperfume stole up to us from below. The silence embarrassed me, but I did\nnot know what to say. I looked at him. His eyes, bright in the darkness,\nwere fixed upon me.\n\n"It is good to live in this world!" he murmured.\n\nI know not why, but at the words I sighed.\n\n"Well?" he questioned.\n\n"Yes, it is good to live in this world!" I repeated.\n\nAgain the silence fell upon us, and again I felt ill at ease. I could\nnot get it out of my head that I had hurt him, by agreeing with him that\nhe was old; I would have liked to console him, but did not know how to\nset about it.\n\n"But good-bye!" he said, rising, "my mother expects me to supper. I\nhave hardly seen her to-day."\n\n"I would have liked to play you my new sonata."\n\n"Another time," he replied coldly, at least so it seemed to me; then,\nmoving off a step, he said with a careless gesture: "Good-bye!"\n\nI was more than ever convinced that I had given him pain, and this\ndistressed me. Macha and I went with him, as far as the porch, and stood\nthere awhile looking down the road where he had disappeared. When we no\nlonger caught the slightest echo from his horse\'s feet, I began to walk\nabout the terrace and watch the garden, and I remained a long time\nthere, amid the heavy mist that deadened all the sounds of night, busy\nseeing and hearing whatever my fancy chose to make me see and hear.\n\nHe came a second time, a third time, and the little embarrassment caused\nby our strange conversation soon vanished, and never returned.\n\nThroughout the whole summer he came to see us two or three times a week;\nI was so accustomed to him that, when a longer time than usual passed\nwithout his coming, it seemed to me painful to live alone; I was\nsecretly indignant with him, and thought he was behaving badly in thus\ndeserting me. He transformed himself for me, as it were, into a friendly\ncomrade; inducing the most sincere frankness on my part, giving me\nadvice and encouragement, scolding me sometimes, checking me when\nnecessary. But despite these efforts to remain always upon my level, I\nwas conscious that, besides all I knew of him, there existed within him\nan entire world, to which I was a stranger, and he did not think it was\nnecessary to admit me; and this, more than anything else, tended to keep\nup my feeling of deference, and at the same time to attract me towards\nhim. I knew from Macha and the neighbors that, besides his attentive\ncare of his old mother, with whom he lived, besides his agricultural\ninterests, and our guardianship, he had also on hand certain matters\naffecting all the nobles, which caused him much trouble and annoyance;\nbut how he faced this complex situation, what were his thoughts, his\nplans, his hopes, I could never discover from him. If I endeavored to\nlead the conversation to his own affairs, a certain line appeared upon\nhis brow, which seemed to say: "Stop there, if you please; what is that\nto you?" And he would immediately speak of something else. At first this\noffended me, then I grew so accustomed to it that we never talked of\nanything but what concerned me; which I finally came to think quite a\nmatter of course.\n\nAt first, too, I felt some displeasure, (while afterwards, on the\ncontrary, it had a kind of charm,) in seeing the perfect indifference, I\nmight almost say contempt, which he showed for my appearance. Never, by\nword or look, did he give the least idea that he thought me pretty; far\nfrom it, he frowned and began to laugh if any one remarked before him\nthat I was "not bad-looking." He even took pleasure in criticizing the\ndefects in my face, and teasing me about them. The fashionable dresses,\nthe coiffures, with which Macha delighted to adorn me on our holidays,\nonly excited his raillery, which chagrined my good Macha not a little,\nand at first disconcerted me. Macha, who had settled in her own mind\nthat I was pleasing to Sergius Mikailovitch, could not at all comprehend\nwhy he did not prefer that a woman whom he admired should appear at her\nbest. But I soon discovered what was the matter. He wished to believe\nthat I was not coquettish. As soon as I understood this there no longer\nremained a trace of coquetry in my dress, hair, or manner; it was\nreplaced--usual and shallow little trick--by another coquetry, the\nassumption of simplicity, before I had attained the point of really\nbeing artless. I saw that he loved me: whether as a child or woman I had\nnot hitherto asked myself: this love was dear to me, and feeling that he\nconsidered me the best girl in the world, I could not help wishing that\nthe delusion might continue to blind him. And indeed I deceived him\nalmost involuntarily. But in deluding him, I was nevertheless growing\nmore what he thought me. I felt that it would be better and more worthy\nof him to unveil to him the good points of my soul rather than those of\nmy person. My hair, my hands, my face, my carriage, whatever they might\nbe, whether good or bad,--it seemed to me he could appreciate at one\nglance, and that he knew very well that, had I desired to deceive him, I\ncould add nothing at all to my exterior. My soul, on the contrary, he\ndid not know: because he loved it, because just at this time it was in\nfull process of growth and development, and finally because in such a\nmatter it was easy to deceive him, and that I was in fact deceiving him.\nWhat relief I felt in his presence, when once I comprehended all this!\nThe causeless agitation, the need of movement, which in some way\noppressed me, completely disappeared. It seemed to me henceforth that\nwhether opposite or beside me, whether standing or sitting, whether I\nwore my hair dressed high or low, he looked at me always with\nsatisfaction, that he now knew me entirely; and I imagined that he was\nas well pleased with me, as I myself was. I verily believe that if,\ncontrary to his custom, he had suddenly said to me as others did that I\nwas pretty, I should even have been a little sorry. But, on the other\nhand, what joy, what serenity, I felt in the depth of my soul, if, upon\nthe occasion of my expressing some thought or letting fall a few words,\nhe looked at me attentively and said in a moved tone which he strove to\nrender light and jesting:\n\n"Yes, yes, there is _something_ in you! You are a good girl, and I ought\nto tell you so."\n\nAnd for what did I receive this recompense which filled my heart with\njoy and pride? Perhaps because I had said that I sympathized with old\nGregory\'s love for his little daughter, perhaps because I had been\naffected to tears while reading a poem or a romance, perhaps for\npreferring Mozart to Schuloff! I was amazed by this new intuition, which\nenabled me to divine what was good and what one ought to like, though as\nyet I had no positive knowledge of either. Most of my past habits and\ntastes were displeasing to him, and a look or an imperceptible movement\nof his eyebrows was enough to make me understand his disapproval of what\nI was about to do; while a certain air of slightly disdainful pity,\nwhich was peculiar to him, would at once make me believe that I no\nlonger liked what had formerly pleased me. If the thought of giving me\nadvice upon any subject, occurred to him, I knew beforehand what he was\ngoing to say to me. He questioned me with a glance, and already this\nglance had drawn from me the thought he wished to ascertain. All my\nthoughts, all my feelings during that time, were not my own; they were\nhis, which suddenly became mine, penetrating and illuminating my life.\nIn a manner insensible to me, I began to see everything with other eyes,\nMacha, my servants, Sonia, as well as myself and my own occupations. The\nbooks which formerly I had read only in order to ward off ennui appeared\nto me all at once one of the greatest charms of life, and for no reason\nexcept that we talked, he and I, of books, that we read them together,\nthat he brought them to me. Hitherto I had considered my work with\nSonia, the lessons I gave her, as a painful obligation, only fulfilled\nfrom a sense of duty; now that he sometimes came to assist at these\nlessons one of my delights was to observe Sonia\'s progress. To learn an\nentire piece of music had always seemed impossible, and now, knowing\nthat he would listen and perhaps applaud it, I thought nothing of going\nover the same passage forty times in succession, poor Macha would end by\nstopping her ears with cotton wool, while I would not consider the\nperformance at all tiresome. The old sonatas spoke out under my fingers\nin a very different and very superior voice. Even Macha, whom I had\nalways known and loved as myself, seemed totally changed. It was only\nnow that I understood that nothing had compelled her to be what she had\nbeen to us, a mother, a friend, a slave to our whims and fancies. I\ncomprehended all the abnegation, all the devotion, of this loving\ncreature, I realized the greatness of my obligations to her, and loved\nher so much the more. He had already taught me to regard our people, our\npeasants, our drorovies,[A] our men and women servants, in a totally\ndifferent light. It is an odd fact, but at seventeen years of age, I was\nliving in the midst of them a far greater stranger to them than to\npeople I had never seen; not once had it crossed my mind that they were\nbeings capable like myself of love, desires, regrets. Our garden, our\nwoods, our fields, which I had known ever since I was born, suddenly\nbecame quite new to me, and I began to admire their loveliness. There\nwas no error in the remark which he so often made, that, in life, there\nwas but one certain happiness: to live for others. This had appeared\nstrange to me, and I had not been able to understand it; but the\nconviction, unknown even to my own mind, was penetrating little by\nlittle into the depths of my heart. In short, he had opened before me a\nnew life, full of present delights, without having in any wise changed\nor added to my old existence, save by developing each of my own\nsensations. From my infancy everything around me had remained buried in\na sort of silence, only awaiting his presence to lift up a voice, speak\nto my soul, and fill it with happiness.\n\nOften, in the course of this summer, I would go up to my chamber, throw\nmyself upon my bed, and there, in place of the old anguish of the\nspring, full of desires and hopes for the future, I would feel myself\nwrapped in another emotion, that of present happiness. I could not\nsleep, I would get up and go and sit on the side of Macha\'s bed, and\ntell her that I was perfectly happy,--which, as I look back upon it\nto-day was perfectly needless; she could see it well enough for herself.\nShe would reply that neither had she anything more to wish for, that she\ntoo was very happy, and would embrace me. I believed her, so entirely\nnatural and necessary did it seem to me for every one to be happy. But\nMacha had her night\'s rest to think of, so, pretending to be angry, she\nwould drive me away from her bed, and drop off to sleep; I, on the\ncontrary, would lie for a long time running over all my reasons for\nbeing gladsome. Sometimes I would rise, and begin my prayers a second\ntime, praying in the fulness of my heart that I might thank God better\nfor all the happiness He had granted me. In my chamber all was peaceful;\nthere was no sound save the long-drawn regular breathing of the\nsleeping Macha, and the ticking of the watch by her side; I would return\nto bed, murmur a few words, cross myself, or kiss the little cross\nhanging at my neck. The doors were locked, the shutters fast over the\nwindows, the buzzing of a fly struggling in a corner came to my ear. I\ncould have wished never to leave this room; desired that morning might\nnever come to dissipate the atmosphere impregnated with my soul, that\nenveloped me. It seemed to me that my dreams, my thoughts, my prayers,\nwere so many animated essences which in this darkness lived with me,\nfluttered about my pillow, hovered above my head. And every thought was\nhis thought, every feeling his feeling. I did not yet know what love\nwas, I thought that it might always be thus--that it might give itself\nand ask nothing in return.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nOne day, during the grain harvest, Macha, Sonia, and I, went into the\ngarden after dinner, to our favorite bench under the shade of the\nlinden-trees at the head of the ravine, whence we could see the fields\nand the woods. For three days Sergius Mikailovitch had not been to see\nus, and we looked for him all the more confidently to-day, as he had\npromised our intendant to visit the harvest fields.\n\nAbout two o\'clock we saw him coming over the rising ground in the middle\nof a rye field. Macha, giving me a smile, ordered a servant to bring out\nsome peaches and cherries, which he was very fond of, then stretched\nherself upon the bench and was soon fast asleep. I broke off a little\nlinden bough, its leaves and bark fresh with young sap, and, while I\nfanned Macha, went on with my reading, not without turning every instant\nto watch the field-path by which he must come to us. Sonia had\nestablished herself on a linden root, and was busy putting up a green\narbor for her dolls.\n\nThe day was very warm, without wind, it seemed as if we were in a\nhot-house; the clouds, lying in a low circle upon the horizon, had\nlooked angry in the morning, and there had been a threat of storm,\nwhich, as was always the case, had excited and agitated me. But since\nmid-day the clouds had dispersed, the sun was free in a clear sky, the\nthunder was only muttering at a single point, rolling slowly through the\ndepths of a heavy cloud which, seeming to unite earth and heaven,\nblended with the dust of the fields, and was furrowed by pale zig-zags\nof distant lightning. It was evident that for us at least there was no\nmore to be dreaded for that day. In the part of the road running behind\nthe garden there was continual sound and motion, now the slow, long\ngrind of a wagon loaded with sheaves, now the quick jolt of the empty\ntelegas[B] as they passed each other, or the rapid steps of the\ndrivers, whose white smocks we could see fluttering as they hurried\nalong. The thick dust neither blew away nor fell, it remained suspended\nabove the hedges, a hazy background for the clear green leaves of the\ngarden trees. Farther off, about the barn, resounded more voices, more\ngrinding wheels; and I could see the yellow sheaves, brought in the\ncarts to the enclosure, being tossed off into the air, and heaped up,\nuntil at length I could distinguish the stacks, rising like oval\nsharp-roofed buildings, and the silhouettes of the peasants swarming\nabout them. Presently, there were new _telegas_ moving in the dusty\nfields, new piles of yellow sheaves, and in the distance the wheels, the\nvoices, the chanted songs.\n\nThe dust and heat invaded everything, except our little favorite nook of\nthe garden. Yet on all sides, in the dust and heat, the blaze of the\nburning sun, the throng of laborers chattered, made merry, and kept in\ncontinual movement. As for me, I looked at Macha, sleeping so sweetly on\nour bench, her face shaded by her cambric handkerchief; the black juicy\ncherries on the plate; our light, dazzlingly clean dresses, the carafe\nof clear water, where the sun\'s rays were playing in a little rainbow;\nand I felt a sense of rare comfort. "What must I do?" thought I;\n"perhaps it is wicked to be so happy? But can we diffuse our happiness\naround us? How, and to whom, can we wholly consecrate\nourselves--ourselves and this very happiness?"\n\nThe sun had disappeared behind the tops of the old birch-trees bordering\nthe path, the dust had subsided; the distances of the landscape stood\nout, clear and luminous, under the slanting rays; the clouds had\ndispersed entirely, long ago; on the other side of the trees I could\nsee, near the barn, the pointed tops rise upon three new stacks of\ngrain, and the peasants descend from them; finally, for the last time\nthat day, the _telegas_ passed rapidly, making the air resound with\ntheir noisy jolts; the women were going homewards, singing, their rakes\non their shoulders, and their binding withes hanging at their girdles;\nand still Sergius Mikailovitch did not come, although long ago I had\nseen him at the foot of the mountain. Suddenly he appeared at the end of\nthe path, from a direction where I had not been looking for him at all,\nfor he had to skirt the ravine to reach it. Raising his hat he came\ntowards me, his face lighted up with sudden joy. At the sight of Macha,\nstill asleep, his eyes twinkled, he bit his lip, and began tip-toeing\nelaborately. I saw at once that he was in one of those fits of causeless\ngayety which I liked so much in him, and which, between ourselves, we\ncalled "_le transport sauvage_." At such times he was like a boy just\nlet out of school, his whole self from head to foot instinct with\ndelight and happiness.\n\n"How do you do, little violet, how goes the day with you? Well?" said\nhe, in a low voice, coming near and pressing my hand.... "And with me?\noh, charmingly, also!" he replied to my similar question, "to-day I am\nreally not over thirteen years old; I would like to ride a\nstick-horse,--I want to climb the trees!"\n\n"_Le transport sauvage!_" I commented, looking into his laughing eyes,\nand feeling this _transport sauvage_ take possession of me also.\n\n"Yes," he murmured, at the same time raising his eyebrows with an\nenquiring glance, and keeping back a smile. "But why are you so furious\nwith our poor Macha Karlovna?"\n\nIn fact I then became conscious that, while I was gazing up at him and\ncontinuing to brandish my linden bough, I had whipped off Macha\'s\nhandkerchief, and was sweeping her face with the leaves. I could not\nhelp laughing.\n\n"And she will say she has not been asleep," I said, whispering, as if\nafraid of waking her; but I did not do it altogether for that,--it was\nso delightful to whisper when I spoke to him!\n\nHe moved his lips in almost dumb show, imitating me, and as if he, on\nhis side, was saying something that no one else must hear. Then, spying\nthe plate of cherries, he pretended to seize it and carry it off by\nstealth, running away towards Sonia, and dropping on the grass under the\nlinden-tree in the midst of her accumulation of dolls. Sonia was about\nto fly into a little rage, but he made peace with her by proposing a\nnew game, the point of which lay in seeing which of the two could devour\nthe most cherries.\n\n"Shall I order some more?" I asked, "or shall we go gather them for\nourselves?"\n\nHe picked up the plate, piled Sonia\'s dolls in it, and we all three\nstarted for the cherry orchard. Sonia, shouting with laughter, trotted\nafter him, tugging at his coat to make him give her back her family. He\ndid so; and turning gravely to me:\n\n"Come, how can you convince me that you are not a violet?" he said,\nstill speaking very low, though there was now no one for him to be\nafraid of waking; "as soon as I came near you, after having been through\nso much dust and heat and fatigue, I seemed to perceive the fragrance of\na violet, not, it is true, that violet with the powerful perfume, but\nthe little early one, you know, which steals out first, still modest, to\nbreathe at once the expiring snow and the springing grass...."\n\n"But, tell me, is the harvest coming on well?" I put in hastily, to\ncover the happy confusion his words caused me.\n\n"Wonderfully! what excellent people these all are,--the more one knows\nthem, the more one loves them."\n\n"Oh, yes!--A little while ago, before you came, I sat watching their\nwork, and it really went to my conscience to see them toiling so\nfaithfully, while I was just idly taking my ease, and...."\n\n"Do not play with these sentiments, Katia," he interrupted, with a\nserious manner, giving me at the same time a caressing glance, "there is\nholy work there. May God guard you from _posing_ in such matters!"\n\n"But it was only to you that I said that!"\n\n"I know it.--Well, and our cherries?"\n\nThe cherry orchard was locked, not a single gardener was to be found (he\nhad sent them all to the harvest fields). Sonia ran off to look for the\nkey; but, without waiting for her return, he climbed up at a corner by\ncatching hold of the meshes of the net, and jumped down inside the\nwall.\n\n"Will you give me the plate?" he asked me, from within.\n\n"No, I want to gather some, myself; I will go get the key, I doubt if\nSonia can find it."\n\nBut at that moment a sudden fancy seized me, to find out what he was\ndoing there, how he looked, in short his demeanor when he supposed no\none could see him. Or rather, honestly, perhaps just then I did not feel\nlike losing sight of him for a single instant. So on my tip-toes,\nthrough the nettles, I made a circuit around the little orchard and\ngained the opposite side, where the enclosure was lower; there, stepping\nup on an empty tub, I found the wall but breast-high, and leaned over. I\nmade a survey of everything within; looked at the crooked old trees, the\nlarge serrated leaves, the black, vertical clusters of juicy fruit; and,\nslipping my head under the net, I could observe Sergius Mikailovitch\nthrough the twisted boughs of an old cherry-tree. He was certainly\nconfident that I had gone, and that no one could see him.\n\nWith bared head and closed eyes he was sitting on the mouldering trunk\nof an old tree, absently rolling between his fingers a bit of\ncherry-gum. All at once, he opened his eyes, and murmured something,\nwith a smile. The word and smile were so little in keeping with what I\nknew of him that I was ashamed of having watched him. It really seemed\nto me that the word was: Katia! "That cannot be!" I said to myself.\n"Dear Katia!" he repeated lower, and still more tenderly. And this time\nI heard the two words distinctly. My heart began to beat so fast, I was\nso filled with joyful emotion, I even felt, as it were, such a kind of\nshock, that I had to hold on to the wall with both hands, to keep myself\nfrom falling, and so betraying myself. He heard my movement, and glanced\nbehind him, startled; then suddenly casting down his eyes he blushed,\nreddening like a child. He made an effort to speak to me, but could not,\nand this failure made his face grow deeper and deeper scarlet. Yet he\nsmiled as he looked at me. I smiled at him too. He looked all alive with\nhappiness; this was no longer, then,--oh, no, this _was_ no longer an\nold uncle lavishing cares and caresses upon me; I had there before my\neyes a man on my own level, loving me and fearing me; a man whom I\nmyself feared, and loved. We did not speak, we only looked at each\nother. But suddenly he bent his brows darkly; smile and glow went out of\nhis eyes simultaneously, and his bearing became again cold and fatherly,\nas if we had been doing something wrong, as if he had regained control\nof himself and was counselling me to do the same.\n\n"Get down from there, you will hurt yourself," said he. "And arrange\nyour hair; you ought to see what you look like!"\n\n"Why does he dissemble so? Why does he wish to wound me?" I thought,\nindignantly. And at the moment came an irresistible desire to move him\nagain, and to try my power over him.\n\n"No, I want to gather some cherries, myself," I said; and grasping a\nneighboring bough with my hands, I swung myself over the wall. He had\nno time to catch me, I dropped to the ground in the middle of the little\nspace.\n\n"What folly is this?" he exclaimed, flushing again, and endeavoring to\nconceal his alarm under a semblance of anger. "You might injure\nyourself! And how are you going to get out?"\n\nHe was much more perturbed than when he first caught sight of me; but\nnow this agitation no longer gladdened me, on the contrary it made me\nafraid. I was attacked by it in my turn; I blushed, moved away, no\nlonger knowing what to say to him, and began to pick cherries very fast,\nwithout having anything to put them in. I reproached myself, I repented,\nI was frightened, it seemed to me that by this step I had ruined myself\nforever in his eyes. We both remained speechless, and the silence\nweighed heavily upon both. Sonia, running back with the key, freed us\nfrom our embarrassing situation. However, we still persistently avoided\nspeaking to each other, both preferring to address little Sonia instead.\nWhen we were again with Macha, (who vowed she had not been asleep, and\nhad heard everything that had gone on,) my calmness returned, while he,\non his side, made another effort to resume his tone of paternal\nkindness. But the effort was not successful, and did not deceive me at\nall. A certain conversation that had taken place two days before still\nlived in my memory.\n\nMacha had announced her opinion that a man loves more easily than a\nwoman, and also more easily expresses his love. She added:\n\n"A man can say that he loves, and a woman cannot."\n\n"Now it seems to me that a man neither ought nor can say that he loves,"\nwas his reply.\n\nI asked him why.\n\n"Because it would always be a lie. What is this discovery that a man\n_loves_? As if he had only to pronounce the word, and there must\nimmediately spring from it something extraordinary, some phenomenon or\nother, exploding all at once! It seems to me that those people who say\nto you solemnly: \'I love you,\' either deceive themselves, or, which is\nworse, deceive others."\n\n"Then you think a woman is to know that she is loved, without being\ntold?" asked Macha.\n\n"That I do not know; every man has his own fashion of speech. But such\nfeelings make themselves understood. When I read a novel, I always try\nto imagine the embarrassed air of Lieutenant Crelski or Alfred, as he\ndeclares: \'Eleonore, I love thee!\' which speech he fancies is going to\nproduce something astounding, all of a sudden,--while in reality it\ncauses nothing at all, neither in her nor in him: features, look,\neverything, remain precisely the same!"\n\nHe spoke jestingly, but I thought I detected an undertone of serious\nmeaning, which might have some reference to me; and Macha never allowed\neven playful aspersions upon her heroes of romance.\n\n"Always paradoxes!" she exclaimed. "Come now, be honest, have you\nyourself never said to a woman that you loved her?"\n\n"Never have I said so, never have I bowed a knee," he replied laughing,\n"and never will I!"\n\n"Yes, he need not tell me that he loves me!" I thought, now vividly\nrecalling this conversation. "He does love me, and I know it. And all\nhis efforts to seem indifferent cannot take away this conviction!"\n\nDuring the whole evening he said very little to me, but in every word,\nin every look and motion, I felt love, and no longer had any doubts. The\nonly thing that vexed and troubled me was that he should still judge it\nnecessary to conceal this feeling, and to feign coldness, when already\nall was so clear, and we might have been so easily and so frankly happy\nalmost beyond the verge of possibility. Then, too, I was tormenting\nmyself as though I had committed a crime, for having jumped down into\nthe cherry orchard to join him, and it seemed as if he must have ceased\nto esteem me, and must feel resentment against me.\n\nAfter tea, I went to the piano, and he followed.\n\n"Play something, Katia, I have not heard you for a long time," he said,\njoining me in the drawing-room.\n\n"I wished ... Sergius Mikailovitch!" And suddenly I looked right into\nhis eyes. "You are not angry with me?"\n\n"Why should I be?"\n\n"Because I did not obey you this afternoon," said I, blushing.\n\nHe understood me, shook his head, and smiled. And this smile said that\nperhaps he would willingly have scolded me a little, but had no longer\nthe strength to do so.\n\n"That is done with, then, isn\'t it? And we are good friends again?" I\nasked, seating myself at the piano.\n\n"I think so, indeed!"\n\nThe large, lofty apartment was lighted, only by the two candles upon the\npiano, and the greater portion of it was in semi-darkness; through the\nopen windows we beheld the luminous stillness of the summer night. The\nmost perfect calm reigned, only broken at intervals by Macha\'s footfall\nin the adjoining room, which was not yet lighted, or by an occasional\nrestless snort or stamp from our visitor\'s horse, which was tied under\none of the casements. Sergius Mikailovitch was seated behind me, so\nthat I could not see him, but in the imperfect darkness of the room, in\nthe soft notes that filled it, in the very depths of my being, I seemed\nto feel his presence. Every look, every movement, though I could not\ndistinguish them, seemed to enter and echo in my heart. I was playing\nMozart\'s Caprice-sonata, which he had brought me, and which I had\nlearned before him and for him. I was not thinking at all of what I\nplayed, but I found that I was playing well and thought he was pleased.\nI shared his enjoyment, and without seeing him, I knew that from his\nplace his eyes were fixed on me. By a quite involuntary movement, while\nmy fingers continued to run over the keys, unconscious of what they were\ndoing, I turned and looked at him; his head stood out in dark relief\nagainst the luminous background of the night. He was sitting with his\nbrow resting on his hand, watching me attentively with sparkling eyes.\nAs mine met them, I smiled, and stopped playing. He smiled also, and\nmade a motion with his head towards my notes, as if reproaching me and\nbegging me to keep on. Just then the moon, midway in her course, soared\nin full splendor from a light cloud, pouring into the room waves of\nsilvery radiance which overcame the feeble gleam of our wax candles, and\nswept in a sea of glory over the inlaid floor. Macha said that what I\nhad done was like nothing at all, that I had stopped at the very\nloveliest part, and that, besides, I had played miserably; he, on the\ncontrary, insisted that I had never succeeded better than this evening,\nand began pacing about restlessly, from the dim drawing-room into the\nhall, from the hall back again into the drawing-room, and every time he\npassed he looked at me and smiled. I smiled too though without any\nreason; I wanted to laugh, so happy was I at what had taken place that\nday, at that moment even. While the door hid him from me for an instant\nI pounced upon Macha and began to kiss her in my pet place on her soft\nthroat under her chin, but when he reappeared I was perfectly grave,\nalthough it was hard work to keep from laughing.\n\n"What has happened to her, to-day?" Macha said.\n\nHe made no answer, but began to tease and make laughing conjectures. He\nknew well enough what had happened to me!\n\n"Just see what a night!" he said presently, from the door of the\ndrawing-room, opening on the garden balcony.\n\nWe went and stood by him, and indeed I never remember such a night. The\nfull moon shone down upon us from above the house with a glory I have\nnever seen in her since; the long shadows of the roof, of the slender\ncolumns and tent-shaped awning of the terrace stretched out in oblique\nforeshortening, over the gravel walk and part of the large oval of turf.\nThe rest lay in brilliant light, glistening with dew-drops turned by the\nmoon\'s rays to liquid silver. A wide path, bordered with flowers, was\ndiagonally cut into at one edge by the shadows of tall dahlias and their\nsupporting stakes, and then ran on, an unbroken band of white light and\ngleaming pebbles until it was lost in the mist of distance. The glass\nroof of the orangery sparkled through the trees, and a soft vapor\nstealing up the sides of the ravine grew denser every moment. The tufts\nof lilac, now partially faded, were pierced through and through by the\nlight; every slender foot-stalk was visible, and the tiny flowers,\nfreshened by the dew, could easily be distinguished from each other. In\nthe paths light and shadow were so blended that one would no longer have\nsaid there were trees and paths, but transparent edifices shaken with\nsoft vibrations. On the right of the house all was obscure, indistinct,\nalmost a horror of darkness. But out of it sprang, more resplendent from\nthe black environment, the fantastic head of a poplar which, by some\nstrange freak, ended abruptly close above the house in an aureole of\nclear light, instead of rising to lose itself in the distant depths of\ndark blue sky.\n\n"Let us go to walk," said I.\n\nMacha consented, but added that I must put on my galoshes.\n\n"It is not necessary," I said; "Sergius Mikailovitch will give me his\narm."\n\nAs if that could keep me from getting my feet wet! But at that moment,\nto each of us three, such absurdity was admissible, and caused no\nastonishment. He had never given me his arm, and now I took it of my own\naccord, and he did not seem surprised. We all three descended to the\nterrace. The whole universe, the sky, the garden, the air we breathed,\nno longer appeared to me what I had always known.\n\nAs I looked ahead of me in the path we were pursuing, I began to fancy\nthat one could not go beyond, that there the possible world ended, and\nthat all there would abide forever in its present loveliness.\n\nHowever, as we went on, this enchanted wall, this barrier built of pure\nbeauty, receded before us and yielded us passage, and I found myself in\nthe midst of familiar objects, garden, trees, paths, dry leaves. These\nwere certainly real paths that we were pursuing, where we crossed\nalternate spaces of light and spheres of darkness, where the dry leaves\nrustled beneath our feet, and the dewy sprays softly touched my cheek as\nwe passed. It was really he, who walked by my side with slow, steady\nsteps and with distant formality, allowed my arm to rest upon his own.\nIt was the real moon, high in the heavens, whose light came down to us\nthrough the motionless branches.\n\nOnce I looked at him. There was only a single linden in the part of the\npath we were then following, and I could see his face clearly. He was so\nhandsome; he looked so happy....\n\nHe was saying: "Are you not afraid?" But the words I heard, were: "I\nlove thee, dear child! I love thee! I love thee!" His look said it, and\nhis arm said it; the light, the shadow, the air, and all things repeated\nit.\n\nWe went through the whole garden, Macha walked near us, taking short\nsteps, and panting a little, she was so tired. She said it was time to\ngo in, and I was so sorry for the poor creature. "Why does not she feel\nlike us?" I thought. "Why is not everybody always young and happy? How\nfull this night is of youth and happiness,--and we too!"\n\nWe returned to the house, but it was a long time before Sergius\nMikailovitch went away. Macha forgot to remind us that it was late; we\ntalked of all sorts of things, perhaps trivial enough, sitting side by\nside without the least suspicion that it was three o\'clock in the\nmorning. The cocks had crowed for the third time, before he went. He\ntook leave of us as usual, not saying anything particular. But I could\nnot doubt that from this day he was mine, and I could no longer lose\nhim. Now that I recognized that I loved him, I told Macha all. She was\ndelighted and touched, but the poor woman got no sleep that night; and\nas for me, after walking a long, long time up and down the terrace, I\nwent to the garden again, seeking to recall every word, every incident,\nas I wandered through the paths where we had so lately passed together.\nI did not go to bed, that night, and, for the first time in my life, I\nsaw the sun rise and knew what the dawn of day is. Never again have I\nseen such a night and such a morning. But I still kept asking myself why\nhe did not tell me frankly that he loved me. "Why," thought I, "does he\ninvent such or such difficulties, why does he consider himself old,\nwhen everything is so simple and so beautiful? Why lose thus a precious\ntime which perhaps will never return? Let him say that he loves, let him\nsay it in words, let him take my hand in his, bend down his head and\nsay: "I love." Let his face flush, and his eyes fall before me, and then\nI will tell him all. Or, rather, I will tell him nothing, I will only\nhold him fast in my arms and let my tears flow. But if I am\nmistaken?--if he does not love me?" This thought suddenly crossed my\nmind.\n\nI was terrified by my own feeling. Heaven knows where it might have led\nme; already the memory of his confusion and my own when I suddenly\ndropped down into the cherry orchard beside him, weighed upon me,\noppressed my heart. The tears filled my eyes, and I began to pray. Then\na thought, a strange thought, came to me, which brought me a great\nquietness, and rekindled my hope. This was, the resolution to commence\nmy devotions, and to choose my birthday as my betrothal day.\n\nHow and why? How could it come to pass? That I knew nothing about,--but\nfrom this moment I believed that it would be so. In the meantime, broad\nday had come, and every one was rising as I returned to my chamber.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\nIt was the _Careme de l\'Assomption_,[C] and consequently no one was\nsurprised at my commencing a season of devotion.\n\nDuring this whole week Sergius Mikailovitch did not once come to see us,\nand far from being surprised, alarmed, or angry with him, I was content,\nand did not expect him before my birthday. Throughout this week I rose\nvery early every day, and while the horses were being harnessed I walked\nin the garden, alone, meditating upon the past, and thinking what I must\ndo in order that the evening should find me satisfied with my day, and\nproud of having committed no faults.\n\nWhen the horses were ready, I entered the droschky, accompanied by Macha\nor a maid-servant, and drove about three versts to church. In entering\nthe church, I never failed to remember that we pray there for all those\n"who enter this place in the fear of God," and I strove to rise to the\nlevel of this thought, above all when my feet first touched the two\ngrass-grown steps of the porch. At this hour there were not usually in\nthe church more than ten or a dozen persons, peasants and drorovies,\npreparing to make their devotions; I returned their salutations with\nmarked humility, and went myself, (which I regarded as an act of\nsuperior merit,) to the drawer where the wax tapers were kept, received\na few from the hand of the old soldier who performed the office of\nstaroste,[D] and placed them before the images. Through the door of the\nsanctuary I could see the altar-cloth Mamma had embroidered, and above\nthe iconstase[E] two angels spangled with stars, which I had considered\nmagnificent when I was a little girl; and a dove surrounded by a gilded\naureole which, at that same period, often used to absorb my attention.\nBehind the choir I caught a glimpse of the embossed fonts near which I\nhad so often held the children of our drorovies, and where I myself had\nreceived baptism. The old priest appeared, wearing a chasuble cut from\ncloth which had been the pall of my father\'s coffin, and he intoned the\nservice in the same voice which, as far back as I could remember, had\nchanted the offices of the Church at our house, at Sonia\'s baptism, at\nmy father\'s funeral service, at my mother\'s burial. In the choir I heard\nthe familiar cracked voice of the precentor; I saw, as I had always seen\nher, a certain old woman, almost bent double, who came to every service,\nleaned her back against the wall, and, holding her faded handkerchief in\nher tightly clasped hands, gazed with eyes full of tears at one of the\nimages in the choir, mumbling I knew not what prayers with her toothless\nmouth. And all these objects, all these beings,--it was not mere\ncuriosity or reminiscence which brought them so near to me; all seemed\nin my eyes great and holy, all were full of profound meaning.\n\nI lent an attentive ear to every word of the prayers I heard read, I\nendeavored to bring my feelings into accord with them, and if I did not\ncomprehend them, I mentally besought God to enlighten me, or substituted\na petition of my own for that which I had not understood. When the\npenitential prayers were read, I recalled my past, and this past of my\ninnocent childhood appeared to me so black in comparison with the state\nof serenity in which my soul was, at this time, that I wept over myself,\nterrified; yet I felt that all was forgiven me, and that even if I had\nhad many more faults to reproach myself with, repentance would only have\nbeen all the sweeter to me.\n\nAt the conclusion of the service, at the moment when the priest\npronounced the words: "May the blessing of the Lord our God be upon\nyou," I seemed to feel within me, instantaneously communicated to all my\nbeing, a sense of even, as it were, physical comfort, as if a current of\nlight and warmth had suddenly poured into my very heart.\n\nWhen the service was over, if the priest approached me to ask if he\nshould come to our house to celebrate vespers, and what hour would suit\nme, I thanked him with emotion for his offer, but told him that I would\ncome myself to the church either on foot or in the carriage.\n\n"So you will yourself take that trouble?" he asked.\n\nI could not answer, for fear of sinning from pride. Unless Macha was\nwith me, I sent the carriage home from the church, and returned on foot,\nalone, saluting humbly all whom I met, seeking occasion to assist them,\nto advise them, to sacrifice myself for them in some way; helping to\nlift a load or carry a child, or stepping aside into the mud to yield a\npassage.\n\nOne evening I heard our intendant, in making his report to Macha, say\nthat a peasant, Simon, had come to beg for some wood to make a coffin\nfor his daughter, and for a silver rouble to pay for the mortuary\nservice, and that his request had been complied with.\n\n"Are they so poor?" I enquired.\n\n"Very poor, my lady; they live without salt,"[F] replied the intendant.\n\nI was distressed, yet, at the same time, in a manner rejoiced to hear\nthis. Making Macha believe that I was going for a walk, I ran upstairs,\ntook all my money (it was very little, but it was all I had,) and,\nhaving made the sign of the cross, hurried off, across the terrace and\ngarden, to Simon\'s cottage in the village. It was at the end of the\nlittle cluster of houses, and, unseen by anyone, I approached the\nwindow, laid the money upon the sill and tapped gently. The door opened,\nsome one came out of the cottage and called to me; but I, cold and\ntrembling with fear like a criminal, ran away home. Macha asked where I\nhad been, what was the matter with me? But I did not even understand\nwhat she was saying, and made no reply.\n\nEverything at this moment appeared to me so small, and of so little\nconsequence! I shut myself up in my chamber, and walked up and down\nthere alone, for a long time, not feeling disposed to do anything, to\nthink anything, and incapable of analyzing my own sensations. I imagined\nthe delight of the whole family, and what they would all say about the\nperson who had placed the money upon their window, and I began to regret\nthat I had not given it to them myself. I wondered what Sergius\nMikailovitch would have said, if he had known what I had done, and I was\ndelighted to think that he never would know it. And I was so seized with\njoy, so filled with a sense of the imperfection in myself and in all,\nyet so inclined to view with gentleness all these others, as well as\nmyself, that the thought of death offered itself to me as a vision of\nbliss. I smiled, I prayed, I wept, and at this instant I suddenly loved\nevery creature in the world, and I loved myself with a strange ardor.\nSearching my prayer-book, I read many passages from the Gospel, and all\nthat I read in this volume became more and more intelligible; the story\nof that divine life, appeared to me more touching and simple, while the\ndepth of feeling and of thought revealed to me, in this reading, became\nmore terrible and impenetrable. And how clear and easy everything\nseemed, when, on laying aside the book, I looked at my life and\nmeditated upon it. It seemed impossible not to live aright, and very\nsimple to love every one and to be loved by every one. Besides, every\none was good and gentle to me, even Sonia, whom I continued to teach,\nand who had become totally different, who really made an effort to\nunderstand, and to satisfy me, and give me no annoyance. What I was\ntrying to be to others, others were to me.\n\nPassing then to my enemies, from whom I must obtain forgiveness before\nthe great day, I could not think of any except one young lady in the\nneighborhood, whom I had laughed at before some company, about a year\nbefore, and who had ceased to visit at our house. I wrote a letter to\nher, acknowledging my fault, and begging her pardon. She responded by\nfully granting it, and asking mine in return. I shed tears of pleasure\nwhile reading these frank lines, which seemed to me full of deep and\ntouching sentiment. My maid wept when I asked her pardon also. Why were\nthey all so good to me? How had I deserved so much affection? I asked\nmyself. Involuntarily I began to think about Sergius Mikailovitch. I\ncould not help it, and besides I did not consider it a light or\nfrivolous diversion. True I was not thinking about him at all as I had\ndone on that night when, for the first time, I found out that I loved\nhim; I was thinking of him just as of myself, linking him, in spite of\nmyself, with every plan and idea of my future. The dominating influence\nwhich his presence had exercised over me, faded away completely in my\nimagination. I felt myself to-day his equal, and, from the summit of the\nideal edifice whence I was looking down, I had full comprehension of\nhim. Whatever in him had previously appeared strange to me was now\nintelligible. To-day, for the first time, I could appreciate the thought\nhe had expressed to me, that happiness consists in living for others,\nand to-day I felt in perfect unison with him. It appeared to me that we\ntwo were to enjoy a calm and illimitable happiness. No thought entered\nmy mind of journeys to foreign lands, guests at home, excitement, stir,\nand gayety; it was to be a peaceful existence, a home life in the\ncountry, perpetual abnegation of one\'s own will, perpetual love for\neach other, perpetual and absolute thankfulness to a loving and helpful\nProvidence.\n\nI concluded my devotions, as I had purposed, upon the anniversary of my\nbirth. My heart was so overflowing with happiness, that day, when I\nreturned from church, that there resulted all kinds of dread of life,\nfear of every feeling, terrors of whatever might disturb this happiness.\nBut we had scarcely descended from the droschky to the steps before the\nhouse, when I heard the well-known sound of his cabriolet upon the\nbridge, and in a moment Sergius Mikailovitch was with us. He offered me\nhis congratulations, and we went into the drawing-room together. Never\nsince I had known him, had I found myself so calm, so independent in his\npresence, as upon this morning. I felt that I bore within myself an\nentire new world, which he did not comprehend and which was superior to\nhim. I did not feel the least agitation in his society. He may, however,\nhave understood what was passing within me, for his gentleness to me was\npeculiarly delicate, almost, as it were, a religious deference. I was\ngoing towards the piano, but he locked it and put the key in his pocket,\nsaying:\n\n"Do not spoil the state of mind I see you are in; there is sounding, at\nthis moment, in the depths of your soul, a music which no harmony of\nthis earth can approach!"\n\nI was grateful to him for this thought, yet, at the same time, it was a\nlittle displeasing to me that he should thus understand, too easily, and\ntoo clearly, what was to remain secret from all, in the kingdom of my\nsoul.\n\nAfter dinner he said that he had come to bring me his congratulations\nand to say farewell, as he was going to Moscow on the following day. He\nwas looking at Macha when he said this, but he gave me a quick\nside-glance as if he was afraid of noticing some emotion upon my\ncountenance. But I showed neither surprise nor agitation, and did not\neven ask if his absence would be long. I knew that he said so, but I\nknew that he was not going. How? I cannot, now, explain it in the least;\nbut on this memorable day it appeared to me that I knew all that had\nbeen, and all that would be. I was in a mood akin to one of those happy\ndreams, where one has a kind of luminous vision of both the future and\nthe past.\n\nHe had intended going immediately after dinner, but Macha had left the\ntable, to take her siesta, and he was obliged to wait until she awoke in\norder to take leave of her.\n\nThe sun was shining full into the drawing-room, and we went out upon the\nterrace. We were scarcely seated, when I entered upon the conversation\nwhich was to decide the fate of my love. I began to speak, neither\nsooner nor later, but at the first moment that found us face to face\nalone, when nothing else had been said, when nothing had stolen into the\ntone and general character of the conversation which might hinder or\nembarrass what I wished to say. I cannot myself comprehend whence came\nthe calmness, the resolution, the precision of my words. One would have\nsaid that it was not I who was talking, and that something--I know not\nwhat--independent of my own volition, was making me speak. He was\nseated opposite to me, and, having drawn down to him a branch of lilac,\nbegan to pluck off its leaves. When I opened my lips, he let go the\nlittle branch, and covered his face with his hand. This might be the\nattitude of a man who was perfectly calm, or that of a man yielding to\ngreat agitation.\n\n"Why are you going away?" I began, in a resolute tone; then stopped, and\nlooked him straight in the eyes.\n\nHe did not reply at once.\n\n"Business!" he articulated, looking down on the ground.\n\nI saw that it was difficult for him to dissemble in answering a question\nI put so frankly.\n\n"Listen," said I, "you know what this day is to me. In many ways it is a\ngreat day. If I question you, it is not only to show my interest in you\n(you know I am used to you, and fond of you), I question you because I\nmust know. Why are you going away?"\n\n"It is excessively difficult to tell you the truth, to tell you why I am\ngoing away. During this week I have thought a great deal of you and of\nmyself, and I have decided that it is necessary for me to go. You\nunderstand ... why? And if you love me, do not question me!"\n\nHe passed his hand across his brow, and, covering his eyes again with\nthe same hand, he added:\n\n"This is painful to me.... But you understand, Katia!"\n\nMy heart began to beat hard in my breast.\n\n"I cannot understand," said I, "_I cannot do it_; but _you_, speak to\nme, in the name of God, in the name of this day, speak to me, I can hear\neverything calmly."\n\nHe changed his attitude, looked at me, and caught the branch of lilac\nagain.\n\n"Well," he resumed, after a moment\'s silence, in a voice which vainly\nstruggled to appear firm, "though it may be absurd, and almost\nimpossible to translate into words, and though it will cost me much, I\nwill try to explain to you;"--and as he uttered the words there were\nlines on his brow, as if he was suffering physical pain.\n\n"Go on," I said.\n\n"You must suppose there is a gentleman,--A. we will call him,--old,\nweary of existence; and a lady,--Madame B. we will say,--young, happy,\nand as yet knowing neither the world nor life. In consequence of family\nrelations A. loved B. like a daughter, with no fear of coming to love\nher differently."\n\nHe was silent, and I did not interrupt him.\n\n"But," he suddenly pursued, in a brief, resolute voice, without looking\nat me, "he had forgotten that B. was young, that for her life was still\nbut a game, that it might easily happen that he might love her, and that\nB. might amuse herself with him. He deceived himself, and one fine day\nhe found that another feeling, weighty to bear as remorse, had stolen\ninto his soul, and he was startled. He dreaded to see their old friendly\nrelations thus compromised, and he decided to go away before these had\ntime to change their nature."\n\nAs he spoke, he again with seeming carelessness passed his hand across\nhis eyes, and covered them.\n\n"And why did he fear to love differently?" I said, presently, in a\nsteady voice, controlling my emotion; but no doubt this seemed to him\nmere playful banter, for he answered with the air of a deeply wounded\nman:\n\n"You are young; I am no longer so. Playing may please you, for me more\nis necessary. Only, do not play with me, for I assure you it will do me\nno good,--and you might find it weigh on your conscience! That is what\nA. said," he added,--"but all this is nonsense; you understand, now, why\nI am going; let us say no more about it, I beg you...."\n\n"Yes, yes, let us speak of it!" said I, and tears made my voice tremble.\n"Did she love him or not?"\n\nHe did not reply.\n\n"And if he did not love her," I continued, "why did he play with her as\nif she were a child?"\n\n"Yes, yes, A. had been culpable," he replied interrupting me; "but all\nthat is over, and they have parted from each other ... good friends!"\n\n"But this is frightful! And is there no other end?" I exclaimed,\nterrified at what I was saying.\n\n"Yes, there is one." And he uncovered his agitated face, and looked at\nme steadily. "There are even two other ends, quite different. But, for\nthe love of God, do not interrupt me, and listen to me quietly. Some\nsay," he went on, rising, and giving a forced, sad smile, "some say that\nA. went mad, that he loved B. with an insane love, and that he told her\nso.... But that she only laughed at him. For her the matter had been but\na jest, a trifle; for him,--the one thing in his life!"\n\nI shivered, and would have broken in, to tell him that he should not\ndare to speak for me; but he stopped me, and, laying his hand upon mine:\n\n"Wait!" he said, in a shaking voice: "others say that she was sorry for\nhim, that she fancied--poor little girl, knowing nothing of the\nworld--that she might actually love him, and that she consented to be\nhis wife. And he--madman--he believed,--believed that all his life was\nbeginning again; but she herself became conscious that she was\ndeceiving him and that he was deceiving her.... Let us talk no more\nabout it!" he concluded, indeed evidently incapable of farther speech,\nand he silently sat down again opposite me.\n\nHe had said, "Let us talk no more about it," but it was manifest that\nwith all the strength of his soul he was waiting for a word from me.\nIndeed I tried to speak, and could not; something stopped my breath. I\nlooked at him, he was pale, and his lower lip was trembling. I was very\nsorry for him. I made another effort, and suddenly succeeding in\nbreaking the silence which paralyzed me. I said, in a slow, concentrated\nvoice, fearing every moment it would fail me:\n\n"There is a third end to the story" (I stopped, but he remained silent),\n"and this other end is that he did not love her, that he hurt her, hurt\nher cruelly, that he believed he was right to do it, that he ... that he\nwent away, and that, moreover, moreover, he was proud of it. It is not\non my side, but on yours, that the trifling has been, from the first day\nI loved you; I loved you," I repeated, and at the word "loved" my voice\ninvoluntarily changed from its tone of slow concentration to a kind of\nwild cry which appalled myself.\n\nHe was standing up before me, very pale, his lip trembled more and more,\nand I saw two heavy tears making their way down his cheeks.\n\n"This is dreadful!"--I could barely get out the words, choked with anger\nand unshed tears.--"And why?..." I jumped up hastily, to run away.\n\nBut he sprang towards me. In a moment his head was upon my knees, my\ntrembling hands were pressed again and again to his lips, and I felt hot\ndrops falling upon them.\n\n"My God, if I had known!" he was murmuring.\n\n"Why? why?" I repeated mechanically, my soul in the grasp of that\ntransport which seizes, possesses, and flies forever, that rapture which\nreturns no more.\n\nFive minutes afterwards, Sonia went dashing upstairs to Macha, and all\nover the house, crying out that Katia was going to marry Sergius\nMikailovitch.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\nThere was no reason to delay our marriage, and neither he nor I desired\nto do so. It is true that Macha longed to go to Moscow to order my\ntrousseau, and Sergius\' mother considered it incumbent upon him before\nmarrying to buy a new carriage and more furniture and have the whole\nhouse renovated, but we both insisted that this could all be done quite\nas well afterwards, and that we would be married at the end of the\nfortnight succeeding my birthday, without trousseau, parade, guests,\ngroomsmen, supper, champagne, or any of the traditional attributes of a\nwedding. He told me that his mother was unwilling to have the great\nevent take place without the music, the avalanche of trunks, the\nrefurnished house, which, at a cost of thirty thousand roubles, had\naccompanied her own marriage; and how, without his knowledge, she had\nransacked for treasures all the chests in the lumber rooms, and held\nsober consultations with Mariouchka, the housekeeper, on the subject of\ncertain new carpets and curtains, quite indispensable to our happiness.\nOn our side, Macha was similarly employed, with my maid Kouzminicha. She\ncould not be laughed out of this; being firmly persuaded that when\nSergius and I ought to have been discussing our future arrangements, we\nwasted our time in soft speeches (as was perhaps natural in our\nposition); while of course, in fact, the very substance of our future\nhappiness was dependent upon the cut and embroidery of my dresses, and\nthe straight hems on our table-cloths and napkins. Between Pokrovski and\nNikolski, every day and several times a day, mysterious communications\nwere exchanged as to the progressing preparations; and though apparently\nMacha and the bridegroom\'s mother were upon the tenderest terms, one\nfelt sure of the constant passage of shafts of keen and hostile\ndiplomacy between the two powers.\n\nTatiana Semenovna, his mother, with whom I now became more fully\nacquainted, was a woman of the old school, starched and stiff, and a\nsevere mistress. Sergius loved her, not only from duty as a son, but\nalso with the sentiment of a man who saw in her the best, the most\nintelligent, the tenderest, and the most amiable woman in the world.\nTatiana had always been cordial and kind to us, particularly to me, and\nshe was delighted that her son should marry; but as soon as I became\nbetrothed to him it appeared to me that she wished to make me feel that\nhe might have made a better match, and that I ought never to forget the\nfact. I perfectly understood her, and was entirely of her opinion.\n\nDuring these last two weeks, Sergius and I saw each other every day; he\nalways dined with us and remained until midnight; but, though he often\ntold me--and I knew he was telling the truth--that he could not now live\nwithout me, yet he never spent the whole day with me, and even, after a\nfashion, continued to attend to his business matters. Our outward\nrelations, up to the very time of our marriage, were exactly what they\nhad been; we still said "_you_" to each other, he did not even kiss my\nhand, and not only did he not seek, but he actually avoided occasions of\nfinding himself alone with me, as if he feared giving himself up too\nmuch to the great and dangerous love he bore in his heart.\n\nAll these days the weather was bad, and we spent most of them in the\ndrawing-room; our conversations being held in the corner between the\npiano and the window.\n\n"Do you know that there is one thing I have been wishing to say to you\nfor a long time?" he said, late one evening, when we were alone in our\ncorner. "I have been thinking of it, all the time you have been at the\npiano."\n\n"Tell me nothing, I know all," I replied.\n\n"Well then, we will say no more about it."\n\n"Oh, yes, indeed, tell me; what is it?" I asked.\n\n"It is this. You remember me telling you that story about A. and B.?"\n\n"As if I could help remembering that foolish story! How lucky that it\nhas ended so...."\n\n"A little more, and I would have destroyed my happiness with my own\nhand; you saved me; but the thing is, that I was not truthful with you,\nthen; it has been on my conscience, and now I wish to tell you all."\n\n"Ah, please do not!"\n\n"Do not be afraid," he said, smiling, "it is only that I must justify\nmyself. When I began to talk to you, I wished to debate the question."\n\n"Why debate?" said I, "that is never necessary."\n\nHe looked at me in silence, then went on.\n\n"In regard to the end of that story,--what I said to you, then, was not\nnonsense; clearly there was something to fear, and I was right to fear\nit. To receive everything from you, and give you so little! You are yet\na child, yet an unexpanded flower, you love for the first time, while\nI...."\n\n"Oh, yes, tell me the truth!" I exclaimed. But all at once I was afraid\nof his answer. "No, do not tell me!" I added.\n\n"Whether I have loved before? is that it?" he said, instantly divining\nmy thought. "It is easy to tell you that. No, I have not loved. Never\nhas such a feeling.... So, do you not see how imperative it was for me\nto reflect, before telling you that I loved you? What am I giving you?\nLove, it is true...."\n\n"Is that so little?" I asked, looking into his face.\n\n"Yes, that is little, my darling, little for you. You have beauty and\nyouth. Often, at night, I cannot sleep for happiness; I am incessantly\nthinking how we are going to live together. I have already lived much,\nyet it seems to me that I have but just now come to the knowledge of\nwhat makes happiness. A sweet, tranquil life, in our retired corner,\nwith the possibility of doing good to those to whom it is so easy to do\nit, and who, nevertheless, are so little used to it; then work,--work,\nwhence, you know, some profit always springs; recreation, also, nature,\nbooks, music, the affection of some congenial friend; there is my\nhappiness, a happiness higher than I ever dreamed of. And beyond all\nthat, a loved one like you, perhaps a family; in one word, all that a\nman can desire in this world!"\n\n"Yes," said I.\n\n"For me, whose youth is done, yes; but for you ..." he continued. "You\nhave not yet lived; perhaps you might have wished to pursue your\nhappiness in some other path, and in some other path perhaps you might\nhave found it. At present it seems to you that what I speak of is indeed\nhappiness, because you love me...."\n\n"No, I have never desired nor liked any but this sweet home life. And\nyou have just said precisely what I think, myself."\n\nHe smiled.\n\n"It seems so to you, my darling. But that is little for you. You have\nbeauty and youth," he repeated, thoughtfully.\n\nI was beginning to feel provoked at seeing that he would not believe me,\nand that in a certain way he was reproaching me with my beauty and my\nyouth.\n\n"Come now, why do you love me?" I asked, rather hotly: "for my youth or\nfor myself?"\n\n"I do not know, but I do love," he replied, fixing upon me an observant\nlook, full of alluring sweetness.\n\nI made no response, but involuntarily met his eyes. All at once, a\nstrange thing happened to me. I ceased to see what was around me, his\nface itself disappeared from before me, and I could distinguish nothing\nbut the fire of the eyes exactly opposite mine; then it seemed to me\nthat these eyes themselves were piercing into me, then all became\nconfused, I could no longer see anything at all, and I was obliged to\nhalf close my eyelids to free myself from the mingled sensation of joy\nand terror produced by this look.\n\nTowards evening of the day previous to that appointed for our marriage,\nthe weather cleared. After the heavy continuous rains of the summer we\nhad the first brilliant autumnal sunset. The sky was pure, rigid, and\npale. I went to sleep, happy in the thought that the next day would be\nbright, for our wedding. I woke in the morning with the sun upon me, and\nwith the thought that here already was the day ... as if it astonished\nand frightened me. I went to the garden. The sun had just risen, and was\nshining through the linden-trees, whose yellow leaves were floating down\nand strewing the paths. There was not one cloud to be seen in the cold\nserene sky.\n\n"Is it possible that it is to-day?" I asked myself, not venturing to\nbelieve in my own happiness. "Is it possible that to-morrow I shall not\nwake here, that I shall open my eyes in that house of Nikolski, with its\ncolumns, in a place now all strange to me! Is it possible that\nhenceforward I shall not be expecting him, shall not be going to meet\nhim, shall not talk about him any more in the evenings, with Macha?\nShall I no longer sit at the piano in our drawing-room at Pokrovski,\nwith him beside me? Shall I no longer see him go away, and tremble with\nfear for him because the night is dark?" But I remembered that he had\ntold me, the night before, that it was his last visit; and, besides,\nMacha had made me try on my wedding-dress. So that, by moments, I would\nbelieve, and then doubt again. Was it really true that this very day I\nwas to begin to live with a mother-in-law, without Nadine, without old\nGregory, without Macha? That at night I would not embrace my old nurse,\nand hear her say, making the sign of the cross, as she always did;\n"Good-night, my young lady?" That I would no longer hear Sonia\'s\nlessons, or play with her, or rap on the partition wall in the morning\nand hear her gay laugh? Was it possible that it was really to-day that I\nwas to become, in a measure, an alien to myself, and that a new life,\nrealizing my hopes and my wishes, was opening before me? And was it\npossible that this new life, just beginning, was to be for ever? I\nwaited impatiently for Sergius, so hard it was for me to remain alone\nwith these thoughts. He came early, and it was only when he was actually\nthere that I was sure that to-day I was really going to be his wife, and\nno longer felt frightened at the thought.\n\nBefore dinner we went to church, to hear the service for the dead, in\ncommemoration of my father.\n\n"Oh, if he were still in this world!" thought I, as I was returning\nhome, leaning silently on the arm of the man who had been his dearest\nfriend. While the prayers were being read, kneeling with my brow pressed\nupon the cold flag-stones of the chapel floor, my father had been so\nvividly brought before my mind, that I could not help believing that he\ncomprehended me and blessed my choice, and I imagined that, at the\nmoment, his soul was hovering above us, and that his benediction rested\nupon me. These remembrances, these hopes, my happiness and my regrets,\nblended within me into a feeling at once solemn and sweet, which seemed,\nas it were, to be set in a frame of clear quiet air, stillness, bare\nfields, pale heavens whose brilliant but enfeebled rays vainly strove to\nbring the color to my cheek. I persuaded myself that my companion was\nunderstanding and sharing my feelings. He walked with slow steps, in\nsilence, and his face, which I glanced into from time to time, bore the\nimpress of that intense state of the soul, which is neither sadness nor\njoy, and which perfectly harmonized with surrounding nature and with my\nheart.\n\nAll at once, he turned towards me, and I saw that he had something to\nsay to me. What if he were not going to speak of what was in my\nthoughts? But without even naming him he spoke of my father, and added:\n\n"One day he happened to say to me, laughingly, \'You will marry my little\nKatia!\'"\n\n"How glad he would have been, to-day," I responded, pressing closer to\nthe arm on which I leaned.\n\n"Yes, you were then but a child," he went on, looking deep into my eyes;\n"I kissed those eyes and loved them simply because they were so like\nhis, and I was far from thinking that one day they would be so dear to\nme in themselves."\n\nWe were still walking slowly along the field-path, scarcely traceable\namong the trodden and scattered stubble, and heard no sound save our own\nfootsteps and voices. The sun poured down floods of light that gave no\nwarmth. When we spoke, our voices seemed to resound and hang suspended\nabove our heads in the motionless atmosphere. We might have thought we\ntwo were alone upon the earth, alone beneath that blue vault vibrating\nwith cold scintillations from the sun.\n\nWhen we arrived at the house, we found his mother already there, with\nthe few guests whom we had felt obliged to invite, and I was not again\nalone with him until we had left the church and were in the carriage on\nour way to Nikolski.\n\nThe church had been almost empty. At one glance I had seen his mother,\nstanding near the choir; Macha, with her wet cheeks and lilac\ncap-ribbons; and two or three _drorovies_, who were gazing at me with\ncurious eyes. I heard the prayers, I repeated them, but they had no\nmeaning for me. I could not pray, myself, I only kept looking stupidly\nat the images, the wax tapers, the cross embroidered on the chasuble the\npriest had on, the iconostase, the church windows, but did not seem able\nto understand anything at all; I only felt that something very\nextraordinary was being done to me. When the priest turned towards us\nwith the cross, when he gave us his congratulations, and said that he\nhad baptized me and that now God had permitted him also to marry me;\nwhen Macha and Sergius\' mother embraced us, when I heard Gregory\'s voice\ncalling the carriage, I was astonished and frightened at the thought\nthat all was finished, though no marvellous change, corresponding with\nthe sacrament which had just been performed over me, had taken place in\nmy soul. We kissed each other, and this kiss appeared to me so odd, so\nout of keeping with ourselves, that I could not help thinking: "It is\nonly _that_?" We went out upon the parvise, the noise of the wheels\nechoed loudly within the arch of the church; I felt the fresh air upon\nmy face, and was conscious that, Sergius with his hat under his arm, had\nassisted me into the carriage. Through the window I saw that the moon\nwas shining in her place in the frosty sky. He took his seat beside me,\nand shut the door. Something, at this moment, seemed to strike through\nmy heart, as if the assurance with which he did this had given me a\nwound. The wheels glanced against a stone, then began to revolve upon\nthe smooth road, and we were gone. Drawn back into a corner of the\ncarriage, I watched the fields flooded with light, and the flying road.\nNevertheless, without looking at him, I was feeling that there he was,\nbeside me. "Here, then, is all that this first moment from which I have\nexpected so much, brings me?" I thought, and all at once I had a sense\nof humiliation and offence at finding myself seated thus alone with him\nand so close to him. I turned towards him, intending to say something,\nno matter what. But no word would come from my lips; one would have said\nthat no trace of my former tenderness lingered within my heart, but that\nit was entirely replaced by this impression of alarm and offence.\n\n"Up to this moment, I still dared not believe that this might be!" he\nsoftly responded to my glance.\n\n"And I ... I am afraid ... I know not why!"\n\n"Afraid of me, Katia?" he said, taking my hand, and bending his head\nover it.\n\nMy hand rested within his, lifeless; my heart stopped beating.\n\n"Yes," I murmured.\n\nBut, at the same moment, my heart suddenly began to beat again, my hand\ntrembled and clasped his, warmth returned to me; my eyes, in the dim\nlight, sought his eyes, and I felt, all at once, that I was no longer\nafraid of him; that this terror had been but a new love, yet more tender\nand strong than the old. I knew that I was wholly his, and that I was\nhappy to be wholly in his power.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\nThe days, the weeks, two entire months of lonely country life slipped\naway, imperceptibly, it appeared to us; but the sensations, the\nemotions, and the happiness of these two months would have sufficed to\nfill a whole life. My dreams, and his, concerning the mode of organizing\nour joint existence were not realized exactly as we had anticipated.\nBut, nevertheless, the reality was not below our dreams. This was not\nthe life of strict industry, full of duties, abnegation, and sacrifices,\nwhich I had pictured to myself when I became his betrothed; on the\ncontrary, it was the absorbing and egotistical sentiment of love, joys\nwithout reason and without end, oblivion of everything in the world. He\nwould, it is true, sometimes retire to his study and occupy himself with\nsomething demanding attention; sometimes he went to the city on\nbusiness, or overlooked his agricultural matters; but I could see how\nhard it was for him to tear himself away from me. Indeed, he himself\nsaid that whenever I was not present, things appeared to him so devoid\nof interest that the wonder was that he could attend to them at all. It\nwas precisely the same on my side. I read, I busied myself with my\nmusic, with Mamma, with the schools; but I only did so because all these\nemployments were in some way connected with him, and met with his\napprobation, and the instant the thought of him ceased to be in some\nmanner, direct or indirect, associated with anything whatever that I was\ndoing, I would stop doing it. To me, he was the only person in the\nuniverse, the handsomest, noblest human being in the wide world; of\ncourse, therefore, I could live for nothing but him, could strive for\nnothing but to remain in his eyes what he considered me. For he honestly\nconsidered me the first and highest of women, gifted with every\nexcellence and charm; and my one aim was to be in reality for him this\nhighest and most complete of all existing creatures.\n\nOurs was one of those old country homes, where generation after\ngeneration of ancestors had lived, loved each other, and peacefully\npassed away. The very walls seemed to breathe out happy household\nmemories, and no sooner had I set my foot upon the threshold, than these\nall appeared to become memories of my own. The arrangement and order of\nthe dwelling were old-fashioned, carefully kept so by Tatiania\nSemenovna. No one could have said that anything was handsome or elegant,\nbut everything, from the attendance to the furniture and the food, was\nproper, solid, regular, and seemed to inspire respect. In the\ndrawing-room, tables, chairs, and divans were symmetrically ranged, the\nwalls were hidden by family portraits, and the floor was covered with\nancient rugs and immense landscapes in linen. In the small parlor there\nwas an old grand piano, two chiffoniers of different shapes, a divan,\nand one or two tables decorated with wrought copper. My private room,\nadorned by Tatiana Semenovna, was honored with all the finest pieces of\nfurniture, irrespective of varying styles and dates, and, among the\nrest, with an old mirror with doors, which at first I hardly dared to\nraise my eyes to, but which afterwards became like a dear old friend to\nme. Tatiana\'s voice was never heard, but the household went on with the\nregularity of a well-wound clock, although there were many more servants\nthan were necessary. But all these servants, wearing their soft heelless\nslippers (for Tatiana Semenovna insisted that creaking soles and\npounding heels were, of all things in the world, the most disagreeable),\nall these servants appeared proud of their condition, trembling before\nthe old lady, showing to my husband and me a protecting good-will, and\nseeming to take special satisfaction in the discharge of their\nrespective duties. Every Saturday, regularly, the floors were scoured,\nand the carpets shaken; on the first day of every month, a _Te Deum_ was\nchanted, and holy water sprinkled; while upon every recurring fete-day\nof Tatiana Semenovna and her son, and now also upon mine (which took\nplace this autumn, for the first time), a feast was given to all the\nneighborhood. And all this was performed precisely as in the oldest\ntimes that Tatiana Semenovna could remember.\n\nMy husband interfered in nothing concerning the management of the house,\nconfining himself to the control of the estate, and the affairs of the\npeasants, which fully occupied him.\n\nHe rose very early, even during the winter, so that he was always gone\nwhen I woke. He generally returned for tea, which we took alone\ntogether; and at these times, having finished the troubles and\nannoyances of his agricultural matters, he would often fall into that\nparticularly joyous light-hearted state of mind, which we used to call\n_le transport sauvage_. Often, when I asked him to tell me what he had\nbeen doing all the morning, he would relate such perfectly absurd\nadventures, that we would almost die of laughing; sometimes when I\ndemanded a sober account, he would give it to me, making an effort to\nrestrain even a smile. As for me, I watched his eyes, or the motion of\nhis lips, and did not understand a word he said, being entirely taken up\nwith the pleasure of looking at him and hearing his voice.\n\n"Come, now, what was I saying?" he would ask; "repeat it to me!"\n\nBut I never could repeat any of it.\n\nTatiana Semenovna never made her appearance until dinner time, taking\nher tea alone, and only sending an ambassador to wish us good-morning. I\nalways found it hard not to burst out laughing, when the maid entered,\ntook her stand before us with her hands crossed one upon the other, and,\nin her measured tones informed us that Tatiana Semenovna desired to know\nwhether we had slept well, and whether we liked the little cakes we had\nfor tea. Until dinner time we seldom remained together. I played, or\nread, alone; he wrote, or sometimes went out again; but at four o\'clock\nwe went down to the drawing-room for dinner. Mamma came out of her\nchamber, and then the poor gentle-folk and pilgrims who happened to be\nlodging in the house, usually two or three in number made their\nappearance. Regularly every day my husband, following the ancient\ncustom, offered his arm to his mother, to conduct her to the\ndining-room, and she requested him to take me upon his other arm. Mamma\npresided at dinner, and the conversation was of a serious, thoughtful\nturn, not altogether without a shade of solemnity. The simple every-day\ntalk between my husband and myself was the only agreeable diversion in\nthe grave aspect of these table sessions. After dinner, Mamma took her\nseat in a large arm-chair in the salon, and cut open the leaves of any\nnewly-arrived books; we read aloud, or went to the piano in the small\ndrawing-room. We read a great deal together during those two months, but\nmusic continued to be our supreme enjoyment, for every day it seemed to\nstrike some new chord in our hearts, whose vibrations revealed us to\neach other more and more wholly. When I was playing his favorite airs he\nretired to a divan at some distance, where I could scarcely see him, and\nwith a kind of modesty of sentiment tried to conceal from me the emotion\nmy music produced; but, often, when he least expected it, I rose from\nthe piano and ran to him, to try to surprise upon his countenance the\ntraces of this deep feeling and to catch the almost supernatural light\nin the humid eyes which he vainly strove to conceal from me. I presided\nover our late tea in the large drawing-room, again all the family were\ngathered round the table, and for a long time this formal assembling\nnear the samovar, as in a tribunal, with the distribution of the cups\nand glasses, discomposed me very much. It always seemed to me that I was\nnot yet worthy of these honors, that I was too young, too giddy, to turn\nthe faucet of that stately samovar, set the cups on Nikita\'s tray and\nsay: "For Peter Ivanovitch; for Maria Minichna," and ask: "Is it sweet\nenough?" And afterwards give out the lumps of sugar for the white-haired\nnurse and the other old servants. "Perfect, perfect," my husband would\noften tell me; "quite a grown-up person!" and then I would feel more\nintimidated than ever.\n\nAfter tea Mamma played patience, or she and Maria Minichna had a game of\ncards together; then she embraced us both and gave us her blessing, and\nwe withdrew to our own apartment. There, however, our evening\n_tete-a-tete_ was usually prolonged until midnight, for these were our\npleasantest hours in the twenty-four. He told me about his past life, we\nmade plans, occasionally we philosophized, all the time talking in a low\ntone lest we might be overheard. We lived, he and I, almost upon the\nfooting of strangers in this huge old house, where everything seemed to\nbe weighed upon by the severe spirit of ancient times and of Tatiana\nSemenovna. Not only she herself, but also the servants, all these old\nmen and women, the furniture, the pictures, all inspired me with respect\nand a kind of fear, and at the same time with the consciousness that my\nhusband and I were not exactly in our own place there and that our\nconduct must be extremely circumspect. As well as I remember, now, this\nsevere order and the prodigious number of idle, inquisitive men and\nwomen about our house were very hard to bear: but even this sense of\noppression only served to vivify our mutual love. Not only I, but he\nalso, made an effort not to let it be seen that anything in our home was\ndispleasing to us. Sometimes this calmness, this indulgence, this\nseeming indifference to everything, irritated me, and I could not help\nlooking upon such conduct as weakness, and telling him so.\n\n"Ah, dear Katia," he replied, once, when I was expressing my annoyance,\n"how can a man show that anything, no matter what, is displeasing to\nhim, when he is as happy as I am? It is a great deal easier to yield,\nthan to make them yield, I have long been convinced of that,--and,\nmoreover, of the fact there is no situation where one cannot be happy.\nEverything goes so well with us! I do not even know, any longer, how to\nget angry; for me, just now, there is nothing at all that is bad, there\nare only things that are either dull or droll. But, above all, \'let well\nenough alone.\' You may hardly believe me, but whenever I hear a ring at\nthe door-bell, whenever I receive a letter, actually whenever I wake in\nthe morning, a fear takes hold of me, fear of the obligations of life,\nfear that something may be going to change; for nothing could be better\nthan this present moment!"\n\nI believed him, but I could not understand him. I was happy, but it\nseemed to me that all was as it ought to be, and could not be otherwise;\nthat it was the same with every one else, and that somewhere there were\nother joys still, not greater ones, but quite different.\n\nThus two months passed by, bringing us to the cold, stormy winter, and\nalthough he was with me, I began to feel somewhat alone; I began to feel\nthat life was doing nothing but repeating itself, as it were; that it\noffered nothing new either for me or for him; that, on the contrary, we\nseemed to be forever treading over and over again in our own footsteps.\nHe was more frequently occupied with business matters away from me, than\nhe had been at first, and once more I had the old feeling that far down\nin his soul lay a world, hidden and reserved, to which he would not\nadmit me. His unalterable serenity irritated me. I loved him no less\nthan formerly, was no less happy in his love; but my love remained\nstationary and did not seem to grow any more, and besides this love a\nnew sentiment, full of anxiety, came creeping into my heart. Continuing\nto love seemed to me so small a thing after that great transport of\nfirst loving him; I felt as if my sentiments ought to include agitation,\ndanger, sacrifice of myself. There were in me exuberant forces finding\nno employment in our tranquil existence, fits of depression which I\nsought to conceal from him as something wicked, fits of impetuous\ntenderness and gaiety which only alarmed him. He still had his old habit\nof watching me and studying my moods, and one day he came to me with a\nproposal to move to the city for a time; but I begged him not to go, not\nto alter anything whatever in our mode of life, not to touch our\nhappiness. And, really and truly, I was happy; but I was tormenting\nmyself because this happiness brought me no labor, no sacrifice, while,\nI felt all the powers of sacrifice and labor dying away within me. I\nloved him, I knew that I was entirely his; but I wished every one to see\nour love, wished that some one would try to prevent my loving him,--and\nthen to love him all the same! My mind, and even my sentiments, found\ntheir field of action, but yet there was something--the sense of youth,\nwith its need of movement--which had no sufficient satisfaction in our\nplacid life. Why did he tell me that we could go to the city whenever\nthe fancy seized me to do so? If he had not said this, perhaps I might\nhave understood that the feeling which oppressed me was a pernicious\nchimera, a fault of which I was guilty.... But the thought kept coming\ninto my head that simply by going to the city, I could escape from my\nennui; but then, on the other hand, this would be withdrawing him from a\nlife that he loved; I was ashamed to do this, but it cost me something\nnot to do it.\n\nTime went on, the snow piled higher and higher against the walls of the\nhouse, and we were always alone, still alone, always with each other,\nwhile away yonder,--I knew not where, but yonder somewhere,--in stir and\nmotion, in splendor and excitement, was the crowd, feeling, suffering,\nrejoicing, amusing itself, without one thought of us and our vanished\nexistence. Worst of all to me was the consciousness that day by day the\nchain of habit was binding and pressing our life closer into its narrow\nmould, that our love itself would enter into bondage and become subject\nto the monotonous and dispassionate law of time. To be cheerful in the\nmorning, respectful at dinner, affectionate in the evening! "To do\ngood!" I said to myself, it is all very well and admirable to do good,\nand to live a worthy life, as he says; but we have yet time enough for\nthat; there are other things for which, to-day, I feel powers within me.\nThis is not what I wanted; what I wanted was combat, struggle; was to\nfeel that love is our guide in life, not that life guides our love. I\ncould have wished to draw near to the abyss with him, to say to him:\n"One more step, and I dash myself down, one more movement and I perish;"\nhe, while paling on the brink of this abyss, he would have seized me\nwith his powerful hand, held me there suspended above the gulf, my heart\nfaint with fear,--and then he might have borne me whithersoever he\nwould!\n\nThis mood of my soul began to tell upon my health, my nerves began to\nbe out of order. One morning I felt even more upset than usual, and\nSergius returned home in rather a bad temper, which was an extremely\nrare occurrence with him; I noticed it at once, and asked him what was\nthe matter, but he would not tell me, only remarking that it was not\nworth while. As I afterwards learned, the ispravnik,[G] from ill-will to\nmy husband, had summoned several peasants, made some illegal exaction of\nthem, and had even uttered menaces against him. My husband had not yet\nbeen able to look into the matter and, moreover, as it was but a piece\nof absurd impertinence he had not cared to tell me of it; but I imagined\nthat his not telling me was because he considered me a child, and that\nin his eyes I was incapable of understanding what interested him. I\nturned from him in silence, without saying a word; he went into his\nstudy, gravely, and shut his door after him. When I could no longer hear\nhim, I sat down on a divan, almost crying. "Why," said I to myself,\n"does he persist in humiliating me by his solemn calmness, by being\nalways in the right? Am I not in the right also, when I am wearied, when\neverywhere I feel emptiness, when I long to live, to move, not to stay\nforever in one place and feel time walk over me? I wish to go onward,\neach day, each hour; I wish for something new, while he,--he wants to\nstand still in one spot, and keep me standing there with him! And yet\nhow easy it would be for him to satisfy me! He need not take me to the\ncity, it would only be necessary for him to be a little like me, for him\nto stop trying to constrain and crush himself with his own hands, for\nhim to live naturally. That is what he is always advising me, and it is\nhe who is not natural, that is all."\n\nI felt my tears getting the mastery of me, and my irritation against him\nincreasing. I was afraid of this irritation, and I went to find him. He\nwas sitting in his study, writing. Hearing my steps, he turned for an\ninstant, looked at me with a calm and indifferent air, and continued\nwriting; this look did not please me, and instead of going up to him, I\nstopped near the table where he was writing and, opening a book, began\nto run my eyes over the page. He turned then, a second time, and looked\nat me again:\n\n"Katia, you are not as bright as usual!"\n\nI only responded by a cold glance, meant to convey: "And why? And why so\nmuch amiability?" He shook his head at me, and smiled timidly and\ntenderly; but, for the first time, my smile would not answer his.\n\n"What was the matter with you this morning?" I asked, "why would you\ntell me nothing?"\n\n"It was a trifle! a slight worry," he replied. "I can tell you all about\nit, now. Two peasants had been summoned to the city...."\n\nBut I would not let him finish.\n\n"Why did you not tell me when I asked you?"\n\n"I might have said something foolish, I was angry then."\n\n"That was just the time to tell me."\n\n"And why so?"\n\n"What you think, then, is that I never can help you in anything?"\n\n"What I think?" said he, throwing down his pen. "I think that without\nyou I could not live. In all things, in all, not only are you a help to\nme, but it is by you that everything is done. You are literally to me\n\'well-fallen,\'" he went on smiling. "It is in you alone that I live; it\nseems to me nothing is good but because you are there, because you\nmust...."\n\n"Yes, I know it, I am a nice little child who has to be petted and kept\nquiet," said I, in such a tone that he looked at me in amazement. "But I\ndo not want this quieting; I have had enough of it!"\n\n"Come, let me tell you about this morning\'s trouble," he said hastily,\nas if he was afraid to give me time to say more: "let us see what you\nthink of it!"\n\n"I do not wish to hear it now," I replied.\n\nI really did want to hear it, but it was more agreeable to me, at this\nmoment, to disturb his tranquillity.\n\n"I do not wish to play with the things of life; I wish to live," I\nadded; "like you."\n\nHis face, which always so clearly and so readily reflected every\nimpression, wore a look of suffering and intense attention.\n\n"I wish to live with you in perfect equality...."\n\nBut I could not finish, such profound pain was on his face. He was\nsilent an instant.\n\n"And in what do you not live with me on a footing of equality?" he said:\n"it is I, not you, that is concerned in this affair of the ispravnik and\nsome drunken peasants."\n\n"Yes, but it is not only this case," said I.\n\n"For the love of God, do understand me, my darling," he continued; "I\nknow how painful a thing care is for us all; I have lived, and I know\nit. I love you, therefore I would spare you every care. My life is\ncentred in my love for you; so do not prevent my living!"\n\n"You are always right," said I, without looking at him.\n\nI could not bear to see him once more serene and tranquil, while I was\nso full of anger and a feeling somewhat resembling repentance.\n\n"Katia! What is the matter with you?" said he. "The question is not in\nthe least which of us two is in the right, what we were talking about is\nsomething entirely different! What have you against me? Do not tell me\nat once; reflect, and then tell me all that is in your thoughts. You are\ndispleased with me, you have, no doubt, a reason, but explain to me in\nwhat I am to blame."\n\nBut how could I tell him all that I had in the bottom of my heart? The\nthought that he had seen through me at once, that again I found myself\nas a child before him, that I could do nothing that he did not\ncomprehend and foresee, excited me more than ever.\n\n"I have nothing against you," said I, "but I am tired, and I do not like\nennui. You say that this must be so, and, of course, once more you are\nright!"\n\nAs I spoke, I looked in his face. My object was attained; his serenity\nhad disappeared; alarm and pain were stamped upon his face.\n\n"Katia!" he began, in a low, agitated voice, "this is no jesting we are\nengaged in, at this moment. Our fate is being decided. I ask you to say\nnothing, only to hear me. Why are you torturing me thus?"\n\nBut I broke in.\n\n"Say no more, you are right," said I, coldly, as if it were not I, but\nsome evil spirit speaking with my lips.\n\n"If you knew what you are doing!" he exclaimed in a trembling voice.\n\nI began to cry, and I felt my heart somewhat relieved. He was sitting\nnear me, silent. I was sorry for him, ashamed of myself, troubled by\nwhat I had done. I did not look at him. I felt sure that he was looking\nat me, and that his eyes were perplexed or severe. I turned; his eyes\nwere indeed fixed upon me, but they were kind and gentle and seemed\nentreating forgiveness. I took his hand, and said:\n\n"Pardon me! I do not know, myself, what I said."\n\n"Yes, but I know what you said, and I know that you spoke the truth."\n\n"What truth?" I asked.\n\n"That we must go to St. Petersburg. This is no longer the place for us."\n\n"As you wish."\n\nHe took me in his arms and kissed me.\n\n"You forgive me?" he said, "I have been to blame concerning you...."\n\nIn the evening I was at the piano a long time playing for him, while he\nwalked up and down the room, repeating something in a low tone to\nhimself. This was a habit with him, and I often asked him what he was\nmurmuring thus, and he, still thoughtful, would repeat it again to me;\ngenerally it was poetry, sometimes some really absurd thing, but even\nthe very absurdity would show me what frame of mind he was in.\n\n"What are you murmuring there, now?" I asked after a time.\n\nHe stood still, thought a little, then, smiling, repeated the two lines\nfrom Lermontoff:\n\n    "And he, the madman, invoked the tempest,\n     As if, in the tempest, peace might reign!"\n\n"Yes, he is more than a man; he sees everything!" thought I; "how can I\nhelp loving him!"\n\nI left the piano, took hold of his hand, and began to walk up and down\nwith him, measuring my steps by his.\n\n"Well!" he said, looking down at me with a smile.\n\n"Well!" I echoed; and our two hearts seemed to spring to each other once\nmore.\n\nAt the end of a fortnight, before the fetes, we were in St. Petersburg.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\nOur removal to St. Petersburg, a week in Moscow, visits to his relatives\nand to my own, settling ourselves in our new apartment, the journey, the\nnew city, the new faces, all seemed to me like a dream. All was so\nnovel, so changeful, so gay, all was so brightened for me by his\npresence, by his love, that the placid country life appeared to me\nsomething very far off, a sort of unreal thing. To my great surprise,\ninstead of the arrogant pride, the coldness, I had expected to\nencounter, I was welcomed by all (not only by our relatives, but by\nstrangers,) with such cordiality that it seemed as if they had no\nthought of anything but me, and as if one and all had been longing for\nmy arrival to complete their own happiness. Contrary to my\nanticipations, in the circles of society, even in those which seemed to\nme most select, I discovered many friends and connections of my husband\nwhom he had never mentioned to me, and it often struck me as strange and\ndisagreeable to hear him utter severe strictures upon some of these\npersons who seemed to me so good. I could not understand why he treated\nthem so coldly, or why he tried to avoid some acquaintances whose\nintimacy I thought rather flattering. I thought that the more one knew\nof nice people, the better it was, and all these were nice people.\n\n"Let us see how we shall arrange things," he had said to me before we\nleft the country: "here, we are little Croesuses, and there we shall be\nfar from rich; so we cannot remain in the city longer than Easter, and\nwe cannot go much into society, or we shall find ourselves embarrassed;\nand I would not like you...."\n\n"Why go into society?" I had answered; "we will only visit our\nrelatives, go to the theatre and opera, and to hear any good music, and\neven before Easter we can be at home again in the country."\n\nBut scarcely were we in St. Petersburg than all these fine plans were\nforgotten. I had been suddenly thrown into a world so new, so happy, so\nmany delights had surrounded me, so many objects of heretofore unknown\ninterest were offered to me, that all in a moment, as it were, and\nwithout being conscious of it, I disavowed all my past, I upset all the\nplans formerly arranged. Until now there had been nothing but play; as\nto life itself, it had not yet begun; but here it was now, the real, the\ntrue,--and what will it be in the future? thought I. The anxieties, the\nfits of depression, which came upon me in the country, disappeared\nsuddenly as if by enchantment. My love for my husband became calmer,\nand, on the other hand, it never occurred to me, in this new life, to\nthink that he was loving me less than formerly. Indeed, it was not\npossible for me to doubt this love; each thought was instantly\nunderstood by him, each sentiment shared, each wish gratified. His\nunalterable serenity had vanished, here, or perhaps it had only ceased\nto cause me any irritation. I even felt that besides his old love for me\nhe seemed now to find some new charm in me. Often, after a visit, after\nI had made some new acquaintance, or after an evening at home, when,\nwith secret misgiving lest I should commit some blunder, I had been\nperforming the duties of hostess, he would say to me:\n\n"Well, my little girl! bravo! well done, indeed!"\n\nThis would fill me with delight.\n\nA short time after our arrival he wrote to his mother, and, as he handed\nme the letter to let me add a few words, he said I must not read what he\nhad written; I laughingly persisted in seeing it, and read:\n\n"You would not recognize Katia, I hardly recognize her myself. Where\ncould she have acquired this lovely and graceful ease of manner, this\naffability, this fascination, this sweet, unconscious tact? And still\nalways so simple, so gentle, so full of kindness. Every one is delighted\nwith her; and as for me, I am never tired of admiring her, and, if that\nwere possible, would be more in love with her than ever."\n\n"This, then, is what I am?" I thought. And it gave me so much pleasure\nand gratification that I felt as if I loved him more than ever. My\nsuccess with all our acquaintances was a thing absolutely unexpected by\nme. On all sides I was told: here, that I had particularly pleased my\nuncle, there, that an aunt was raving over me; by this one, that there\nwas not a woman in all St. Petersburg like me; by that one, that if I\nchose there would not be a woman in society so sought after as myself.\nThere was one cousin of my husband especially, Princess D., a lady of\nhigh rank and fashion, no longer young, who announced that she had\nfallen in love with me at first sight, and who did more than any one\nelse to turn my head with flattering attentions. When, for the first\ntime, this cousin proposed to me to go to a ball, and broached the\nsubject to my husband, he turned towards me with an almost imperceptible\nsmile, and mischievous glance, and asked if I wanted to go. I nodded,\nand felt my face flush.\n\n"One would say, a little culprit, confessing a wish," he said, laughing\ngood-humoredly.\n\n"You told me we must not go into company, and that you would not like\nit," I responded, smiling also, and giving him an entreating glance.\n\n"If you wish it very much, we will go."\n\n"Indeed, I would rather...."\n\n"Do you wish it, wish it very much?" he repeated.\n\nI made no answer.\n\n"The greatest harm is not in the world, society, itself," he went on;\n"it is unsatisfied worldly aspirations that are so evil, so unhealthful.\nCertainly we must go,--and we will go," he concluded, unhesitatingly.\n\n"To tell you the truth," I replied, "there is nothing in the world I\nlong for so much as to go to this ball!"\n\nWe went to it, and my delight was far beyond all my anticipations. At\nthis ball, even more than before, it seemed to me that I was the centre\naround which everything was revolving; that it was for me alone that\nthis splendid room was in a blaze of light, that the music was sounding,\nthat the gay throng was gathering in ecstasy before me. All, from the\nhair-dresser and my maid to the dancers, and even the stately old\ngentlemen who slowly walked about through the rooms, watching the\nyounger people, seemed to me to be either implying or telling me in\ndownright speech that they were wild about me. The impression which I\nproduced at this ball, and which my cousin proudly confided to me, was\nsummed up in the general verdict that I was not the least in the world\nlike other women, and that there was about me some peculiar quality\nwhich recalled the simplicity and charm of the country. This success\nflattered me so much that I frankly owned to my husband how I longed to\ngo to at least two or three of the balls to be given in the course of\nthe winter, "in order," I said, despite a sharp little whisper from my\nconscience, "that I may be satiated, once for all!"\n\nMy husband willingly consented to this, and at first accompanied me,\nwith evident pride and pleasure in my success, apparently forgetting or\ndisavowing what he had formerly decided on principle.\n\nBut after awhile I could see that he was bored, and growing tired of the\nlife we were leading. However, this was not yet clear enough to my eyes\nfor me to understand the full significance of the grave, watchful look\nhe sometimes directed towards me, even if I noticed the look at all. I\nwas so intoxicated by this love which I seemed so suddenly to have\naroused in all these strangers, by this perfume of elegance, pleasure,\nand novelty, which I here breathed for the first time; by the apparent\nremoval of what had hitherto, as it were, held me down, namely, the\nmoral weight of my husband; it was so sweet to me, not only to walk\nthrough this new world on a level with him, but to find the place given\nme there even higher than his, and yet to love him with all the more\nstrength and independence than before; that I could not understand that\nhe looked on with displeasure at my utter delight in this worldly\nexistence.\n\nI felt a new thrill of pride and deep satisfaction, when upon entering a\nball-room, all eyes would turn towards me; and when he, as if disdaining\nto parade before the multitude his rights of proprietorship, would\nquietly and at once leave my side and go off to be lost in the mass of\nblack coats.\n\n"Only wait!" I often thought, as my eyes sought him out at the end of\nthe room, and rested on his face, dimly seen from the distance between\nus, but sometimes with a very weary look upon it; "wait! when we are at\nhome again you shall see and know for whom I have been glad to be so\nbeautiful and so brilliant, you shall know whom I love far, far above\nall around me this evening." It seemed to me, very sincerely, that my\ndelight in my successes was only for his sake, and also because they\nenabled me to sacrifice even themselves for him. "One thing alone," I\nthought, "might be a danger to me in this life in the world: that is,\nthat one of the men I meet here might conceive a passion for me, and my\nhusband might grow jealous of him; but he had such confidence in me, he\nappeared to be so calm and indifferent, and all these young men seemed\nin my eyes so empty in comparison with him, that this peril, the only\none, as I thought, with which social life could threaten me, had no\nterrors at all. Still, the attentions I received from so many persons in\nsociety gave me such pleasure, such a sense of satisfied self-love that\nI rather felt as if there was some merit in my very love for my husband,\nwhile at the same time it seemed to impress upon my relation to him\ngreater ease and freedom.\n\n"I noticed how very animated your manner was, while you were talking to\nN. N.," I said to him, one evening, upon our return from a ball; and I\nshook my finger at him as I named a well-known lady of St. Petersburg\nwith whom he had spent part of the evening. I only meant to tease him a\nlittle, for he was silent, and had a wearied look.\n\n"Ah, why say such a thing? And for you to say it, Katia!" he exclaimed,\nfrowning, and pressing his lips together as if in physical pain. "That\nis not like you,--not becoming your position, or mine. Leave such\nspeeches to others; bad jests of that kind might entirely do away with\nour good understanding,--and I still hope that this good understanding\nmay return."\n\nI felt confused, and was silent.\n\n"Will it return, Katia? What do you think?" he asked.\n\n"It is not changed,--it will never change," I said, and then I firmly\nbelieved my assertion.\n\n"May God grant it!" he exclaimed, "but it is time we were going back to\nthe country."\n\nThis was the only occasion upon which he spoke to me in this way, and\nthe rest of the time it seemed to me that everything was going on as\ndelightfully for him as for me,--and as for me, oh! I was so\nlight-hearted, so joyous! If occasionally I happened to notice that he\nwas wearied, I would console myself by reflecting how long, for his\nsake, I had been wearied in the country; if our relations seemed to be\nundergoing some little alteration, I thought how speedily they would\nresume their old charm when we should find ourselves again alone, in the\nsummer, at our own Nikolski.\n\nThus the winter sped away without my realizing it; and Easter came, and,\ndespite all our resolutions we were still in St. Petersburg.\n\nThe Sunday following, however, we were really ready to go, everything\nwas packed, my husband had made his final purchases of flowers, gifts,\nthings of all kinds which were needed for the country, and was in one of\nhis happiest, most affectionate moods. Shortly before we were to start,\nwe had an unexpected visit from our cousin, who came to beg us to\npostpone our departure one week, so that we might attend a reception\ngiven by Countess R. on Saturday. She reminded me that I had already\nreceived several invitations from Countess R., which had been declined,\nand told me that Prince M., then in St. Petersburg, had, at the last\nball, expressed a desire to make my acquaintance, that it was with this\nobject in view that he purposed attending this reception, and that he\nwas saying everywhere that I was the loveliest woman in Russia. The\nwhole city would be there,--in one word, I must go! It would be nothing\nwithout me.\n\nMy husband was at the other end of the room, talking to some one.\n\n"So you will certainly come, Katia?" said my cousin.\n\n"We meant to leave for the country, day after to-morrow," I replied,\ndoubtfully, as I glanced at my husband. Our eyes met, and he turned away\nabruptly.\n\n"I will persuade him to stay," said my cousin, "and on Saturday we will\nturn all heads,--won\'t we?"\n\n"Our plans would be disarranged, all our packing is done," I objected\nfeebly, beginning to waver.\n\n"Perhaps she had better go to-day, at once, to pay her respects to the\nprince!" observed my husband from his end of the room, with some\nirritation, and in a dictatorial tone I had never heard from him before.\n\n"Why, he is getting jealous; I see it for the first time!" exclaimed our\ncousin, ironically. "It is not for the prince alone, Sergius\nMikailovitch, but for all of us, that I want her. That is why Countess\nR. is so urgent."\n\n"It depends upon herself," returned my husband, coldly, as he left the\nroom.\n\nI had seen that he was much more agitated than usual; this troubled me,\nand I would not give a decided answer to my cousin. As soon as she was\ngone, I went to look for my husband. He was thoughtfully walking up and\ndown his chamber, and neither saw nor heard me, as I stole softly in on\ntiptoe.\n\n"He is picturing to himself his dear Nikolski," thought I, watching him,\n"he is thinking about his morning coffee in that light drawing-room, his\nfields, his peasants, his evenings at home, and his secret little night\nsuppers! Yes," I decided, in my own mind, "I would give all the balls in\nthe world, and the flatteries of every prince in the universe, to have\nagain his bright joyousness and his loving caresses!"\n\nI was about telling him that I was not going to the reception, that I no\nlonger cared to go, when he suddenly glanced behind him. At the sight of\nme, his brow darkened, and the dreamy gentleness of his countenance\nchanged entirely. The well-known look came to his face, the look of\npenetrating wisdom and patronizing calmness. He would not let me see in\nhim simple human nature: he must remain for me the demi-god upon his\npedestal!\n\n"What is it, my love?" he enquired, turning towards me with quiet\ncarelessness.\n\nI did not answer. I resented his hiding himself from me, his not\nallowing me to see him as I best loved him.\n\n"So you wish to go to this reception, on Saturday?" he continued.\n\n"I did wish to go," I replied, "but it did not suit you. And then, too,\nthe packing is done," I added.\n\nNever had he looked at me so coldly, never spoken so coldly.\n\n"I shall not leave before Tuesday, and I will order the packing to be\nundone," he said; "we will not go until you choose. Do me the favor to\ngo to this entertainment. I shall not leave the city."\n\nAs was his habit when excited, he went on walking about the room with\nquick, irregular steps, and did not look at me.\n\n"Most decidedly, I do not understand you," I said, putting myself in his\nway, and following him with my eyes. "Why do you speak to me in such a\nsingular manner? I am quite ready to sacrifice this pleasure to you, and\nyou, with sarcasm you have never before shown, you require that I shall\ngo!"\n\n"Come! come! You _sacrifice_ yourself" (he laid strong emphasis on the\nword), "and I, I _sacrifice_ myself also! Combat of generosity! There, I\nhope, is what may be called \'family happiness\'!"\n\nThis was the first time I had ever heard from his lips words so hard and\nsatirical. His satire did not touch, and his hardness did not frighten\nme, but they became contagious. Was it really he, always so opposed to\nany debating between us, always so simple and straightforward, who was\nspeaking to me thus? And why? Just because I had offered to sacrifice\nmyself to his pleasure, which was really the supreme thing in my eyes;\njust because, at this moment, with the thought, came the comprehension\nof how much I loved him. Our characters were reversed; it was he who had\nlost all frankness and simplicity, and I who had found them.\n\n"You are so changed," said I, sighing. "Of what am I guilty in your\neyes? It is not this reception, but some old sin, which you are casting\nup against me in your heart. Why not use more sincerity? You were not\nafraid of it with me, once. Speak out,--what have you against me?"\n\n"No matter what he may say," I thought, quickly running over the events\nof the season in my mind, "there is not one thing that he has a right to\nreproach me with, this whole winter."\n\nI went and stood in the middle of the room, so that he would be obliged\nto pass near me, and I looked at him. I said to myself: "He will come\nclose to me, he will put his arms around me and kiss me, and that will\nbe the end of it all;" this thought darted into my head, and it even\ncost me something to let it end so, without my proving to him that he\nwas in the wrong. But he stood still at the end of the room, and,\nlooking in my face:\n\n"You still do not understand me?" he said.\n\n"No."\n\n"Yet ... how can I tell you?... I am appalled, for the first time, I am\nappalled at what I see--what I cannot but see." He stopped, evidently\nfrightened at the rough tone of his voice.\n\n"What do you mean?" I demanded, indignant tears filling my eyes.\n\n"I am appalled that, knowing the prince\'s comments on your beauty, you\nshould, after that, be so ready and willing to run after him, forgetting\nyour husband, yourself, your own dignity as a woman,--and then for you\nnot to understand what your husband has to feel in your stead, since you\nyourself have not this sense of your own dignity!--far from it, you come\nand declare to your husband that you will _sacrifice_ yourself, which is\nequivalent to saying, \'To please His Highness would be my greatest\nhappiness, but I will _sacrifice_ it.\'"\n\nThe more he said, the more the sound of his own voice excited him, and\nthe harder, more cutting and violent, became his voice. I had never\nseen, and had never expected to see him thus; the blood surged to my\nheart; I was frightened, but yet, at the same time, a sense of unmerited\ndisgrace and offended self-love aroused me, and I keenly longed to take\nsome vengeance on him.\n\n"I have long expected this outbreak," said I, "speak, speak!"\n\n"I do not know what you may have expected," he went on, "but I might\nhave anticipated still worse things, from seeing you day by day steeped\nin this slime, this idleness, this luxury, this senseless society; and I\ndid anticipate.... I did anticipate this that to-day covers me with\nshame, and sinks me in misery such as I have never experienced; shame\nfor myself, when your dear friend, prying and fumbling about in my heart\nwith her unclean fingers, spoke of my jealousy,--and jealousy of whom?\nOf a man whom neither you nor I have ever seen! And you, as if\npurposely, you will not understand me, you \'will sacrifice\' to\nme,--whom? Great God!... Shame on your degradation! Sacrifice!" he\nrepeated once more.\n\n"Ah, this then is what is meant by the husband\'s authority," I thought.\n"To insult and humiliate his wife, who is not guilty of the very least\nthing in the world! Here then are \'marital rights;\'--but I, for one,\nwill never submit to them!"\n\n"Well, I sacrifice _nothing_ to you, then," I returned, feeling my\nnostrils dilate, and my face grow bloodless. "I will go to the reception\non Saturday. I most certainly will go!"\n\n"And God give you pleasure in it! Only--all is ended between us!" he\nexclaimed, in an uncontrollable transport of rage. "At least you shall\nnot make a martyr of me any longer. I was a fool who...."\n\nBut his lips trembled, and he made a visible effort not to finish what\nhe had begun to say.\n\nAt this moment I was afraid of him and I hated him. I longed to say a\ngreat many more things to him, and to avenge myself for all his insults;\nbut if I had so much as opened my lips, my tears could no longer have\nbeen restrained, and I would have felt my dignity compromised before\nhim. I left the room, without a word. But scarcely was I beyond the\nsound of his footsteps when I was suddenly seized with terror at the\nthought of what we had done. It seemed to me horrible that, perhaps for\nlife, this bond, which constituted all my happiness, was destroyed, and\nmy impulse was to return at once. But would his passion have subsided\nsufficiently for him to comprehend me, if, without a word, I should hold\nout my hand to him, and look into his eyes? Would he comprehend my\ngenerosity? Suppose he should regard my sincere sorrow as dissimulation?\nOr should consider my voluntary right-doing as repentance, and receive\nme on that score? Or grant me pardon, with proud tranquillity? And why,\nwhen I have loved him so much, oh, _why_ should he have insulted me so?\n\nI did not go back to him, but into my own room, where I sat for a long\ntime, crying, recalling with terror every word of our conversation,\nmentally substituting other words for those we had used, adding\ndifferent and better ones, then reminding myself again, with a mingled\nsense of fright and outraged feeling, of all that had taken place. When\nI came down to tea, in the evening, and in the presence of C., who was\nmaking us a visit, met my husband again, I was aware that from this day\nforward there must be an open gulf between us. C. asked me when we were\ngoing to leave the city. I could not answer her.\n\n"On Tuesday," replied my husband, "we are staying for Countess R\'s\nreception. You are going, no doubt?" he continued, turning to me.\n\nI was frightened at the sound of his voice, although it seemed quite as\nusual, and glanced at my husband. His eyes were fixed on me, with a hard\nironical look, his tone was measured, cold.\n\n"Yes," I replied.\n\nLater, when we were alone, he approached me, and holding out his hand:\n\n"Forget, I entreat you, what I said to you."\n\nI took his hand, a faint smile came to my trembling lips, and the tears\nstarted to my eyes; but he quickly drew it away and, as if fearing a\nsentimental scene, went and sat down in an arm-chair at some distance\nfrom me. "Is it possible that he still believes himself right?" thought\nI; and I had on my lips a cordial explanation, and a request not to go\nto the reception.\n\n"I must write to mamma that we have postponed our departure," said he,\n"or she will be uneasy."\n\n"And when do you intend to leave?" I asked.\n\n"On the Tuesday after the reception."\n\n"I hope this is not on my account," said I, looking into his eyes, but\nthey only looked back into mine without telling me anything, as if they\nwere held far from me by some secret force. All at once, his face\nappeared to me old and disagreeable.\n\nWe went to the reception, and seemingly our relations were again cordial\nand affectionate, but in reality they were quite unlike what they had\nbeen in the past.\n\nAt the reception I was sitting in the midst of a circle of ladies, when\nthe prince approached me, so that I was obliged to stand up and speak\nto him. As I did so, my eyes involuntarily sought my husband; I saw him\nlook at me, from the other end of the room, and then turn away. Such a\nrush of shame and sorrow came over me, that I felt almost ill, and I\nknew that my face and neck grew scarlet under the eyes of the prince.\nBut I had to stand and listen to what he was saying to me, all the while\nfeeling him scrutinize me keenly from head to foot. Our conversation was\nnot long, there was not room near me for him to sit down, and he could\nnot help seeing how ill at ease I was with him. We talked of the last\nball, where I was to spend the summer, _etc._ Upon leaving me he\nexpressed a wish to make my husband\'s acquaintance, and in a little\nwhile I saw them meet, at the other end of the room, and begin to talk\nwith each other. The prince must have made some remark concerning me,\nfor I saw him smile and glance in my direction.\n\nMy husband\'s face flushed darkly, he bowed, and was the first to\nconclude the interview. I felt my color rise, also, for I was mortified\nto think what opinion the prince must have formed of me, and more\nespecially of Sergius. It seemed to me that every one must have observed\nmy embarrassment while I was talking with the prince, and also his very\nsingular manner; "God knows," said I to myself, "what interpretation may\nbe put upon it; could any one happen to know of my wrangle with my\nhusband?" My cousin took me home, and on the way we were talking about\nhim. I could not resist telling her all that had passed between us in\nregard to this unfortunate reception. She soothed me by assurances that\nit was only one of those frequent quarrels, which signify nothing at all\nand leave no result behind them; and in explaining my husband\'s\ncharacter from her point of view, she spoke of him as extremely reserved\nand proud. I agreed with her, and it seemed to me that, after this, I\ncomprehended his character more clearly and much more calmly.\n\nBut afterwards, when we were again alone together, this judgment of mine\nwith regard to him appeared to me a real crime, which weighed upon my\nconscience, and I felt that the gulf between us was widening more and\nmore.\n\nFrom this day on, our life and our mutual relations suffered a complete\nchange. Being alone together was no longer a delight to us. There were\nsubjects to be avoided, and it was easier for us to talk to each other\nin the presence of a third person. If in the course of conversation any\nallusion chanced to be made, either to life in the country, or to balls,\ndazzling wild-fire seemed to dance before our eyes and make us afraid to\nlook at each other; I knew that his embarrassment was as great as my\nown; we both realized how far asunder we were thrust by that dividing\ngulf, and dreaded drawing nearer. I was persuaded that he was passionate\nand proud, and that I must be very careful not to run against his weak\npoints. And, on his part, he was convinced that I could not exist\noutside of the life of the world, that a home in the country did not\nsuit me at all, and that he must resign himself to this unhappy\npredilection. Therefore we both shunned any direct conversation upon\nsuch subjects, and each erroneously judged the other. We had long\nceased to be respectively, in each other\'s eyes, the most perfect beings\nin this world; on the contrary, we were beginning to compare each other\nwith those around us, and to measure with secret appreciation our own\ncharacters.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\nI had been very unwell before we left St. Petersburg, and instead of\ngoing home we moved into a villa at a short distance from the city,\nwhere my husband left me while he went to see his mother. I was then\nquite well enough to accompany him, but he urged me not to do so,\nalleging as his reason my state of health. I quite understood that he\nwas not really afraid of my health, but he was possessed by the idea\nthat it would not be good for us to be in the country; I did not insist\nvery strenuously, and remained where I was. Without him I felt myself\ntruly in the midst of emptiness and isolation; but when he returned I\nperceived that his presence no longer added to my life what it had been\nwont to add. Those former relations, when any thought, any sensation,\nnot communicated to him, oppressed me like a crime; when all his\nactions, all his words, appeared to me models of perfection; when, from\nsheer joy, we would laugh at nothing, looking at each other; those\nrelations had so insensibly changed into something quite different, that\nwe ourselves hardly admitted the transformation. But the fact was that\neach of us had now separate occupations and interests, which we no\nlonger sought to share. We had even ceased to be at all troubled at thus\nliving in entirely distinct worlds, and entirely as strangers to each\nother. We had become habituated to this thought, and at the end of a\nyear there was no longer the mutual embarrassment when our eyes chanced\nto meet. His boyishness, his outbursts of light-hearted gaiety when with\nme, were gone; gone, too, was that indulgent indifference, against which\nI had so often risen in rebellion; nor had the penetrating look\nsurvived, which, in other days, had at once disturbed and delighted me;\nthere were no more of the prayers, no more of the hours of exaltation\nwhich we had so loved to share, and indeed we saw each other only very\nrarely; he was constantly out, and I no longer dreaded remaining alone,\nno longer complained of it; I was perpetually engrossed, on my side,\nwith the obligations of society, and never felt any need of him\nwhatever.\n\nScenes and altercations between us were quite unheard-of. I endeavored\nto satisfy him, he carried out all my wishes, any one would have said\nthat we still loved each other.\n\nWhen we were alone together, which was of rare occurrence, I felt\nneither joy, agitation, nor embarrassment, in his presence, any more\nthan if I had been alone. I knew well that here was no new-comer, no\nstranger, but on the contrary, a very excellent man, in short my\nhusband, whom I knew just as well as I knew myself. I was persuaded that\nI could tell beforehand all that he would do, all that he would think,\nprecisely what view he would take of any matter, and if he did or\nthought otherwise I only considered that he made a mistake; I never\nexpected anything at all from him. In one word, it was my husband, that\nwas all. It seemed to me that things were so, and had to be so; that no\nother relations between us could exist, or indeed ever had existed. When\nhe went away, especially at first, I still felt terribly lonely, and\nwhile he was absent I felt the full value of his support; when he came\nhome, I would even throw myself in his arms with joy; but scarcely had\ntwo hours elapsed ere I had forgotten this joy, and would find that I\nhad nothing to say to him. In these brief moments, when calm, temperate\ntenderness seemed to revive between us, it seemed to me that there never\nhad been anything but this; that this alone was what had once so\npowerfully stirred my heart, and I thought I read in his eyes the same\nimpression. I felt that to this tenderness there was a limit, which he\ndid not wish to pass, and neither did I. Sometimes this caused me a\nlittle regret, but I had no time to think about it seriously, and I\ntried to put it out of my mind, by giving myself up to a variety of\namusements of which I did not even render a clear account to myself, but\nwhich perpetually offered themselves to me. The life in the world,\nwhich, at first, had bewildered me with its splendor and the\ngratification it afforded to my self-love, had soon established entire\ndominion over my inclinations, and become at once a habit and a bondage,\noccupying in my soul that place which I had fancied would be the home of\nsentiment. Therefore I avoided being alone, dreading lest it might force\nme to look into and realize my condition. My whole time, from the\nearliest hour in the morning till the latest at night, was appropriated\nto something; even if I did not go out, there was no time that I left\nfree. I found in this life neither pleasure, nor weariness, and it\nseemed to me it had always been thus.\n\nIn this manner three years passed away, and our relations with each\nother remained the same, benumbed, congealed, motionless, as if no\nalteration could come to them, either for better or worse. During the\ncourse of these three years there were two important events in the\nfamily, but neither brought any change to my own life. These events were\nthe birth of my first child, and the death of Tatiana Semenovna. At\nfirst the maternal sentiment took possession of me with such power, so\ngreat and unexpected a rapture seized upon me, that I imagined a new\nexistence was beginning; but at the end of two months, when I commenced\nto go into society once more, this sentiment, which had been gradually\nsubsiding, had become nothing more than the habitual and cold\nperformance of a duty. My husband, on the contrary, from the day of this\nson\'s birth, had become his old self, gentle, calm, and home-loving,\nrecalling for his child, all his former tenderness and gaiety. Often\nwhen I went in my ball-dress into the child\'s nursery, to give him the\nevening benediction before starting and found my husband there, I would\ncatch a glance of reproach, or a severe and watchful look fixed upon me,\nand I would all at once feel ashamed. I was myself terrified at my\nindifference towards my own child, and I asked myself: "Can I be so much\nworse than other women?--But what is to be done?" I questioned. "Of\ncourse I love my son, but, for all that, I cannot sit down beside him\nfor whole days at a time, that would bore me to death; and as for making\na pretence, nothing in the world would induce me to do such a thing!"\n\nThe death of my husband\'s mother was a great grief to him; it was very\npainful to him, he said, to live after her at Nikolski, but though I\nalso regretted her and really sympathized with his sorrow, it would have\nbeen at that time more agreeable, more restful to me, to return and make\nour residence there. We had passed the greater part of these three years\nin the city; once only had I been at Nikolski, for a visit of two\nmonths; and during the third year we had been abroad.\n\nWe passed this summer at the baths.\n\nI was then twenty-one years of age. We were, I thought, prosperous; from\nmy home life I expected no more than it had already given me; all the\npeople whom I knew, it seemed to me, loved me; my health was excellent,\nI knew that I was pretty, my _toilettes_ were the freshest at the baths,\nthe weather was superb, an indefinable atmosphere of beauty and elegance\nsurrounded me, and everything appeared to me in the highest degree\ndelightful and joyous. Yet I was not, as light-hearted as I had been in\nthe old days at Nikolski, when I had felt that my happiness was within\nmyself, when I was happy because I deserved to be so, when my happiness\nwas great but might be greater still. Now all was different;\nnevertheless the summer was charming. I had nothing to desire, nothing\nto hope, nothing to fear; my life, as it seemed to me, was at its full,\nand my conscience, it also seemed to me, was entirely clear.\n\nAmong the men most conspicuous at the baths during this season, there\nwas not one whom, for any reason whatever, I preferred above the others,\nnot even old Prince K. our ambassador, who paid me distinguished\nattention. One was too young, another was too old, this one was an\nEnglishman with light curly hair, that one, a bearded Frenchman; I was\nperfectly indifferent to all, but, at the same time, all were\nindispensable to me. Insignificant as they might be, they yet belonged\nto, and formed a part of, this life of elegance surrounding me, this\natmosphere in which I breathed. However, there was one among them, an\nItalian, Marquis D. who, by the bold fashion in which he showed the\nadmiration he felt for me, had attracted my attention more than the\nothers. He allowed no occasion to escape him of meeting me, dancing with\nme, appearing on horseback beside me, accompanying me to the casino, and\nhe was constantly telling me how beautiful I was. From my window I\nsometimes saw him wandering around our house, and more than once the\nannoying persistence of the glances shot towards me from his flashing\neyes had made me blush and turn away.\n\nHe was young, handsome, elegant; and one remarkable thing about him was\nhis extraordinary resemblance to my husband, especially in his smile and\nsomething about the upper part of the face, though he was the handsomer\nman of the two. I was struck by the likeness, in spite of decided\ndifferences in some particulars, in the mouth for instance, the look,\nthe longer shape of the chin; and instead of the charm given to my\nhusband\'s face by his expression of kindness and ideal calmness, there\nwas in the other something gross and almost bestial. After a while I\ncould not help seeing that he was passionately in love with me; I\nsometimes found myself thinking of him with lofty pity. I undertook to\ntranquillize him, and bring him down to terms of cordial confidence and\nfriendship, but he repelled these attempts with trenchant disdain, and,\nto my great discomfiture, continued to show indications of a passion,\nsilent, indeed, as yet, but momentarily threatening to break forth.\nAlthough I would not acknowledge it to myself, I was afraid of this man,\nand seemed, against my own will, as it were, forced to think of him. My\nhusband had made his acquaintance, and was even more intimate with him\nthan with most of our circle, with whom he confined himself to being\nsimply the husband of his wife, and to whom his bearing was haughty and\ncold.\n\nTowards the end of the season I had a slight illness, which confined me\nto the house for two weeks. The first time I went out, after my\nrecovery, was to listen to the music in the evening, and I was at once\ntold of the arrival of Lady C. a noted beauty, who had been expected\nfor some time. A circle of friends quickly gathered around me, eagerly\nwelcoming me once more among them, but a yet larger circle was forming\nabout the new belle, and everybody near me was telling me about her and\nher beauty. She was pointed out to me; a beautiful and bewitching woman,\ntruly, but with an expression of confidence and self-sufficiency which\nimpressed me unpleasantly, and I said so. That evening, everything that\nusually seemed so bright and delightful was tiresome to me. The\nfollowing day Lady C. organized an expedition to the castle, which I\ndeclined. Hardly any one remained behind with me, and the aspect of\naffairs was decidedly changed to my eyes. All, men and things, seemed\nstupid and dull; I felt like crying, and resolved to complete my cure as\nsoon as possible and go home to Russia. At the bottom of my heart lurked\nbad, malevolent feelings, but I would not confess it to myself. I said\nthat I was not well, making that a pretext for giving up society. I very\nseldom went out, and then only in the morning, alone, to drink the\nwaters, or for a quiet walk or drive about the environs with L. M., one\nof my Russian acquaintances. My husband was absent at this time, having\ngone, some days before, to Heidelberg, to wait there until the end of my\nprescribed stay should allow our return to Russia, and he came to see me\nonly now and then.\n\nOne day Lady C. had carried off most of the company on some party of\npleasure, and after dinner L. M. and I made a little excursion to the\ncastle by ourselves. While our carriage was slowly following the winding\nroad between the double rows of chestnuts, centuries old, between whose\ngray trunks we saw in the distance the exquisite environs of Baden,\nlying in the purple light of the setting sun, we unconsciously fell into\na serious strain of conversation, which had never before been the case\nwith us. L. M., whom I had known so long, now for the first time\nappeared to me as a lovely intelligent woman, with whom one could\ndiscuss any topic whatever, and whose society was full of charm and\ninterest. We talked about family duties and pleasures, children, the\nvacuous life led in such places as we were now in, our desire to return\nto Russia, to the country, and we both fell into a grave, gentle mood,\nwhich was still upon us when we reached the castle. Within its broken\nwalls all was in deep shadow, cool and still, the summits of the towers\nwere yet in the sunlight, and the least sound of voice or footstep\nre-echoed among the arches. Through the doorway we saw the beautiful\nstretch of country surrounding Baden,--beautiful, yet to our Russian\neyes, cold and stern.\n\nWe sat down to rest, silently watching the sinking sun. Presently we\nheard voices, they grew more distinct, and I thought I caught my own\nname. I listened involuntarily, and heard a few words. I recognized the\nvoices; they were those of the Marquis D. and of a Frenchman, his\nfriend, whom I also knew. They were talking about me and Lady C. The\nFrenchman was comparing one with the other, and analyzing our beauty. He\nsaid nothing objectionable, yet I felt the blood rush to my heart as he\nspoke. He entered into detail as to what he found attractive in both\nLady C. and myself. As for me, I was already a mother, while Lady C. was\nbut nineteen years of age; my hair was more beautiful, but Lady C.\'s was\nmore gracefully arranged; Lady C. was more the high born dame "while\nyours," he said, alluding to me, "is one of the little princesses so\noften sent us by Russia." He concluded by saying that it was very\ndiscreet in me not to attempt to contest the field with Lady C., for, if\nI did, I most assuredly would find Baden my burial-place.\n\nThis cut me to the quick.\n\n"Unless she chose to console herself with you!" added the Frenchman with\na gay, cruel laugh.\n\n"If she goes, I shall follow," was the coarse reply of the voice with\nthe Italian accent.\n\n"Happy mortal! he can still love!" commented the other, mockingly.\n\n"Love!" the Italian was silent a moment, then went on. "I cannot help\nloving! Without love there is no life. To make of one\'s life a\nromance,--that is the only good. And my romances never break off in the\nmiddle; this one, like the others, I will carry out to the end."\n\n"Good luck, my friend!" said the Frenchman.\n\nI heard no more for the speakers seemed to turn the angle of the wall,\nand their steps receded on the other side. They descended the broken\nstairs, and in a few moments emerged from a side-door near us, showing\nmuch surprise at the sight of us. I felt my cheeks flame when Marquis D.\napproached me, and was confused and frightened at his offering me his\narm upon our leaving the castle. I could not refuse it, and following L.\nM. who led the way with his friend, we went down towards the carriage. I\nwas indignant at what the Frenchman had said of me, though I could not\nhelp secretly admitting that he had done nothing but put into language\nwhat I myself had already felt, but the words of the marquis had\nconfounded and revolted me by their grossness. I was tortured by the\nthought of having heard them, and at the same time I had suddenly lost\nall fear of him. I was disgusted at feeling him so near me; without\nlooking at him, without answering him, trying, though I still had his\narm, to keep so far from him that I could not hear his whispers, I\nwalked on quickly, close behind L. M. and the Frenchman. The marquis was\ntalking about the lovely view, the unexpected delight of meeting me, and\nI know not what besides, but I did not listen to him. The whole time I\nwas thinking about my husband, my son, Russia; divided feelings of shame\nand pity took hold of me, and I was possessed by a desire to hurry home,\nto shut myself up in my solitary room in the _Hotel de Bade_, where I\nmight be free to reflect upon all that seemed so suddenly to have risen\nup within my soul. But L. M. was walking rather slowly, the carriage was\nstill some distance away, and it seemed to me that my escort was\nobstinately slackening our pace, as if he meant to be left alone with\nme. "That shall not be!" I said to myself, quickening my steps. But he\nundisguisedly kept me back, holding my arm with a close pressure; at\nthis moment L. M. turned a corner of the road, and we were left alone.\nI was seized with alarm.\n\n"Excuse me," said I coldly, drawing my arm out of his, but the lace\ncaught on one of his buttons. He stooped towards me to disengage it, and\nhis ungloved fingers rested on my arm. A new sensation--not fright,\ncertainly not pleasure--sent a chill shiver through me. I looked up at\nhim, meaning my glance to express all the cold contempt I felt for him;\nbut instead of this, he seemed to read in it only agitation and alarm.\nHis ardent, humid eyes were fixed passionately upon me, his hands\ngrasped my wrists, his half-open lips were murmuring to me, telling me\nthat he loved me, that I was everything to him, his hold upon me growing\nstronger and closer with every word. I felt fire in my veins, my vision\nwas obscured, I trembled from head to foot, and the words I tried to\nutter died away in my throat. Suddenly I felt a kiss upon my cheek; I\nshivered, and looked into his face again, powerless to speak or stir,\nexpecting and wishing I knew not what.\n\nIt was only an instant. But this instant was terrible! In it I saw him\nas he was, I analyzed his face at a glance: low brow, straight correct\nnose with swelling nostrils, fine beard and mustache waxed and pointed,\ncheeks carefully shaven, brown neck. I hated him, I feared him, he was a\nstranger to me; nevertheless, at this moment, how powerfully the emotion\nand passion of this detestable man, this stranger, was re-echoing within\nme!\n\n"I love you!" was the murmur of the voice so like my husband\'s. My\nhusband and my child,--hurriedly my mind flashed to them, as beings\ndearly loved, once existent, now gone, lost, done with. But suddenly\nfrom around the turn of the road I heard L. M.\'s voice calling me. I\nrecovered myself, snatched away my hands without looking at him, and\nalmost flew to rejoin her. Not until we were in the caleche did I glance\nback at him. He took off his hat, and said something to me--I know not\nwhat--smiling. He little knew what inexpressible torture he made me\nendure at that moment.\n\nLife appeared so miserable, the future so desperate, the past so\nsombre! L. M. talked to me, but I did not understand one word she was\nsaying. It seemed as though she was only talking to me from compassion,\nand to hide the contempt she felt. I thought I read this contempt, this\ninsulting compassion in every word, every glance. That kiss was burning\ninto my cheek with cutting shame, and to think of my husband and child\nwas insupportable to me. Once alone in my chamber, I hoped to be able to\nmeditate upon my situation, but I found it was frightful to remain\nalone. I could not drink the tea that was brought me, and without\nknowing why, hurriedly I decided to take the evening train for\nHeidelberg, to rejoin my husband. When I was seated with my maid in the\nempty compartment, when the train was at last in motion, and I breathed\nthe fresh air rushing in through the empty windows, I began to be myself\nagain, and to think with some degree of clearness over my past and my\nfuture. All my married life, from the day of our departure for St.\nPetersburg, lay before me in a new light, that of awakened and accusing\nconscience.\n\nFor the first time, I vividly recalled the commencement of my life in\nthe country, my plans; for the first time, the thought came to my mind:\nhow happy he was then! And I suddenly felt guilty towards him. "But\nthen, why not check me, why dissimulate before me, why avoid all\nexplanation, why insult me?" I asked myself. "Why not use the power of\nhis love? But perhaps he no longer loved me?"--Yet, whether he was to\nblame or not, here was this on my cheek, this kiss which I still felt.\nThe nearer I came to Heidelberg, and the more clearly my husband\'s image\npresented itself, the more terrible became the imminent meeting with\nhim. "I will tell him all, all; my eyes will be blinded with tears of\nrepentance," thought I, "and he will forgive me." But I did not myself\nknow what was this "all" that I was going to tell him, nor was I\nabsolutely sure that he would forgive me. In fact, when I entered his\nroom and saw his face, so tranquil despite its surprise, I felt no\nlonger able to tell him anything, to confess anything, to entreat his\nforgiveness for anything. An unspeakable sorrow and deep repentance were\nweighing me down.\n\n"What were you thinking of?" he said: "I intended joining you at Baden\nto-morrow." But a second glance at me seemed to startle him. "Is\nanything wrong? What is the matter with you?" he exclaimed.\n\n"Nothing," I replied, keeping back my tears. "I have come away ... I am\nnot going back ... Let us go--to-morrow if we can--home to Russia!"\n\nHe was silent for some time, watching me narrowly.\n\n"Come, tell me what has occurred," he said, at length.\n\nI felt my face grow scarlet, and my eyes sank. His were glittering with\nan indefinable foreboding, and hot anger. I dreaded the thoughts which\nmight be assailing him, and, with a power of dissimulation of which I\ncould not have believed myself capable, I made haste to answer:\n\n"Nothing has occurred,--but I was overwhelmed by weariness and\ndejection; I was alone, I began to think of you, and of our life. How\nlong I have been to blame towards you! After this, you may take me with\nyou wherever you wish! Yes, I have long been to blame," I repeated, and\nmy tears began to fall fast. "Let us go back to the country," I cried,\n"and forever!"\n\n"Ah! my love, spare me these sentimental scenes," said he, coldly; "for\nyou to go to the country will be all very well, just now, for we are\nrunning a little short of money; but as for its being \'forever,\' that is\nbut a notion: I know you could not stay there long! Come, drink a cup of\ntea,--that is the best thing to do," he concluded, rising to call a\nservant.\n\nI could not help imagining what his thoughts of me doubtless were, and I\nfelt indignant at the frightful ideas which I attributed to him as I met\nthe look of shame and vigilant suspicion which he bent upon me. No, he\nwill not, and he cannot comprehend me!... I told him that I was going\nto see the child, and left him. I longed to be alone, and free to weep,\nweep, weep....\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n\nOur house at Nikolski, so long cold and deserted, came to life again;\nbut the thing which did not come to life was our old existence. Mamma\nwas there no longer, and henceforth we were alone, we two alone with\neach other. But not only was solitude no longer to us what it had once\nbeen, but we found it a burden and constraint. The winter passed all the\nmore drearily for me from my being out of health, and it was not until\nsome time after the birth of my second son that I recovered my strength.\n\nMy relations with my husband continued cold and friendly, as at St.\nPetersburg; but here in the country there was not a floor, not a wall,\nnot a piece of furniture, which did not remind me of what he had been\nto me, and what I had lost. There stood between us, as it were, an\noffence not forgiven; one would have said that he wished to punish me\nfor something, and that he was pretending to himself to be unconscious\nof it. How could I ask forgiveness without knowing for what fault? He\nonly punished me by no longer entirely giving himself up to me, by no\nlonger surrendering to me his whole soul; but to no one, and under no\ncircumstances, was his soul surrendered, any more than if he had none.\nIt sometimes came into my head that he was only making a pretence of\nbeing what he now was, in order to torment me, and that his feelings\nwere in reality what they had formerly been, and I tried to provoke him\ninto letting this be seen; but he invariably eluded all frank\nexplanation; one would have said that he suspected me of dissimulation,\nand dreaded all manifestations of tenderness as attempts to ridicule\nhim. His looks and his air seemed to say: "I know all, there is nothing\nto tell me; all that you would confide to me, I already know; I know\nthat you talk in one manner and act in another." At first I was hurt by\nhis apparent fear of being frank with me, but I soon accustomed myself\nto the thought that in him this was not so much lack of frankness, as\nlack of necessity for frankness.\n\nAnd on my side, my tongue was no longer capable of telling him\nimpulsively, as in the old days, that I loved him, of asking him to read\nthe prayers with me, of calling him to listen to my music when I was\ngoing to play; there seemed to be certain rules of formality tacitly\ndecreed between us. We lived our own lives; he, with his various\ninterests and occupations, in which I no longer claimed nor desired a\nshare; I, with my idle hours, about which he no longer seemed to trouble\nhimself. As for the children, they were still too young to be in any way\na bond between us.\n\nSpring came. Macha and Sonia returned to the country for the summer; and\nas Nikolski was undergoing repairs, we went with them to Pokrovski. The\nsame old home, the terrace, the out-of-door tea-table, the piano in the\nhalf-lighted room, my own old chamber with its white curtains, and the\ngirlish dreams which seemed to have been left behind there, forgotten.\nIn this chamber were two beds; over one, which had been my own, I now\nbent nightly to bless my sturdy Kokocha,[H] in the midst of his bedtime\nfrolics; in the other lay little Vasica,[I] his baby-face rosy with\nsleep, under the soft white blankets. After giving the benediction, I\noften lingered a long time in this peaceful chamber, and from every\ncorner of its walls, from every fold of its curtains, came stealing\naround me forgotten visions of my youth; childish songs, gay choruses,\nfloated again to my ears. And what were they now,--these visions? Were\nthey sounding still, anywhere,--these glad and sweet old songs? All that\nI had hardly dared to hope had come true. My vague and confused dreams\nhad become reality, and it was now my life, so hard, so heavy, so\nstripped of joy. And yet here around me were not all things as before?\nWas it not the same garden that I saw beneath my window, the same\nterrace, the same paths and benches? Far off there, across the ravine,\nthe songs of the nightingales still seemed to rise out of the ripples of\nthe little pond, the lilacs bloomed as they used to do, the moon still\nstood in white glory over the corner of the house, yet for me all was so\nchanged, so changed! Macha and I had our old quiet talks, sitting\ntogether as of old in the salon, and we still talked of him. But Macha\'s\nbrow was grave, her face was wan, her eyes no longer shone with\ncontentment and hope, but were full of sad sympathy, and almost\nexpressed compassion. We no longer went into ecstasies over him, as in\nthe past; we judged him, now; we no longer marvelled at our great\nhappiness and wondered how it came to be ours, we no longer had the\nimpulse to tell all the world what we felt; we whispered in each other\'s\near like conspirators; for the hundredth time we asked each other why\nall was so sad, so changed. As for him, he was still the same, except\nthat the line between his brows was deeper, and his temples were more\nsilvery, and his eyes, watchful, deep, continually turned away from me,\nwere darkened by a shadow. I, too, was still the same, but I no longer\nfelt either love or desire to love. No more wish to work, no more\nsatisfaction with myself. And how far off, how impossible, now appeared\nmy old religious fervor, my old love for him, my old fulness of life! I\ncould not, now, even comprehend what in those days was so luminous and\nso true: the happiness of living for others. Why for others? when I no\nlonger wished to live for myself....\n\nI had entirely given up my music during our residence in St. Petersburg,\nbut now my old piano and my old pieces brought back the love for it.\n\nOne day when I was not feeling well, I stayed at home, alone, while\nMacha and Sonia went with my husband to see the improvements at\nNikolski. The tea-table was set, I went down-stairs, and, while waiting\nfor them, seated myself at the piano. I opened the sonata _Quasi una\nfantasia_, and began to play. No living creature was to be seen or\nheard, the windows were open upon the garden; the familiar notes, so\nsad and penetrating, resounded through the room. I concluded the first\npart, and unconsciously, simply from old habit, I looked across to the\ncorner where he used to sit and listen to me. But he was no longer\nthere, a long-unmoved chair occupied his old place; from the side of the\nopen window a projecting branch of lilac stood out against the burning\nwest, the evening air stole quietly in. I leaned my elbows on the piano,\ncovered my face with both hands, and fell into a fit of musing. I\nremained there a long time, mournfully recalling the old days,\nirrevocably gone, and timidly looking at the days to come. But\nhereafter, it seemed to me, there could be nothing, I could hope\nnothing, desire nothing. "Is it possible that I have outlived all that!"\nthought I, raising my head with horror, and in order to forget and to\ncease thinking, I began to play again, and still the same old _andante_.\n"My God!" I said, "pardon me if I am guilty, or give back to my soul\nwhat made its beauty ... or teach me what I ought to do,--how I ought to\nlive!"\n\nThe sound of wheels echoed on the turf and before the door, then I heard\non the terrace steady steps, well-known to me, then all was quiet. But\nit was no longer the old feeling which stirred in me at these familiar\nfootsteps. They came up behind me when I had finished the sonata, and a\nhand was laid upon my shoulder.\n\n"A happy thought, to play the old sonata!" he said.\n\nI made no answer.\n\n"Have not you had tea?"\n\nI shook my head, without turning towards him, for I did not want him to\nsee the traces of agitation on my face.\n\n"They will be here presently; the horses were a little unruly, and they\nare coming home on foot, by the road," he continued.\n\n"We will wait for them," I said, going out on the terrace, in the hope\nthat he would follow, but he inquired for the children, and went up to\nsee them. Once more, his presence, the sound of his voice, so kind, so\nhonest, dissuaded me from believing that all was lost for me. "What\nmore is there to desire?" I thought: "he is good and true, he is an\nexcellent husband, an excellent father, and I do not myself know what is\nmissing,--what I want."\n\nI went out on the balcony, and sat down under the awning of the terrace,\non the same bench where I was sitting upon the day of our decisive\nexplanation long ago. The sun was nearly down, dusk was gathering; a\nshade of spring softened the pure sky, where one tiny spark was already\ngleaming. The light wind had died away, not a leaf or blade of grass\nstirred; the perfume of the lilacs and cherry-trees, so powerful that\none might have thought all the air itself was in bloom, came in puffs\nover garden and terrace, now faint and now full, making one feel an\nimpulse to close the eyes, to shut out all sight and sound, to banish\nevery sensation save that of inhaling this exquisite fragrance. The\ndahlias and rose-bushes, yet leafless, stood in still lines in the\nnewly-dug black mould of their beds, lifting their heads above their\nwhite props. From afar came the intermittent notes of the nightingales,\nor the rush of their restless flight from place to place.\n\nIt was in vain that I strove to calm myself, I seemed to be waiting and\nwishing for something.\n\nSergius came from up-stairs, and sat down beside me.\n\n"I believe it is going to rain," he said, "they will get wet."\n\n"Yes," I replied; and we were both silent.\n\nIn the meantime, the cloud, without any wind, had crept slowly and\nstealthily above our heads; nature was yet more perfectly tranquil,\nsweet, and still: suddenly one drop fell, and, so to speak, rebounded,\nupon the linen of the awning, another rolled, a growing ball of dust,\nalong the path; then, with a sound like deadened hail, came the heavy\ndash of rain, gathering force every moment. At once, as if by concert,\nfrogs and nightingales were silent; but the light plash of the fountain\nwas still heard beneath the beating of the rain, and far off in the\ndistance some little bird, no doubt safe and dry under a sheltering\nbough, chirped in monotonous rhythm his two recurring notes. Sergius\nrose to go into the house.\n\n"Where are you going?" said I, stopping him. "It is so delightful here!"\n\n"I must send an umbrella and some overshoes."\n\n"It is not necessary, this will be over directly."\n\nHe assented, and we remained standing together by the balustrade of the\nbalcony. I put my hand on the wet slippery rail, and leaned forward into\nthe rain, the cool drops falling lightly on my hair and neck. The cloud,\nbrightening and thinning, scattered in shining spray above us, the\nregular beat of the shower was succeeded by the sound of heavy drops\nfalling more and more rarely from the sky or from the trees. The frogs\nresumed their croaking, the nightingales shook their wings and began\nagain to respond to each other from behind the glistening shrubs, now on\none side, now on another. All was serene again before us.\n\n"How good it is to live!" he said, leaning over the balustrade and\npassing his hand over my wet hair.\n\nThis simple caress acted on me like a reproach, and I longed to let my\ntears flow.\n\n"What more can a man need?" continued he. "I am at this moment so\ncontent, that I feel nothing wanting, and I am completely happy!"\n\n("You did not speak so to me when to hear it would have made my\nhappiness," I thought. "However great yours was, then, you used to say\nthat you wished for more of it, still more. And now you are calm and\ncontent, when my soul is full of inexpressible repentance and\nunsatisfied tears!")\n\n"To me, too, life is good," said I, "and it is precisely because it is\nso good to me, that I am sad. I feel so detached, so incomplete; I am\nalways wanting some other thing, and yet everything here is so good, so\ntranquil! Can it be possible that for you no sorrow ever seems mingled\nwith your pleasure in life?--as if, for instance, you were feeling\nregret for something in the past?"\n\nHe drew away the hand resting on my head, and was silent for a moment.\n\n"Yes, that has been the case with me, formerly, particularly in the\nspring," he said, as if searching his memory. "Yes, I also have spent\nwhole nights in longings and fears,--and what beautiful nights they\nwere!... But then all was before me, and now all is behind; now I am\ncontent with what is, and that to me is perfection," he concluded, with\nsuch easy frankness of manner, that, painful as it was to hear, I was\nconvinced that it was the truth.\n\n"Then you desire nothing more?" I questioned.\n\n"Nothing impossible," he replied, divining my thought. "How wet you have\nmade your head," he went on, caressing me like a child, and passing his\nhand again over my hair; "you are jealous of the leaves and grass which\nthe rain was falling on; you would like to be the grass and the leaves\nand the rain; while I--I enjoy simply seeing them, as I do seeing\nwhatever is good, young, happy."\n\n"And you regret nothing in the past?" I persisted, with the dull weight\non my heart growing heavier and heavier.\n\nHe seemed to muse for a moment, keeping silent. I saw that he wished to\nanswer honestly.\n\n"No!" he said, at length, briefly.\n\n"That is not true! that is not true!" I cried, turning and facing him,\nwith my eyes fixed upon his. "You do not regret the past?"\n\n"No!" he repeated. "I bless it, but I do not regret it."\n\n"And you would not wish to go back to it?"\n\nHe turned away, looking out over the garden.\n\n"I no more wish that than I would wish to have wings. It cannot be."\n\n"And you would not re-make this past? And you reproach neither yourself,\nnor me?"\n\n"Never! all has been for the best."\n\n"Listen!" said I, seizing his hand to force him to turn towards me.\n"Listen! Why did you never tell me what you wished from me, that I might\nhave lived exactly as you desired? Why did you give me a liberty which\nI knew not how to use? why did you cease to teach me? If you had wished\nit, if you had cared to guide me differently, nothing, nothing would\nhave happened," I went on, in a voice which more and more energetically\nexpressed anger and reproach, with none of the former love.\n\n"What is it that would not have happened?" said he with surprise,\nturning towards me. "There has been nothing. All is well, very well," he\nrepeated smiling.\n\n"Can it be possible," I thought, that he does not understand me? "or,\nworse still, that he will not understand me?" and my tears began to\nfall.\n\n"This would have happened,--that, not having made me guilty towards you,\nyou would not have punished me by your indifference, your contempt," I\nbroke out. "What would _not_ have happened is seeing myself, with no\nfault on my own part, suddenly robbed by you of all that was dear to\nme."\n\n"What are you saying, my darling?" he exclaimed, as if he had not\nunderstood my words.\n\n"No, let me finish! You have robbed me of your confidence, your love,\neven of your esteem, and this because I ceased to believe that you still\nloved me after what had taken place! No," I went on, checking him again\nas he was about to interrupt me, "for once I must speak out all that has\nbeen torturing me so long! Was I to blame because I did not know life,\nand because you left me to find it out for myself?... And am I to blame\nthat now,--when at last I comprehend, of myself, what is necessary in\nlife; now, when for more than a year I have been making a struggle to\nreturn to you,--you constantly repulse me, constantly pretend not to\nknow what I want? and things are so arranged that there is never\nanything for you to reproach yourself with, while I am left to be\nmiserable and guilty? Yes, you would cast me back again into that life\nwhich must make wretchedness for me and for you!"\n\n"And how am I doing that?" he asked, with sincere surprise and alarm.\n\n"Did not you tell me yesterday,--yes, you tell me so perpetually,--that\nthe life here does not suit me, and that we must go to St. Petersburg\nagain for the winter? Instead of supporting me," I continued, "you avoid\nall frankness with me, any talk that is sweet, and real. And then if I\nfall, you will reproach me with it, or you will make light of it!"\n\n"Stop, stop," he said severely and coldly; "what you are saying is not\nright. It only shows that you are badly disposed towards me, that you do\nnot...."\n\n"That I do not love you! say it! say it, then!" I exclaimed, blind with\nmy tears. I sat down on the bench, and covered my face with my\nhandkerchief.\n\n"That is the way he understands me!" I thought, trying to control my\nchoking sobs. "It is all over with our old love!" said the voice in my\nheart. He did not come near me, and made no attempt to console me. He\nwas wounded by what I had said. His voice was calm and dry, as he began:\n\n"I do not know what you have to reproach me with, except that I do not\nlove you as I used to do!"\n\n"As you used to love me!..." I murmured under my handkerchief, drenching\nit with bitter tears.\n\n"And for that, time and ourselves are equally guilty. For each period\nthere is one suitable phase of love...."\n\nHe was silent.\n\n"And shall I tell you the whole truth, since you desire frankness? Just\nas, during that first year of our acquaintance, I spent night after\nnight without sleep, thinking of you and building up my own love, until\nit grew to fill all my heart, so in St. Petersburg and while we were\nabroad I spent fearful nights in striving to break down and destroy this\nlove which was my torment. I could not destroy it, but I did at least\ndestroy the element which had tormented me; I became tranquil, and yet I\ncontinued to love you,--but it was with another love."\n\n"And you call _that_ love, when it was nothing but a punishment!" I\nreplied. "Why did you let me live in the world, if it appeared to you\nso pernicious that because of it you would cease to love me?"\n\n"It was not the world, my dear, that was the guilty one."\n\n"Why did you not use your power? Why did you not strangle me? Murder me?\nThat would have been better for me to-day than to have lost all that\nmade my happiness,--it would have been better for me, and at least there\nwould not have been the shame!"\n\nI began to sob again, and I covered my face.\n\nJust at that moment Macha and Sonia, wet and merry, ran up on the\nterrace, laughing and talking; but at the sight of us their voices were\nhushed, and they hurried into the house.\n\nWe remained where we were, for a long time, silent; after they were\ngone, I sobbed on until my tears were exhausted and I felt somewhat\ncalmer. I looked at him. He was sitting with his head resting on his\nhand, and appeared to wish to say something to me in response to my\nglance, but he only gave a heavy sigh and put his head down again.\n\nI went to him and drew his hand away. He turned then, and looked at me\nthoughtfully.\n\n"Yes," he said, as if pursuing his own thoughts, "for all of us, and\nparticularly for you women, it is necessary that we should ourselves\nlift to our own lips the cup of the vanities of life, before we can\ntaste life itself; no one believes the experience of others. You had\nnot, at that time, dipped very deep into the science of those entrancing\nand seducing vanities. Therefore I allowed you to plunge for a moment; I\nhad no right to forbid it, simply because my own hour for it was long\nsince over."\n\n"Why did you let me live among these vanities, if you loved me?"\n\n"Because you would not--nay, more, you could not--have believed me about\nthem; it was necessary for you to learn for yourself; and you have\nlearned."\n\n"You reasoned a great deal," said I. "That was because you loved me so\nlittle."\n\nWe were silent again.\n\n"What you have just said to me is hard, but it is the truth," he\nresumed, after a while, rising abruptly, and beginning to walk about the\nterrace; "yes, it is the truth! I have been to blame," he went on,\nstopping before me.... "Either I ought not to have let myself love you\nat all, or I ought to have loved you more simply--yes!"\n\n"Sergius, let us forget everything," said I, timidly.\n\n"No, what is gone never comes again, there can be no turning back ..."\nhis voice softened as he spoke.\n\n"It has already come again," said I, laying my hand on his shoulder.\n\nHe took the hand in his, and pressed it.\n\n"No, I was not telling the truth, when I pretended not to regret the\npast; no, I do regret your past love; I bitterly mourn over it,--this\nlove, which can no longer exist. Who is to blame? I do not know. Love\nthere may even yet be, but not the same; its place is still there, but\ndarkened and desolated; it is without savor and without strength; the\nremembrance has not vanished, nor the gratitude, but...."\n\n"Do not speak so," I interrupted. "Let it come to life again, let it be\nwhat it was.... Might that be?" I asked, looking into his face. His eyes\nwere serene, quiet, and met mine without their old deep look.\n\nEven as I asked the question I felt the answer, felt that my wish was no\nlonger possible to realize. He smiled; it seemed to me an old man\'s\nsmile, gentle and full of peace.\n\n"How young you still are, and how old I am already!" he said. "Why\ndelude ourselves?" he added, still with the same smile.\n\nI remained near him, silent, and feeling my soul grow more and more\ntranquil.\n\n"Do not let us try to repeat life," he went on, "nor to lie to\nourselves. But it is something, to have no longer, God willing, either\ndisquiet or distress. We have nothing to seek for. We have already\nfound, already shared, happiness enough. All we have to do now is to\nopen the way,--you see to whom...." he said, pointing out little Vania,\nin his nurse\'s arms, at the terrace door. "That is necessary, dear\nlove," he concluded, bending over me and dropping a kiss on my hair.\n\nIt was no longer a lover, it was an old friend who gave the caress.\n\nThe perfumed freshness of night was rising, sweeter and stronger, from\nthe garden; the few sounds audible were solemn and far off, and soon\ngave way to deep tranquillity; one by one the stars shone out. I looked\nat him, and all at once I became conscious of infinite relief in my\nsoul; it was as if a moral nerve, whose sensitiveness had caused me keen\nsuffering had suddenly been removed. Quietly and clearly I comprehended\nthat the dominant sentiment of this phase of my existence was\nirrevocably gone, as was the phase itself, and that not only was its\nreturn impossible, but that it would be to me full of unendurable pain.\nThere had been enough of this time; and had it indeed been so\ngood,--this time, which to me had seemed to enclose such joys? And\nalready it had lasted so long, so long!\n\n"But tea is waiting," he said, gently; and we went together to the\ndrawing-room.\n\nAt the door I met Macha, and the nurse with Vania. I took the child in\nmy arms, wrapped up the little bare feet, and, holding it close to my\nheart, barely touched its lips with a light kiss. Almost asleep as it\nwas, it moved its little arms, stretched out the crumpled fingers, and\nopened its bewildered eyes, as if trying to find or remember something;\nall at once its eyes fell on me, a look of intelligence sparkled in\nthem, and the pink pursed-up lips lengthened in a baby smile. "You are\nmine, mine!" thought I, with a delicious thrill running through me, and\nas I strained it to my heart I was half afraid of hurting it with my\neager embrace. Over and over I kissed its cold little feet, its breast,\nits arms, and head with the scant covering of down. My husband came up\nto us, quickly drew the wrapping over the baby\'s face, then, drawing it\naway again:\n\n"Ivan Sergevitch!" he said with finger under the little chin.\n\nBut I, in my turn, covered up Ivan Sergevitch. No one should look at\nhim so long, except myself. I glanced at my husband, his eyes laughed as\nthey rested on mine, and it was long since I had met his with such happy\njoy.\n\nThis day ended my romance with my husband. The old love remained, and\nthe dear remembrance of what could never come back to me; but a new love\nfor my children and my children\'s father, began another life and another\nway of happiness, up to this hour unending ... for at last I know that\nin home, and in the pure joys of home will be found--real happiness!\n\nTHE END.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n     =WAR AND PEACE.= A Historical Novel, by Count Leon Tolstoi,\n     translated into French by a Russian Lady and from the French by\n     Clara Bell. _Authorized Edition._ Complete, Three Parts in Box.\n     Paper, $3.00.

It is a story of the\nfamily rather than of the field, and is charming in its delineations of\nquaint Russian customs. It is a novel of absorbing interest, full of\naction and with a well managed plot; a book well worth\nreading."--_Philadelphia Enquirer._\n\n"The story of \'War and Peace\' ranks as the greatest of Slavic historical\nnovels. It is intensely dramatic in places and the battle scenes are\nmarvels of picturesque description. At other points the vein is quiet\nand philosophical, and the reader is held by the soothing charm that is\nin complete contrast with the action and energy of battle."--_Observer,\nUtica, N.Y._\n\n"War and Peace is a historical novel and is extremely interesting, not\nonly in its description of the times of the great invasion eighty years\nago, but in its vivid pictures of life and character in\nRussia."--_Journal of Commerce, New York._\n\n"On general principles the historical novel is neither valuable as fact\nnor entertaining as fiction. But \'War and Peace\' is a striking exception\nto this rule. It deals with the most impressive and dramatic period of\nEuropean history. It reproduces a living panorama of scene, and actors,\nand circumstance idealized into the intense and artistic life of\nimaginative composition, and written with a brilliancy of style and\nepigrammatic play of thought, a depth of significance, that render the\nstory one of the most fascinating and absorbing."--_Boston Evening\nTraveller._\n\n_Wm.

One vol. Paper, 50\n     cts. Cloth binding. $1.00.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n"The Cossacks" forms the culmination of the period in which he\nphotographed with miraculous realism and no definite purpose, detached\npictures of life and studies of the affections, and the period in which\nhe began to see and suggest the spiritual meaning of and the chain of\nultimate purpose binding together the panorama of human existence. The\nbook is an idyl of semi-barbarous life and yet the hero begins to\nstruggle with the problems that puzzled Sergius, that Levin half solved,\nand from which Tolstoi himself escapes in a Quaker creed.\n\nOlenin is a young Russian noble whose career has simulated outwardly\nthat of his companions, but whose soul has been unsatisfied and empty,\ndriving him finally to break away from his old associations and go for a\ncampaign in the Caucasus. With that campaign the story does not concern\nitself, going on to its conclusion when the young man settles down in a\nCossack village to wait for his promotion. This portion of the book is\ninimitable for the slight, almost imperceptible touches through which\nTolstoi has the power, greater than that of any one else, of reproducing\nthe actual scene he wishes to transcribe. This power can scarcely be\ncalled realism. It might be better characterized as realization. It is\npossible in this way to know the exact life of this brave, indolent,\ngood-tempered, healthful race of half-Russians, half-Circassians, and to\nfeel the charm they possessed for Olenin. It is a curious fact that the\nmost civilized natures are most akin to barbarism. The simple directness\nof barbaric virtues, the healthy passion and aggressiveness of its vices\nmake the process of atavism easy to a nature that has risen above the\nmere materialism of civilization. The process of this reversion in\nOlenin is hastened, of course, by love for a Cossack woman, one of those\nclean-minded girls who think no harm in a kiss or caress, but whose\nvirtue is an absolute and natural thing that admits of no question or\ndiscussion. His love is not of the kind that could mean her dishonor,\nand he asks for Marianka\'s hand in marriage, feeling helplessly and\nhopelessly all the while that real union is impossible between\nthem--that though he can understand her and go down into her\nsemi-barbarism, she can never know him or appreciate the motives that\nimpel him to leave a state that she considers higher than her own. The\nstory ends abruptly and what is called by the professional novel-reader\n"unsatisfactorily." Marianka clings in preference to her Cossack lover,\nand Olenin feeling despairingly that this rude, simple, barbarous life\ncan never absorb, can only encyst him, goes rack to his duties at the\nfront.--_New York World._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n                                  THE\n\n                             EBERS GALLERY\n\n                       A COLLECTION OF PAINTINGS\n\n                            ILLUSTRATING THE\n\n                        ROMANCES OF GEORG EBERS\n\n                        BY THE FOLLOWING ARTISTS\n\n         L.

Price, paper\n     covers, $1.00, cloth binding, $1.75 per set.\n\n"This romance has much value, apart from its interest as a narrative.\nThe learned author, who has made the Land of the Nile an object of\nspecial study and research, throws a clear, steady light on one of those\ncomplicated periods of history when nationality seems submerged in the\nconflicting interests of sects and factions. The history of Egypt\ntowards the middle of the seventh century, A. D., forms a sort of\nhistorical whirlpool. The tide of Moslem invasion and the\ncounter-current of patriotism were temporarily swayed by the\nintermingling currents of sectarianism, ecclesiasticism and individual\nself-interest.\n\n"All the leading characters are typical of these contending forces, and\nalso display an unreasoning impulsiveness in both love and hatred,\ncharacteristic of a tropical clime.\n\n"The Egyptian heathen, the Egyptian Christian, the Greek Christian, the\nMoslem and Ethiopian show the feelings peculiar to their political\nconditions by word and act, thus making their relationship to one\nanother very distinct, and though not an historical study, at least a\nstudy of the probabilities of that epoch. It is also a reliable picture\nof the manners, customs and civilization of a period less generally\nknown than those remote, and consequently more attractive periods of the\nbuilding of the pyramids, and of the Pharoahs.\n\n"The portrayal of individual character and arrangement of incidents are\nnecessarily secondary to the higher aims of this entertaining and\ninstructive romance. It is only towards the end of the second volume\nthat the significance of the title becomes apparent. The \'Bride\' was a\nGreek Christian doomed by the superstitious authorities to be drowned in\nthe Nile as a sacrifice to appease the anger of the creative powers,\nsupposed to be withholding the usual overflow of its waters. She escaped\nher watery fate, and her rival, an unprincipled heiress, became a\nvoluntary sacrifice through vanity and despair. This author has already\nwon much renown by previous romances founded on interesting epochs of\nEgyptian history."--_Daily Alta, California._\n\n_William S.

Price, paper covers,\n     $1.00. Cloth binding, $1.75.\n\n"There must always be some difference of opinion concerning the right of\nthe romancer to treat of sacred events and to introduce sacred\npersonages into his story. Some hold that any attempt to embody an idea\nof our Saviour\'s character, experiences, sayings and teachings in the\nform of fiction must have the effect of lowering our imaginative ideal,\nand rendering trivial and common-place that which in the real Gospel is\nspontaneous, inspired and sublime. But to others an historical novel\nlike the \'Martyr of Golgotha\' comes like a revelation, opening fresh\nvistas of thought, filling out blanks and making clear what had hitherto\nbeen vague and unsatisfactory, quickening insight and sympathy, and\nactually heightening the conception of divine traits. The author gives\nalso a wide survey of the general history of the epoch and shows the\nvarious shaping causes which were influencing the rise and development\nof the new religion in Palestine. There is, indeed, an astonishing\nvitality and movement throughout the work, and, elaborate though the\nplot is, with all varieties and all contrasts of people and conditions,\nwith constant shiftings of the scene, the story yet moves, and moves the\ninterest of the reader too, along the rapid current of events towards\nthe powerful culmination. The writer uses the Catholic traditions, and\nin many points interprets the story in a way which differs altogether\nfrom that familiar to Protestants: for example, making Mary Magdalen the\nsame Mary who was the sister of Lazarus and Martha, and who sat\nlistening at the Saviour\'s feet. But in general, although there is a\nfree use made of Catholic legends and traditions, their effort is\nnatural and pleasing. The romance shows a degree of a southern fervor\nwhich is foreign to English habit, but the flowery, poetic\nstyle--although it at first repels the reader--is so individual, so much\na part of the author, that it is soon accepted as the naive expression\nof a mind kindled and carried away by its subject. Spanish literature\nhas of late given us a variety of novels and romances, all of which are\nin their way so good that we must believe that there is a new generation\nof writers in Spain who are discarding the worn-out forms and\ntraditions, and are putting fresh life and energy into works which will\ngive pleasure to the whole world of readers."--_Philadelphia American_,\nMarch 5, 1887.\n\n_William S.

Authorized edition. In two\n     vols. Paper, $1.00. Cloth, $1.75.\n\n"The date of \'Prusias\' is the latter half of the first century B. C.\nRome is waging her tedious war with Mithridates. There are also risings\nin Spain, and the home army is badly depleted. Prusias comes to Capua as\na learned Armenian, the tutor of a noble pupil in one of the\naristocratic households. Each member of this circle is distinct. Some of\nthe most splendid traits of human nature develop among these grand\nstatesmen and their dignified wives, mothers, and daughters. The ideal\nRoman maiden is Psyche; but she has a trace of Greek blood and of the\nnative gentleness. Of a more interesting type is Fannia, who might,\nminus her slaves and stola, pass for a modern and saucy New York beauty.\nHer wit, spirit, selfishness, and impulsive magnanimity might easily\nhave been a nineteenth-century evolution. In the family to which Prusias\ncomes are two sons, one of military leanings, the other a student. Into\nthe ear of the latter Prusias whispers the real purpose of his coming to\nItaly. He is an Armenian and in league with Mithridates for the\nreduction of Roman rule. The unity which the Senate has tried to extend\nto the freshly-conquered provinces of Italy is a thing of slow growth.\nPrusias by his strategy and helped by Mithridates\'s gold, hopes to\norganize slaves and disaffected provincials into a force which will\noblige weakened Rome to make terms, one of which shall be complete\nemancipation and equality of every man before the law. His harangues are\nin lofty strain, and, save that he never takes the coarse, belligerent\ntone of our contemporaries, these speeches might have been made by one\nof our own Abolitionists. The one point that Prusias never forgets is\npersonal dignity and a regal consideration for his friends. But after\nall, this son of the gods is befooled by a woman, a sinuous and\ntranscendently ambitious Roman belle, the second wife of the dull and\ntrustful prefect of Capua; for this tiny woman had all men in her net\nwhom she found it useful to have there.\n\n"The daughter of the prefect--hard, homely-featured, and hating the\nsupple stepmother with an unspeakable hate, tearing her beauty at last\nlike a tigress and so causing her death--is a repulsive but very strong\nfigure. The two brothers who range themselves on opposite sides in the\nservile war make another unforgettable picture; and the beautiful slave\nBrenna, who follows her noble lover into camp, is a spark of light\nagainst the lurid background. The servile movement is combined with the\nbold plans of the Thracian Spartacus. He is a good figure and\nperpetually surprises us with his keen foresight and disciplinary power.\n\n"The book is stirring, realistic in the even German way, and full of the\nfibre and breath of its century." _Boston Ev\'g Transcript._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n     =THE WILL.=--A NOVEL, by =Ernst Eckstein=, from the German by Clara\n     Bell, in two vols.

The weather had been cold, and so windy that the snow was\noften piled high above our windows; the panes were almost always cloudy\nwith a coating of ice; and throughout the whole season we were shut in,\nrarely finding it possible to go out of the house.\n\nIt was very seldom that any one came to see us, and our few visitors\nbrought neither joy nor cheerfulness to our house. They all had mournful\nfaces, spoke low, as if they were afraid of waking some one, were\ncareful not to laugh, sighed and often shed tears when they looked at\nme, and above all at the sight of my poor Sonia in her little black\nfrock. Everything in the house still savored of death; the affliction,\nthe horror of the last agony yet reigned in the air. Mamma\'s chamber was\nshut up, and I felt a painful dread and yet an irresistible longing to\npeep furtively into the chill, desolate place as I passed it every night\non my way to bed.\n\nI was at this time seventeen years old, and the very year of her death\nMamma had intended to remove to the city, in order to introduce me into\nsociety. The loss of my mother had been a great sorrow to me; but I must\nconfess that to this grief had been added another, that of seeing\nmyself--young, beautiful as I heard from every one that I\nwas,--condemned to vegetate during a second winter in the country, in a\nbarren solitude. Even before the end of this winter, the feeling of\nregret, of isolation, and, to speak plainly, of ennui, had so gained\nupon me that I scarcely ever left my own room, never opened my piano,\nand never even took a book in my hand. If Macha urged me to occupy\nmyself with something I would reply: "I do not wish to, I cannot," and\nfar down in my soul a voice kept asking: "What is the use? Why \'do\nsomething\'--no matter what--when the best of my life is wearing away so\nin pure loss? Why?" And to this "Why?" I had no answer except tears.\n\nI was told that I was growing thin and losing my beauty, but this gave\nme not the slightest concern. Why, and for whom, should I take interest\nin it? It seemed to me that my entire life was to drift slowly away in\nthis desert, borne down by this hopeless suffering, from which, given up\nto my own resources alone, I had no longer the strength, nor even the\nwish, to set myself free.\n\nTowards the end of the winter Macha became seriously uneasy about me,\nand determined come what might to take me abroad. But for this, money\nwas essential, and as yet we knew little of our resources beyond the\nfact that we were to succeed to our mother\'s inheritance; however, we\nwere in daily expectation of a visit from our guardian, who was to\nexamine the condition of our affairs.\n\nHe came at last, late in March.\n\n"Thank Heaven!" said Macha to me one day, when I was wandering like a\nshadow from one corner to another, perfectly idle, without a thought in\nmy head or a wish in my heart: "Sergius Mikailovitch has sent word that\nhe will be here before dinner.--You must rouse yourself, my little\nKatia," she added; "what will he think of you? He loves you both so\nmuch!"\n\nSergius Mikailovitch was our nearest neighbor, and though much his\njunior had been the friend of our dead father. Besides the pleasant\nchange which his arrival might cause in our life, by making it possible\nfor us to leave the country, I had been too much accustomed, from my\nchildhood, to love and respect him, for Macha not to divine while\nurging me to rouse myself, that still another change might be worked and\nthat, of all my acquaintances, he was the one before whom I would be\nmost unwilling to appear in an unfavorable light. Not only did I feel\nthe old attachment for Sergius Mikailovitch which was shared by every\none in the house, from Sonia, who was his god-daughter, down to the\nunder-coachman, but this attachment had derived a peculiar character\nfrom a few words Mamma had once let fall before me. She had said that he\nwas just the husband that she would have wished for me. At the moment\nsuch an idea had appeared to me very extraordinary and even somewhat\ndisagreeable; the hero of my imagination was totally different. My own\nhero was to be slender, delicate, pale, and melancholy. Sergius\nMikailovitch, on the contrary, was no longer young, he was tall and\nlarge, full of vigor, and, so far as I could judge, had an extremely\npleasant temper; nevertheless my mother\'s remark had made a strong\nimpression on my imagination. This had happened six years before, when\nI was only eleven, when he still said "_thou_" to me, played with me,\nand gave me the name of _La petite violette_, yet ever since that day I\nhad always felt some secret misgivings whenever I had asked myself the\nquestion what I should do if he should suddenly take a fancy to marry\nme?\n\nA little before dinner, to which Macha had added a dish of spinach and a\nsweet _entre mets_ Sergius Mikailovitch arrived. I was looking out of\nthe window when his light sledge approached, and as he turned the corner\nof the house I hastily drew back into the drawing-room, not wishing to\nlet him see that I had been watching for him the least in the world. But\nupon hearing sounds in the ante-chamber, his strong voice, and Macha\'s\nfootsteps, I lost patience and went myself to meet him. He was holding\nMacha\'s hand, and talking to her in a raised voice, smiling. When he\nperceived me, he stopped and looked at me for some moments without\nsaluting me; it embarrassed me a good deal, and I felt myself blush.\n\n"Ah! is it possible that this is you, Katia?" he said in his frank,\ndecided tone, disengaging his hand and approaching me.\n\n"Can people change so! How you have grown! Yesterday a violet! To-day\nthe full rose!"\n\nHis large hand clasped mine, pressing it so cordially, so strongly, that\nhe almost hurt me. I had thought he might kiss me, and bent a little\ntowards him; but he only caught it a second time, and looked me straight\nin the eyes with his bright, steady glance.\n\nI had not seen him for six years. He was much changed, older, browner,\nand his whiskers, which he had allowed to grow, were not particularly\nbecoming to him; but he had the same simple manners, the same open,\nhonest face, with its marked features, eyes sparkling with intelligence,\nand smile as sweet as a child\'s.\n\nAt the end of five minutes he was no longer on the footing of a mere\nvisitor, but on that of an intimate guest with us all, and even the\nservants manifested their joy at his arrival, by the eager zeal with\nwhich they served him.\n\nHe did not act at all like a neighbor who, coming to a house for the\nfirst time after the mother\'s death, thinks it necessary to bring with\nhim a solemn countenance; on the contrary, he was gay, talkative, and\ndid not say a single word about Mamma, so that I began to think this\nindifference on the part of a man standing in such near relation to us\nvery strange, and rather unseemly. But I soon saw that it was far from\nbeing indifference, and read in his intention a considerateness for\nwhich I could not help being grateful.\n\nIn the evening Macha gave us tea in the drawing-room where it had been\nusually served during Mamma\'s lifetime. Sonia and I sat near her;\nGregory found one of Papa\'s old pipes, and brought it to our guardian,\nwho began to pace up and down the room according to his old fashion.\n\n"What terrible changes in this house, when one thinks of it!" said he,\nstopping suddenly.\n\n"Yes," replied Macha with a sigh; and replacing the top of the samovar,\nshe looked up at Sergius Mikailovitch, almost ready to burst into\ntears.\n\n"No doubt you remember your father?" he asked me.\n\n"A little."\n\n"How fortunate it would be for you, now, to have him still!" he observed\nslowly, with a thoughtful air, casting a vague glance into vacancy over\nmy head. And he added more slowly still:\n\n"I loved your father very much...."\n\nI thought I detected a new brightness in his eyes at this moment.\n\n"And now God has taken away our mother also!" exclaimed Macha. Dropping\nher napkin on the tea-tray, she pulled out her handkerchief and began to\ncry.\n\n"Yes, there have been terrible changes in this house!"\n\nHe turned away as he spoke.\n\nThen, a moment after: "Katia Alexandrovna," he said, in a louder voice,\n"play me something!"\n\nI liked the tone of frank, friendly authority with which he made this\nrequest; I rose and went to him.\n\n"Here, play me this," said he, opening my Beethoven at the adagio of the\nsonata, _Quasi una fantasia_. "Let us see how you play," he continued,\ntaking his cup of tea to drink in a corner of the room.\n\nI know not why, but I felt it would be impossible either to refuse or to\nput forward a plea of playing badly; on the contrary, I submissively sat\ndown at the piano and began to play as well as I could, although I was\nafraid of his criticism, knowing his excellent taste in music.\n\nIn the tone of this _adagio_ there was a prevalent sentiment which by\nassociation carried me away to the conversation before tea, and, guided\nby this impression, I played tolerably well, it seemed. But he would not\nlet me play the _scherzo_.\n\n"No, you will not play it well," said he, coming to me, "stop with that\nfirst movement,--which has not been bad! I see that you comprehend\nmusic."\n\nThis praise, certainly moderate enough, delighted me so that I felt my\ncolor rise. It was something so new and agreeable to me to have the\nfriend, the _equal_ of my father, speak to me alone, seriously, and no\nlonger as though he were talking to a child as he used to do.\n\nHe talked to me about my father, telling me how they suited each other,\nand what a pleasant life they had led together while I was occupied\nsolely with my playthings and school-books; and what he said revealed my\nfather to me in a light quite new to me, for the first time I seemed to\nknow fully his simple goodness. My guardian questioned me as to what I\nliked, what I read, what I intended doing, and gave me advice. I had no\nlonger beside me the gay talker, delighting in badinage, but a man\nserious, frank, friendly, for whom I felt involuntary respect, while at\nthe same time I was conscious of being in perfect sympathy with him.\nThis consciousness was pleasing to me, nevertheless there was a certain\ntension in conversing with him. Every word I uttered left me timid; I\nwished so much to deserve in my own person the affection which at\npresent I only received because I was my father\'s daughter!\n\nAfter putting Sonia to bed, Macha rejoined us, and began to pour out to\nSergius Mikailovitch her lamentations on the score of my apathy, which\nresulted she complained in my rarely having a single word to say.\n\n"Then she has not told me the most important thing of all," he answered,\nsmiling, and shaking his head at me with an air of reproach.\n\n"What had I to tell?" I replied: "that I was bored?--but that will pass\naway." (And indeed it now seemed to me, not only that my ennui would\npass away, but that it was something already gone by, which could not\nreturn.)\n\n"It is not well not to know how to bear solitude:--is it possible that\nyou are truly a \'grown young lady\'?"\n\n"I believe so!" I answered smiling.\n\n"No, no, or at least a naughty young lady, who only lives to be admired,\nand who, when she finds herself isolated, gives way, and no longer\nenjoys anything; all for show, nothing for herself."\n\n"You have a lovely idea of me, it seems!" I answered, to say something.\n\n"No," he returned, after a moment\'s silence; "it is not in vain that you\nhave that resemblance to your father; _there is something in you_!"\n\nAgain those kind, steadfast eyes exerted their charm over me, filling me\nwith strange emotion.\n\nI noticed for the first time at this moment that the face which to a\ncasual glance seemed so gay, the expression, so peculiarly his own,\nwhere at first one seemed to read only serenity, afterwards revealed\nmore and more clearly, a reserve of deep thought and a shade of sadness.\n\n"You should not feel ennui," he said, "you have music, which you are\nable to understand, books, study; you have before you a whole life, for\nwhich the present is the only moment to prepare yourself, so that\nhereafter you may not have to repine. In a year it will be too late."\n\nHe spoke to me like a father or an uncle, and I understood that he was\nmaking an effort to come to my level. I was a little offended that he\nshould think me so much below him, and on the other hand, it was\ngratifying to feel that he cared to make the effort for my sake.\n\nThe rest of the evening was devoted to a business conversation between\nhim and Macha.\n\n"And now, good-night, my dear Katia," said he, rising, approaching me,\nand taking my hand.\n\n"When shall we see each other again?" asked Macha.\n\n"In the spring," he replied, still holding my hand; "I am now going to\nDanilovka" (our other estate); "I must look into matters there and make\nsome necessary arrangements, then I have to go to Moscow upon business\nof my own, and later--or in the summer--we shall see each other again."\n\n"Why do you go for so long a time?" I asked, dejectedly; for I was\nalready hoping to see him every day, and it was with a sudden sinking of\nmy heart that I thought of again battling with my ennui. Probably my\neyes and voice let this be guessed.\n\n"Come, occupy yourself more; drive away the blues!" he said in a voice\nthat seemed to me too placid and cold. "In the spring I will hold an\nexamination," he added, dropping my hand without looking at me.\n\nWe accompanied him to the ante-chamber, where he hurriedly put on his\npelisse, and again his eyes seemed to avoid mine.\n\n"He is taking very useless trouble!" I said to myself, "can it be\npossible that he thinks he is giving me too great a pleasure by looking\nat me!--An excellent man--Perfectly good.... But that is all."\n\nWe remained awake a long time that night talking, not of him, but of the\nemployment of the ensuing summer, of where and how we should spend the\nwinter. Mighty question, yet why? To me it appeared perfectly simple and\nevident that life was to consist in being happy, and in the future I\ncould imagine nothing but happiness, so suddenly had our sombre old\ndwelling at Pokrovski filled itself with life and light.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nThe spring came. My former ennui had disappeared, and in exchange I felt\nthe dreamy vernal sadness, woven of unknown hopes and unslaked desires.\nBut my life was no longer the existence I had led during the early\nwinter; I occupied myself with Sonia, with music, with studies, and I\noften went into the garden, to spend a long, long, time in wandering\nalone through the shady walks, or in sitting motionless upon some quiet\nbench. God knows what I was thinking, what I was wishing, what I was\nhoping! Sometimes for whole nights, especially if it was moonlight, I\nwould remain kneeling at my window with my elbows on the sill; morning\nwould find me there; and sometimes, without Macha\'s knowing it, I would\nsteal down into the garden again after I was in my simple night-dress,\nand fly through the dew to the little pond; once I even went out into\nthe fields, and spent the rest of the night roaming alone about the\npark.\n\nNow it is difficult for me to recall, still less to comprehend, the\nreveries which at this period filled my imagination. If I can succeed in\nremembering them, I can hardly believe that these reveries were my own,\nso strange were they, so outside of real life.\n\nAt the end of May, Sergius Mikailovitch, as he had promised, returned\nfrom his journey.\n\nThe first time he came to see us was in the evening, when we were not\nexpecting him at all. We were sitting on the terrace, preparing to take\ntea. The garden was in full verdure, and at Pokrovski nightingales had\ntheir homes on all sides in the thick shrubbery. Here and there, large\nclumps of lilacs raised their heads, enamelled with the white or pale\npurple of their opening flowers. The leaves in the birch alleys seemed\ntransparent in the rays of the setting sun. The terrace lay in\nrefreshing shade, and the light evening dew was gathering upon the\ngrass. In the court-yard behind the garden were heard the sounds of\nclosing day, and the lowing of cows returning to their stable; poor\nhalf-witted Nikone came along the path at the foot of the terrace with\nhis huge watering-pot, and soon the torrents of cool water traced in\ndarkening circles over the newly-dug earth of the dahlia beds. Beside us\non the terrace, the shining samovar hissed and sputtered on the white\ncloth, flanked by cream, pancakes, and sweetmeats. Macha, with her plump\nhands, was dipping the cups in hot water like a good housekeeper. As to\nme, with an appetite sharpened by my late bath, I could not wait for\ntea, but was eating a crust of bread soaked in fresh, rich cream. I had\non a linen blouse with loose sleeves, and my damp hair was bound in a\nhandkerchief.\n\nMacha was the first to perceive him.\n\n"Ah! Sergius Mikailovitch!" she cried; "we were just talking about you."\n\nI rose to run in and change my dress; but he met me as I reached the\ndoor.\n\n"Come, Katia, no ceremony in the country," said he, smiling, and looking\nat my head and my handkerchief, "you have no scruples before\nGregory,--I can be Gregory to you."\n\nBut at the same time it darted into my mind that he was not looking at\nme precisely as Gregory would have done, and this embarrassed me.\n\n"I will be back directly," I replied, drawing away from him.\n\n"What is wrong about it?" he exclaimed, following me, "one might take\nyou for a little peasant girl!"\n\n"How strangely he looked at me," I thought, as I hastened up-stairs to\ndress myself. "At last, thank Heaven, here he is, and we shall be\ngayer!" And with a parting glance at the mirror I flew down again, not\neven trying to conceal my eager delight, and reached the terrace, out of\nbreath. He was sitting near the table, talking to Macha about our\nbusiness matters. Noticing me, he gave me a smile, and went on talking.\nOur affairs, he said, were in very satisfactory condition. We had\nnothing to do but to finish our country summer, and then we could go,\neither to St. Petersburg for Sonia\'s education, or abroad.\n\n"That would be very well, if you would come abroad with us," said Macha,\n"but by ourselves we should be like people lost in the woods."\n\n"Ah! would to Heaven I could go around the world with you," was the\nhalf-jesting, half-serious answer.\n\n"Well and good," said I, "let us go around the world then!"\n\nHe smiled and shook his head.\n\n"And my mother? And my business? Come, we will let the tour of the world\nalone, now, and you can tell me how you have passed your time. Can it be\npossible that you have had the blues again?"\n\nWhen I told him that I had been able, without him, to employ myself and\nnot to yield to ennui, and Macha had confirmed the good account, he\npraised me, with the same words and looks of encouragement he would have\nused to a child, and as if he had a perfect right to do so. It seemed to\nme quite natural that I should tell him frankly and minutely everything\nI had done that was right, and also, on the contrary, own to him, as if\nin the confessional, whatever I had done that might deserve his censure.\nThe evening was so beautiful that, when the tea-tray was carried away,\nwe remained upon the terrace, and I found the conversation so\ninteresting that I only gradually became aware that all the sounds from\nthe house were ceasing around us. Upon all sides arose the penetrating\nnight perfume of flowers, the turf was drenched with heavy dew, the\nnightingale in a lilac bush near us was executing his roulades, stopping\nabruptly at the sound of our voices. The starry sky seemed to stoop\nclose above our heads.\n\nWhat warned me that night had come, was the swift, heavy rush of a bat\nbeneath the awning of the terrace, and its blind, terrified circling\naround my white dress. I fell back against the wall, and almost cried\nout, but with another dull swoop it was off again and lost in the\nblackness of the garden.\n\n"How I love your Pokrovski," said Sergius Mikailovitch, interrupting the\nconversation.... "One could linger for a lifetime on this terrace!"\n\n"Well," said Macha, "linger!"\n\n"Ah, yes! linger; but life--does not pause!"\n\n"Why do you not marry?" continued Macha; "you would make an excellent\nhusband!"\n\n"Why?" he repeated, smiling. "People long ago, ceased to count me a\nmarriageable man!"\n\n"What!" replied Macha, "thirty-six years old, and already you pretend to\nbe tired of living?"\n\n"Yes, certainly, and even so tired that I desire nothing but rest. To\nmarry, one must have something else to offer. There, ask Katia," he\nadded, pointing me out with a nod "Girls of her age are the ones for\nmarriage. For us ... our role is to enjoy their happiness."\n\nThere was a secret melancholy, a certain tension in the tone of his\nvoice, which did not escape me. He kept silence a moment; neither Macha\nnor I said anything.\n\n"Imagine now," he resumed, turning towards the table again, "if all at\nonce, by some deplorable accident, I should marry a young girl of\nseventeen, like Katia Alexandrovna! That is a very good example, and I\nam pleased that it applies so well to the point ... there could not be\na better instance."\n\nI began to laugh, but I could not at all understand what pleased him so\nmuch, nor to what it applied so well.\n\n"Come, now, tell me the truth, \'hand on heart,\'" he went on, turning to\nme with a bantering air, "would it not be a great misfortune for you, to\nbind your life to a man already old, who has had his day, and wants\nnothing except to stay just where he is, while you,--Heaven knows where\nyou would not want to run off to, as the fancy took you!"\n\nI felt uncomfortable, and was silent, not knowing very well what to say\nin reply.\n\n"I am not making a proposal for your hand," said he, laughing, "but,\nnow, tell us the truth are you dreaming of such a husband, as you wander\nthrough your alleys in the evening, and would he not be a great\nmisfortune?"\n\n"Not so great a misfortune ..." I began.\n\n"And not so great a boon, either," he finished for me.\n\n"Yes ... but I may be mistaken...."\n\nHe interrupted me again.\n\n"You see?... she is perfectly right.... I like her honesty, and am\ndelighted that we have had this conversation. I will add that--to me--it\nwould have been a supreme misfortune!"\n\n"What an original you are! you have not changed in the least!" said\nMacha, leaving the terrace to order supper to be served.\n\nAfter her departure we were silent, and all was still around us. Then\nthe solitary nightingale recommenced, not his abrupt, undecided notes of\nearly evening, but his night song, slow and tranquil, whose thrilling\ncadence filled the garden; and from far down the ravine came for the\nfirst time a response from another nightingale. The one near us was mute\nfor a moment, listening, then burst out anew in a rapture of song,\nlouder and clearer than before. Their voices resounded, calm and\nsupreme, amid that world of night which is their own and which we\ninhabit as aliens. The gardener went by, on his way to his bed in the\norange-house, we heard his heavy boots on the path as he went farther\nand farther from us. Some one in the direction of the mountain blew two\nshrill, quick notes on a whistle, then all was still once more. Scarcely\na leaf was heard to move; yet all at once the awning of the terrace\npuffed out slowly, stirred by a breath of air, and a more penetrating\nperfume stole up to us from below. The silence embarrassed me, but I did\nnot know what to say. I looked at him. His eyes, bright in the darkness,\nwere fixed upon me.\n\n"It is good to live in this world!" he murmured.\n\nI know not why, but at the words I sighed.\n\n"Well?" he questioned.\n\n"Yes, it is good to live in this world!" I repeated.\n\nAgain the silence fell upon us, and again I felt ill at ease. I could\nnot get it out of my head that I had hurt him, by agreeing with him that\nhe was old; I would have liked to console him, but did not know how to\nset about it.\n\n"But good-bye!" he said, rising, "my mother expects me to supper. I\nhave hardly seen her to-day."\n\n"I would have liked to play you my new sonata."\n\n"Another time," he replied coldly, at least so it seemed to me; then,\nmoving off a step, he said with a careless gesture: "Good-bye!"\n\nI was more than ever convinced that I had given him pain, and this\ndistressed me. Macha and I went with him, as far as the porch, and stood\nthere awhile looking down the road where he had disappeared. When we no\nlonger caught the slightest echo from his horse\'s feet, I began to walk\nabout the terrace and watch the garden, and I remained a long time\nthere, amid the heavy mist that deadened all the sounds of night, busy\nseeing and hearing whatever my fancy chose to make me see and hear.\n\nHe came a second time, a third time, and the little embarrassment caused\nby our strange conversation soon vanished, and never returned.\n\nThroughout the whole summer he came to see us two or three times a week;\nI was so accustomed to him that, when a longer time than usual passed\nwithout his coming, it seemed to me painful to live alone; I was\nsecretly indignant with him, and thought he was behaving badly in thus\ndeserting me. He transformed himself for me, as it were, into a friendly\ncomrade; inducing the most sincere frankness on my part, giving me\nadvice and encouragement, scolding me sometimes, checking me when\nnecessary. But despite these efforts to remain always upon my level, I\nwas conscious that, besides all I knew of him, there existed within him\nan entire world, to which I was a stranger, and he did not think it was\nnecessary to admit me; and this, more than anything else, tended to keep\nup my feeling of deference, and at the same time to attract me towards\nhim. I knew from Macha and the neighbors that, besides his attentive\ncare of his old mother, with whom he lived, besides his agricultural\ninterests, and our guardianship, he had also on hand certain matters\naffecting all the nobles, which caused him much trouble and annoyance;\nbut how he faced this complex situation, what were his thoughts, his\nplans, his hopes, I could never discover from him. If I endeavored to\nlead the conversation to his own affairs, a certain line appeared upon\nhis brow, which seemed to say: "Stop there, if you please; what is that\nto you?" And he would immediately speak of something else. At first this\noffended me, then I grew so accustomed to it that we never talked of\nanything but what concerned me; which I finally came to think quite a\nmatter of course.\n\nAt first, too, I felt some displeasure, (while afterwards, on the\ncontrary, it had a kind of charm,) in seeing the perfect indifference, I\nmight almost say contempt, which he showed for my appearance. Never, by\nword or look, did he give the least idea that he thought me pretty; far\nfrom it, he frowned and began to laugh if any one remarked before him\nthat I was "not bad-looking." He even took pleasure in criticizing the\ndefects in my face, and teasing me about them. The fashionable dresses,\nthe coiffures, with which Macha delighted to adorn me on our holidays,\nonly excited his raillery, which chagrined my good Macha not a little,\nand at first disconcerted me. Macha, who had settled in her own mind\nthat I was pleasing to Sergius Mikailovitch, could not at all comprehend\nwhy he did not prefer that a woman whom he admired should appear at her\nbest. But I soon discovered what was the matter. He wished to believe\nthat I was not coquettish. As soon as I understood this there no longer\nremained a trace of coquetry in my dress, hair, or manner; it was\nreplaced--usual and shallow little trick--by another coquetry, the\nassumption of simplicity, before I had attained the point of really\nbeing artless. I saw that he loved me: whether as a child or woman I had\nnot hitherto asked myself: this love was dear to me, and feeling that he\nconsidered me the best girl in the world, I could not help wishing that\nthe delusion might continue to blind him. And indeed I deceived him\nalmost involuntarily. But in deluding him, I was nevertheless growing\nmore what he thought me. I felt that it would be better and more worthy\nof him to unveil to him the good points of my soul rather than those of\nmy person. My hair, my hands, my face, my carriage, whatever they might\nbe, whether good or bad,--it seemed to me he could appreciate at one\nglance, and that he knew very well that, had I desired to deceive him, I\ncould add nothing at all to my exterior. My soul, on the contrary, he\ndid not know: because he loved it, because just at this time it was in\nfull process of growth and development, and finally because in such a\nmatter it was easy to deceive him, and that I was in fact deceiving him.\nWhat relief I felt in his presence, when once I comprehended all this!\nThe causeless agitation, the need of movement, which in some way\noppressed me, completely disappeared. It seemed to me henceforth that\nwhether opposite or beside me, whether standing or sitting, whether I\nwore my hair dressed high or low, he looked at me always with\nsatisfaction, that he now knew me entirely; and I imagined that he was\nas well pleased with me, as I myself was. I verily believe that if,\ncontrary to his custom, he had suddenly said to me as others did that I\nwas pretty, I should even have been a little sorry. But, on the other\nhand, what joy, what serenity, I felt in the depth of my soul, if, upon\nthe occasion of my expressing some thought or letting fall a few words,\nhe looked at me attentively and said in a moved tone which he strove to\nrender light and jesting:\n\n"Yes, yes, there is _something_ in you! You are a good girl, and I ought\nto tell you so."\n\nAnd for what did I receive this recompense which filled my heart with\njoy and pride? Perhaps because I had said that I sympathized with old\nGregory\'s love for his little daughter, perhaps because I had been\naffected to tears while reading a poem or a romance, perhaps for\npreferring Mozart to Schuloff! I was amazed by this new intuition, which\nenabled me to divine what was good and what one ought to like, though as\nyet I had no positive knowledge of either. Most of my past habits and\ntastes were displeasing to him, and a look or an imperceptible movement\nof his eyebrows was enough to make me understand his disapproval of what\nI was about to do; while a certain air of slightly disdainful pity,\nwhich was peculiar to him, would at once make me believe that I no\nlonger liked what had formerly pleased me. If the thought of giving me\nadvice upon any subject, occurred to him, I knew beforehand what he was\ngoing to say to me. He questioned me with a glance, and already this\nglance had drawn from me the thought he wished to ascertain. All my\nthoughts, all my feelings during that time, were not my own; they were\nhis, which suddenly became mine, penetrating and illuminating my life.\nIn a manner insensible to me, I began to see everything with other eyes,\nMacha, my servants, Sonia, as well as myself and my own occupations. The\nbooks which formerly I had read only in order to ward off ennui appeared\nto me all at once one of the greatest charms of life, and for no reason\nexcept that we talked, he and I, of books, that we read them together,\nthat he brought them to me. Hitherto I had considered my work with\nSonia, the lessons I gave her, as a painful obligation, only fulfilled\nfrom a sense of duty; now that he sometimes came to assist at these\nlessons one of my delights was to observe Sonia\'s progress. To learn an\nentire piece of music had always seemed impossible, and now, knowing\nthat he would listen and perhaps applaud it, I thought nothing of going\nover the same passage forty times in succession, poor Macha would end by\nstopping her ears with cotton wool, while I would not consider the\nperformance at all tiresome. The old sonatas spoke out under my fingers\nin a very different and very superior voice. Even Macha, whom I had\nalways known and loved as myself, seemed totally changed. It was only\nnow that I understood that nothing had compelled her to be what she had\nbeen to us, a mother, a friend, a slave to our whims and fancies. I\ncomprehended all the abnegation, all the devotion, of this loving\ncreature, I realized the greatness of my obligations to her, and loved\nher so much the more. He had already taught me to regard our people, our\npeasants, our drorovies,[A] our men and women servants, in a totally\ndifferent light. It is an odd fact, but at seventeen years of age, I was\nliving in the midst of them a far greater stranger to them than to\npeople I had never seen; not once had it crossed my mind that they were\nbeings capable like myself of love, desires, regrets. Our garden, our\nwoods, our fields, which I had known ever since I was born, suddenly\nbecame quite new to me, and I began to admire their loveliness. There\nwas no error in the remark which he so often made, that, in life, there\nwas but one certain happiness: to live for others. This had appeared\nstrange to me, and I had not been able to understand it; but the\nconviction, unknown even to my own mind, was penetrating little by\nlittle into the depths of my heart. In short, he had opened before me a\nnew life, full of present delights, without having in any wise changed\nor added to my old existence, save by developing each of my own\nsensations. From my infancy everything around me had remained buried in\na sort of silence, only awaiting his presence to lift up a voice, speak\nto my soul, and fill it with happiness.\n\nOften, in the course of this summer, I would go up to my chamber, throw\nmyself upon my bed, and there, in place of the old anguish of the\nspring, full of desires and hopes for the future, I would feel myself\nwrapped in another emotion, that of present happiness. I could not\nsleep, I would get up and go and sit on the side of Macha\'s bed, and\ntell her that I was perfectly happy,--which, as I look back upon it\nto-day was perfectly needless; she could see it well enough for herself.\nShe would reply that neither had she anything more to wish for, that she\ntoo was very happy, and would embrace me. I believed her, so entirely\nnatural and necessary did it seem to me for every one to be happy. But\nMacha had her night\'s rest to think of, so, pretending to be angry, she\nwould drive me away from her bed, and drop off to sleep; I, on the\ncontrary, would lie for a long time running over all my reasons for\nbeing gladsome. Sometimes I would rise, and begin my prayers a second\ntime, praying in the fulness of my heart that I might thank God better\nfor all the happiness He had granted me. In my chamber all was peaceful;\nthere was no sound save the long-drawn regular breathing of the\nsleeping Macha, and the ticking of the watch by her side; I would return\nto bed, murmur a few words, cross myself, or kiss the little cross\nhanging at my neck. The doors were locked, the shutters fast over the\nwindows, the buzzing of a fly struggling in a corner came to my ear. I\ncould have wished never to leave this room; desired that morning might\nnever come to dissipate the atmosphere impregnated with my soul, that\nenveloped me. It seemed to me that my dreams, my thoughts, my prayers,\nwere so many animated essences which in this darkness lived with me,\nfluttered about my pillow, hovered above my head. And every thought was\nhis thought, every feeling his feeling. I did not yet know what love\nwas, I thought that it might always be thus--that it might give itself\nand ask nothing in return.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nOne day, during the grain harvest, Macha, Sonia, and I, went into the\ngarden after dinner, to our favorite bench under the shade of the\nlinden-trees at the head of the ravine, whence we could see the fields\nand the woods. For three days Sergius Mikailovitch had not been to see\nus, and we looked for him all the more confidently to-day, as he had\npromised our intendant to visit the harvest fields.\n\nAbout two o\'clock we saw him coming over the rising ground in the middle\nof a rye field. Macha, giving me a smile, ordered a servant to bring out\nsome peaches and cherries, which he was very fond of, then stretched\nherself upon the bench and was soon fast asleep. I broke off a little\nlinden bough, its leaves and bark fresh with young sap, and, while I\nfanned Macha, went on with my reading, not without turning every instant\nto watch the field-path by which he must come to us. Sonia had\nestablished herself on a linden root, and was busy putting up a green\narbor for her dolls.\n\nThe day was very warm, without wind, it seemed as if we were in a\nhot-house; the clouds, lying in a low circle upon the horizon, had\nlooked angry in the morning, and there had been a threat of storm,\nwhich, as was always the case, had excited and agitated me. But since\nmid-day the clouds had dispersed, the sun was free in a clear sky, the\nthunder was only muttering at a single point, rolling slowly through the\ndepths of a heavy cloud which, seeming to unite earth and heaven,\nblended with the dust of the fields, and was furrowed by pale zig-zags\nof distant lightning. It was evident that for us at least there was no\nmore to be dreaded for that day. In the part of the road running behind\nthe garden there was continual sound and motion, now the slow, long\ngrind of a wagon loaded with sheaves, now the quick jolt of the empty\ntelegas[B] as they passed each other, or the rapid steps of the\ndrivers, whose white smocks we could see fluttering as they hurried\nalong. The thick dust neither blew away nor fell, it remained suspended\nabove the hedges, a hazy background for the clear green leaves of the\ngarden trees. Farther off, about the barn, resounded more voices, more\ngrinding wheels; and I could see the yellow sheaves, brought in the\ncarts to the enclosure, being tossed off into the air, and heaped up,\nuntil at length I could distinguish the stacks, rising like oval\nsharp-roofed buildings, and the silhouettes of the peasants swarming\nabout them. Presently, there were new _telegas_ moving in the dusty\nfields, new piles of yellow sheaves, and in the distance the wheels, the\nvoices, the chanted songs.\n\nThe dust and heat invaded everything, except our little favorite nook of\nthe garden. Yet on all sides, in the dust and heat, the blaze of the\nburning sun, the throng of laborers chattered, made merry, and kept in\ncontinual movement. As for me, I looked at Macha, sleeping so sweetly on\nour bench, her face shaded by her cambric handkerchief; the black juicy\ncherries on the plate; our light, dazzlingly clean dresses, the carafe\nof clear water, where the sun\'s rays were playing in a little rainbow;\nand I felt a sense of rare comfort. "What must I do?" thought I;\n"perhaps it is wicked to be so happy? But can we diffuse our happiness\naround us? How, and to whom, can we wholly consecrate\nourselves--ourselves and this very happiness?"\n\nThe sun had disappeared behind the tops of the old birch-trees bordering\nthe path, the dust had subsided; the distances of the landscape stood\nout, clear and luminous, under the slanting rays; the clouds had\ndispersed entirely, long ago; on the other side of the trees I could\nsee, near the barn, the pointed tops rise upon three new stacks of\ngrain, and the peasants descend from them; finally, for the last time\nthat day, the _telegas_ passed rapidly, making the air resound with\ntheir noisy jolts; the women were going homewards, singing, their rakes\non their shoulders, and their binding withes hanging at their girdles;\nand still Sergius Mikailovitch did not come, although long ago I had\nseen him at the foot of the mountain. Suddenly he appeared at the end of\nthe path, from a direction where I had not been looking for him at all,\nfor he had to skirt the ravine to reach it. Raising his hat he came\ntowards me, his face lighted up with sudden joy. At the sight of Macha,\nstill asleep, his eyes twinkled, he bit his lip, and began tip-toeing\nelaborately. I saw at once that he was in one of those fits of causeless\ngayety which I liked so much in him, and which, between ourselves, we\ncalled "_le transport sauvage_." At such times he was like a boy just\nlet out of school, his whole self from head to foot instinct with\ndelight and happiness.\n\n"How do you do, little violet, how goes the day with you? Well?" said\nhe, in a low voice, coming near and pressing my hand.... "And with me?\noh, charmingly, also!" he replied to my similar question, "to-day I am\nreally not over thirteen years old; I would like to ride a\nstick-horse,--I want to climb the trees!"\n\n"_Le transport sauvage!_" I commented, looking into his laughing eyes,\nand feeling this _transport sauvage_ take possession of me also.\n\n"Yes," he murmured, at the same time raising his eyebrows with an\nenquiring glance, and keeping back a smile. "But why are you so furious\nwith our poor Macha Karlovna?"\n\nIn fact I then became conscious that, while I was gazing up at him and\ncontinuing to brandish my linden bough, I had whipped off Macha\'s\nhandkerchief, and was sweeping her face with the leaves. I could not\nhelp laughing.\n\n"And she will say she has not been asleep," I said, whispering, as if\nafraid of waking her; but I did not do it altogether for that,--it was\nso delightful to whisper when I spoke to him!\n\nHe moved his lips in almost dumb show, imitating me, and as if he, on\nhis side, was saying something that no one else must hear. Then, spying\nthe plate of cherries, he pretended to seize it and carry it off by\nstealth, running away towards Sonia, and dropping on the grass under the\nlinden-tree in the midst of her accumulation of dolls. Sonia was about\nto fly into a little rage, but he made peace with her by proposing a\nnew game, the point of which lay in seeing which of the two could devour\nthe most cherries.\n\n"Shall I order some more?" I asked, "or shall we go gather them for\nourselves?"\n\nHe picked up the plate, piled Sonia\'s dolls in it, and we all three\nstarted for the cherry orchard. Sonia, shouting with laughter, trotted\nafter him, tugging at his coat to make him give her back her family. He\ndid so; and turning gravely to me:\n\n"Come, how can you convince me that you are not a violet?" he said,\nstill speaking very low, though there was now no one for him to be\nafraid of waking; "as soon as I came near you, after having been through\nso much dust and heat and fatigue, I seemed to perceive the fragrance of\na violet, not, it is true, that violet with the powerful perfume, but\nthe little early one, you know, which steals out first, still modest, to\nbreathe at once the expiring snow and the springing grass...."\n\n"But, tell me, is the harvest coming on well?" I put in hastily, to\ncover the happy confusion his words caused me.\n\n"Wonderfully! what excellent people these all are,--the more one knows\nthem, the more one loves them."\n\n"Oh, yes!--A little while ago, before you came, I sat watching their\nwork, and it really went to my conscience to see them toiling so\nfaithfully, while I was just idly taking my ease, and...."\n\n"Do not play with these sentiments, Katia," he interrupted, with a\nserious manner, giving me at the same time a caressing glance, "there is\nholy work there. May God guard you from _posing_ in such matters!"\n\n"But it was only to you that I said that!"\n\n"I know it.--Well, and our cherries?"\n\nThe cherry orchard was locked, not a single gardener was to be found (he\nhad sent them all to the harvest fields). Sonia ran off to look for the\nkey; but, without waiting for her return, he climbed up at a corner by\ncatching hold of the meshes of the net, and jumped down inside the\nwall.\n\n"Will you give me the plate?" he asked me, from within.\n\n"No, I want to gather some, myself; I will go get the key, I doubt if\nSonia can find it."\n\nBut at that moment a sudden fancy seized me, to find out what he was\ndoing there, how he looked, in short his demeanor when he supposed no\none could see him. Or rather, honestly, perhaps just then I did not feel\nlike losing sight of him for a single instant. So on my tip-toes,\nthrough the nettles, I made a circuit around the little orchard and\ngained the opposite side, where the enclosure was lower; there, stepping\nup on an empty tub, I found the wall but breast-high, and leaned over. I\nmade a survey of everything within; looked at the crooked old trees, the\nlarge serrated leaves, the black, vertical clusters of juicy fruit; and,\nslipping my head under the net, I could observe Sergius Mikailovitch\nthrough the twisted boughs of an old cherry-tree. He was certainly\nconfident that I had gone, and that no one could see him.\n\nWith bared head and closed eyes he was sitting on the mouldering trunk\nof an old tree, absently rolling between his fingers a bit of\ncherry-gum. All at once, he opened his eyes, and murmured something,\nwith a smile. The word and smile were so little in keeping with what I\nknew of him that I was ashamed of having watched him. It really seemed\nto me that the word was: Katia! "That cannot be!" I said to myself.\n"Dear Katia!" he repeated lower, and still more tenderly. And this time\nI heard the two words distinctly. My heart began to beat so fast, I was\nso filled with joyful emotion, I even felt, as it were, such a kind of\nshock, that I had to hold on to the wall with both hands, to keep myself\nfrom falling, and so betraying myself. He heard my movement, and glanced\nbehind him, startled; then suddenly casting down his eyes he blushed,\nreddening like a child. He made an effort to speak to me, but could not,\nand this failure made his face grow deeper and deeper scarlet. Yet he\nsmiled as he looked at me. I smiled at him too. He looked all alive with\nhappiness; this was no longer, then,--oh, no, this _was_ no longer an\nold uncle lavishing cares and caresses upon me; I had there before my\neyes a man on my own level, loving me and fearing me; a man whom I\nmyself feared, and loved. We did not speak, we only looked at each\nother. But suddenly he bent his brows darkly; smile and glow went out of\nhis eyes simultaneously, and his bearing became again cold and fatherly,\nas if we had been doing something wrong, as if he had regained control\nof himself and was counselling me to do the same.\n\n"Get down from there, you will hurt yourself," said he. "And arrange\nyour hair; you ought to see what you look like!"\n\n"Why does he dissemble so? Why does he wish to wound me?" I thought,\nindignantly. And at the moment came an irresistible desire to move him\nagain, and to try my power over him.\n\n"No, I want to gather some cherries, myself," I said; and grasping a\nneighboring bough with my hands, I swung myself over the wall. He had\nno time to catch me, I dropped to the ground in the middle of the little\nspace.\n\n"What folly is this?" he exclaimed, flushing again, and endeavoring to\nconceal his alarm under a semblance of anger. "You might injure\nyourself! And how are you going to get out?"\n\nHe was much more perturbed than when he first caught sight of me; but\nnow this agitation no longer gladdened me, on the contrary it made me\nafraid. I was attacked by it in my turn; I blushed, moved away, no\nlonger knowing what to say to him, and began to pick cherries very fast,\nwithout having anything to put them in. I reproached myself, I repented,\nI was frightened, it seemed to me that by this step I had ruined myself\nforever in his eyes. We both remained speechless, and the silence\nweighed heavily upon both. Sonia, running back with the key, freed us\nfrom our embarrassing situation. However, we still persistently avoided\nspeaking to each other, both preferring to address little Sonia instead.\nWhen we were again with Macha, (who vowed she had not been asleep, and\nhad heard everything that had gone on,) my calmness returned, while he,\non his side, made another effort to resume his tone of paternal\nkindness. But the effort was not successful, and did not deceive me at\nall. A certain conversation that had taken place two days before still\nlived in my memory.\n\nMacha had announced her opinion that a man loves more easily than a\nwoman, and also more easily expresses his love. She added:\n\n"A man can say that he loves, and a woman cannot."\n\n"Now it seems to me that a man neither ought nor can say that he loves,"\nwas his reply.\n\nI asked him why.\n\n"Because it would always be a lie. What is this discovery that a man\n_loves_? As if he had only to pronounce the word, and there must\nimmediately spring from it something extraordinary, some phenomenon or\nother, exploding all at once! It seems to me that those people who say\nto you solemnly: \'I love you,\' either deceive themselves, or, which is\nworse, deceive others."\n\n"Then you think a woman is to know that she is loved, without being\ntold?" asked Macha.\n\n"That I do not know; every man has his own fashion of speech. But such\nfeelings make themselves understood. When I read a novel, I always try\nto imagine the embarrassed air of Lieutenant Crelski or Alfred, as he\ndeclares: \'Eleonore, I love thee!\' which speech he fancies is going to\nproduce something astounding, all of a sudden,--while in reality it\ncauses nothing at all, neither in her nor in him: features, look,\neverything, remain precisely the same!"\n\nHe spoke jestingly, but I thought I detected an undertone of serious\nmeaning, which might have some reference to me; and Macha never allowed\neven playful aspersions upon her heroes of romance.\n\n"Always paradoxes!" she exclaimed. "Come now, be honest, have you\nyourself never said to a woman that you loved her?"\n\n"Never have I said so, never have I bowed a knee," he replied laughing,\n"and never will I!"\n\n"Yes, he need not tell me that he loves me!" I thought, now vividly\nrecalling this conversation. "He does love me, and I know it. And all\nhis efforts to seem indifferent cannot take away this conviction!"\n\nDuring the whole evening he said very little to me, but in every word,\nin every look and motion, I felt love, and no longer had any doubts. The\nonly thing that vexed and troubled me was that he should still judge it\nnecessary to conceal this feeling, and to feign coldness, when already\nall was so clear, and we might have been so easily and so frankly happy\nalmost beyond the verge of possibility. Then, too, I was tormenting\nmyself as though I had committed a crime, for having jumped down into\nthe cherry orchard to join him, and it seemed as if he must have ceased\nto esteem me, and must feel resentment against me.\n\nAfter tea, I went to the piano, and he followed.\n\n"Play something, Katia, I have not heard you for a long time," he said,\njoining me in the drawing-room.\n\n"I wished ... Sergius Mikailovitch!" And suddenly I looked right into\nhis eyes. "You are not angry with me?"\n\n"Why should I be?"\n\n"Because I did not obey you this afternoon," said I, blushing.\n\nHe understood me, shook his head, and smiled. And this smile said that\nperhaps he would willingly have scolded me a little, but had no longer\nthe strength to do so.\n\n"That is done with, then, isn\'t it? And we are good friends again?" I\nasked, seating myself at the piano.\n\n"I think so, indeed!"\n\nThe large, lofty apartment was lighted, only by the two candles upon the\npiano, and the greater portion of it was in semi-darkness; through the\nopen windows we beheld the luminous stillness of the summer night. The\nmost perfect calm reigned, only broken at intervals by Macha\'s footfall\nin the adjoining room, which was not yet lighted, or by an occasional\nrestless snort or stamp from our visitor\'s horse, which was tied under\none of the casements. Sergius Mikailovitch was seated behind me, so\nthat I could not see him, but in the imperfect darkness of the room, in\nthe soft notes that filled it, in the very depths of my being, I seemed\nto feel his presence. Every look, every movement, though I could not\ndistinguish them, seemed to enter and echo in my heart. I was playing\nMozart\'s Caprice-sonata, which he had brought me, and which I had\nlearned before him and for him. I was not thinking at all of what I\nplayed, but I found that I was playing well and thought he was pleased.\nI shared his enjoyment, and without seeing him, I knew that from his\nplace his eyes were fixed on me. By a quite involuntary movement, while\nmy fingers continued to run over the keys, unconscious of what they were\ndoing, I turned and looked at him; his head stood out in dark relief\nagainst the luminous background of the night. He was sitting with his\nbrow resting on his hand, watching me attentively with sparkling eyes.\nAs mine met them, I smiled, and stopped playing. He smiled also, and\nmade a motion with his head towards my notes, as if reproaching me and\nbegging me to keep on. Just then the moon, midway in her course, soared\nin full splendor from a light cloud, pouring into the room waves of\nsilvery radiance which overcame the feeble gleam of our wax candles, and\nswept in a sea of glory over the inlaid floor. Macha said that what I\nhad done was like nothing at all, that I had stopped at the very\nloveliest part, and that, besides, I had played miserably; he, on the\ncontrary, insisted that I had never succeeded better than this evening,\nand began pacing about restlessly, from the dim drawing-room into the\nhall, from the hall back again into the drawing-room, and every time he\npassed he looked at me and smiled. I smiled too though without any\nreason; I wanted to laugh, so happy was I at what had taken place that\nday, at that moment even. While the door hid him from me for an instant\nI pounced upon Macha and began to kiss her in my pet place on her soft\nthroat under her chin, but when he reappeared I was perfectly grave,\nalthough it was hard work to keep from laughing.\n\n"What has happened to her, to-day?" Macha said.\n\nHe made no answer, but began to tease and make laughing conjectures. He\nknew well enough what had happened to me!\n\n"Just see what a night!" he said presently, from the door of the\ndrawing-room, opening on the garden balcony.\n\nWe went and stood by him, and indeed I never remember such a night. The\nfull moon shone down upon us from above the house with a glory I have\nnever seen in her since; the long shadows of the roof, of the slender\ncolumns and tent-shaped awning of the terrace stretched out in oblique\nforeshortening, over the gravel walk and part of the large oval of turf.\nThe rest lay in brilliant light, glistening with dew-drops turned by the\nmoon\'s rays to liquid silver. A wide path, bordered with flowers, was\ndiagonally cut into at one edge by the shadows of tall dahlias and their\nsupporting stakes, and then ran on, an unbroken band of white light and\ngleaming pebbles until it was lost in the mist of distance. The glass\nroof of the orangery sparkled through the trees, and a soft vapor\nstealing up the sides of the ravine grew denser every moment. The tufts\nof lilac, now partially faded, were pierced through and through by the\nlight; every slender foot-stalk was visible, and the tiny flowers,\nfreshened by the dew, could easily be distinguished from each other. In\nthe paths light and shadow were so blended that one would no longer have\nsaid there were trees and paths, but transparent edifices shaken with\nsoft vibrations. On the right of the house all was obscure, indistinct,\nalmost a horror of darkness. But out of it sprang, more resplendent from\nthe black environment, the fantastic head of a poplar which, by some\nstrange freak, ended abruptly close above the house in an aureole of\nclear light, instead of rising to lose itself in the distant depths of\ndark blue sky.\n\n"Let us go to walk," said I.\n\nMacha consented, but added that I must put on my galoshes.\n\n"It is not necessary," I said; "Sergius Mikailovitch will give me his\narm."\n\nAs if that could keep me from getting my feet wet! But at that moment,\nto each of us three, such absurdity was admissible, and caused no\nastonishment. He had never given me his arm, and now I took it of my own\naccord, and he did not seem surprised. We all three descended to the\nterrace. The whole universe, the sky, the garden, the air we breathed,\nno longer appeared to me what I had always known.\n\nAs I looked ahead of me in the path we were pursuing, I began to fancy\nthat one could not go beyond, that there the possible world ended, and\nthat all there would abide forever in its present loveliness.\n\nHowever, as we went on, this enchanted wall, this barrier built of pure\nbeauty, receded before us and yielded us passage, and I found myself in\nthe midst of familiar objects, garden, trees, paths, dry leaves. These\nwere certainly real paths that we were pursuing, where we crossed\nalternate spaces of light and spheres of darkness, where the dry leaves\nrustled beneath our feet, and the dewy sprays softly touched my cheek as\nwe passed. It was really he, who walked by my side with slow, steady\nsteps and with distant formality, allowed my arm to rest upon his own.\nIt was the real moon, high in the heavens, whose light came down to us\nthrough the motionless branches.\n\nOnce I looked at him. There was only a single linden in the part of the\npath we were then following, and I could see his face clearly. He was so\nhandsome; he looked so happy....\n\nHe was saying: "Are you not afraid?" But the words I heard, were: "I\nlove thee, dear child! I love thee! I love thee!" His look said it, and\nhis arm said it; the light, the shadow, the air, and all things repeated\nit.\n\nWe went through the whole garden, Macha walked near us, taking short\nsteps, and panting a little, she was so tired. She said it was time to\ngo in, and I was so sorry for the poor creature. "Why does not she feel\nlike us?" I thought. "Why is not everybody always young and happy? How\nfull this night is of youth and happiness,--and we too!"\n\nWe returned to the house, but it was a long time before Sergius\nMikailovitch went away. Macha forgot to remind us that it was late; we\ntalked of all sorts of things, perhaps trivial enough, sitting side by\nside without the least suspicion that it was three o\'clock in the\nmorning. The cocks had crowed for the third time, before he went. He\ntook leave of us as usual, not saying anything particular. But I could\nnot doubt that from this day he was mine, and I could no longer lose\nhim. Now that I recognized that I loved him, I told Macha all. She was\ndelighted and touched, but the poor woman got no sleep that night; and\nas for me, after walking a long, long time up and down the terrace, I\nwent to the garden again, seeking to recall every word, every incident,\nas I wandered through the paths where we had so lately passed together.\nI did not go to bed, that night, and, for the first time in my life, I\nsaw the sun rise and knew what the dawn of day is. Never again have I\nseen such a night and such a morning. But I still kept asking myself why\nhe did not tell me frankly that he loved me. "Why," thought I, "does he\ninvent such or such difficulties, why does he consider himself old,\nwhen everything is so simple and so beautiful? Why lose thus a precious\ntime which perhaps will never return? Let him say that he loves, let him\nsay it in words, let him take my hand in his, bend down his head and\nsay: "I love." Let his face flush, and his eyes fall before me, and then\nI will tell him all. Or, rather, I will tell him nothing, I will only\nhold him fast in my arms and let my tears flow. But if I am\nmistaken?--if he does not love me?" This thought suddenly crossed my\nmind.\n\nI was terrified by my own feeling. Heaven knows where it might have led\nme; already the memory of his confusion and my own when I suddenly\ndropped down into the cherry orchard beside him, weighed upon me,\noppressed my heart. The tears filled my eyes, and I began to pray. Then\na thought, a strange thought, came to me, which brought me a great\nquietness, and rekindled my hope. This was, the resolution to commence\nmy devotions, and to choose my birthday as my betrothal day.\n\nHow and why? How could it come to pass? That I knew nothing about,--but\nfrom this moment I believed that it would be so. In the meantime, broad\nday had come, and every one was rising as I returned to my chamber.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\nIt was the _Careme de l\'Assomption_,[C] and consequently no one was\nsurprised at my commencing a season of devotion.\n\nDuring this whole week Sergius Mikailovitch did not once come to see us,\nand far from being surprised, alarmed, or angry with him, I was content,\nand did not expect him before my birthday. Throughout this week I rose\nvery early every day, and while the horses were being harnessed I walked\nin the garden, alone, meditating upon the past, and thinking what I must\ndo in order that the evening should find me satisfied with my day, and\nproud of having committed no faults.\n\nWhen the horses were ready, I entered the droschky, accompanied by Macha\nor a maid-servant, and drove about three versts to church. In entering\nthe church, I never failed to remember that we pray there for all those\n"who enter this place in the fear of God," and I strove to rise to the\nlevel of this thought, above all when my feet first touched the two\ngrass-grown steps of the porch. At this hour there were not usually in\nthe church more than ten or a dozen persons, peasants and drorovies,\npreparing to make their devotions; I returned their salutations with\nmarked humility, and went myself, (which I regarded as an act of\nsuperior merit,) to the drawer where the wax tapers were kept, received\na few from the hand of the old soldier who performed the office of\nstaroste,[D] and placed them before the images. Through the door of the\nsanctuary I could see the altar-cloth Mamma had embroidered, and above\nthe iconstase[E] two angels spangled with stars, which I had considered\nmagnificent when I was a little girl; and a dove surrounded by a gilded\naureole which, at that same period, often used to absorb my attention.\nBehind the choir I caught a glimpse of the embossed fonts near which I\nhad so often held the children of our drorovies, and where I myself had\nreceived baptism. The old priest appeared, wearing a chasuble cut from\ncloth which had been the pall of my father\'s coffin, and he intoned the\nservice in the same voice which, as far back as I could remember, had\nchanted the offices of the Church at our house, at Sonia\'s baptism, at\nmy father\'s funeral service, at my mother\'s burial. In the choir I heard\nthe familiar cracked voice of the precentor; I saw, as I had always seen\nher, a certain old woman, almost bent double, who came to every service,\nleaned her back against the wall, and, holding her faded handkerchief in\nher tightly clasped hands, gazed with eyes full of tears at one of the\nimages in the choir, mumbling I knew not what prayers with her toothless\nmouth. And all these objects, all these beings,--it was not mere\ncuriosity or reminiscence which brought them so near to me; all seemed\nin my eyes great and holy, all were full of profound meaning.\n\nI lent an attentive ear to every word of the prayers I heard read, I\nendeavored to bring my feelings into accord with them, and if I did not\ncomprehend them, I mentally besought God to enlighten me, or substituted\na petition of my own for that which I had not understood. When the\npenitential prayers were read, I recalled my past, and this past of my\ninnocent childhood appeared to me so black in comparison with the state\nof serenity in which my soul was, at this time, that I wept over myself,\nterrified; yet I felt that all was forgiven me, and that even if I had\nhad many more faults to reproach myself with, repentance would only have\nbeen all the sweeter to me.\n\nAt the conclusion of the service, at the moment when the priest\npronounced the words: "May the blessing of the Lord our God be upon\nyou," I seemed to feel within me, instantaneously communicated to all my\nbeing, a sense of even, as it were, physical comfort, as if a current of\nlight and warmth had suddenly poured into my very heart.\n\nWhen the service was over, if the priest approached me to ask if he\nshould come to our house to celebrate vespers, and what hour would suit\nme, I thanked him with emotion for his offer, but told him that I would\ncome myself to the church either on foot or in the carriage.\n\n"So you will yourself take that trouble?" he asked.\n\nI could not answer, for fear of sinning from pride. Unless Macha was\nwith me, I sent the carriage home from the church, and returned on foot,\nalone, saluting humbly all whom I met, seeking occasion to assist them,\nto advise them, to sacrifice myself for them in some way; helping to\nlift a load or carry a child, or stepping aside into the mud to yield a\npassage.\n\nOne evening I heard our intendant, in making his report to Macha, say\nthat a peasant, Simon, had come to beg for some wood to make a coffin\nfor his daughter, and for a silver rouble to pay for the mortuary\nservice, and that his request had been complied with.\n\n"Are they so poor?" I enquired.\n\n"Very poor, my lady; they live without salt,"[F] replied the intendant.\n\nI was distressed, yet, at the same time, in a manner rejoiced to hear\nthis. Making Macha believe that I was going for a walk, I ran upstairs,\ntook all my money (it was very little, but it was all I had,) and,\nhaving made the sign of the cross, hurried off, across the terrace and\ngarden, to Simon\'s cottage in the village. It was at the end of the\nlittle cluster of houses, and, unseen by anyone, I approached the\nwindow, laid the money upon the sill and tapped gently. The door opened,\nsome one came out of the cottage and called to me; but I, cold and\ntrembling with fear like a criminal, ran away home. Macha asked where I\nhad been, what was the matter with me? But I did not even understand\nwhat she was saying, and made no reply.\n\nEverything at this moment appeared to me so small, and of so little\nconsequence! I shut myself up in my chamber, and walked up and down\nthere alone, for a long time, not feeling disposed to do anything, to\nthink anything, and incapable of analyzing my own sensations. I imagined\nthe delight of the whole family, and what they would all say about the\nperson who had placed the money upon their window, and I began to regret\nthat I had not given it to them myself. I wondered what Sergius\nMikailovitch would have said, if he had known what I had done, and I was\ndelighted to think that he never would know it. And I was so seized with\njoy, so filled with a sense of the imperfection in myself and in all,\nyet so inclined to view with gentleness all these others, as well as\nmyself, that the thought of death offered itself to me as a vision of\nbliss. I smiled, I prayed, I wept, and at this instant I suddenly loved\nevery creature in the world, and I loved myself with a strange ardor.\nSearching my prayer-book, I read many passages from the Gospel, and all\nthat I read in this volume became more and more intelligible; the story\nof that divine life, appeared to me more touching and simple, while the\ndepth of feeling and of thought revealed to me, in this reading, became\nmore terrible and impenetrable. And how clear and easy everything\nseemed, when, on laying aside the book, I looked at my life and\nmeditated upon it. It seemed impossible not to live aright, and very\nsimple to love every one and to be loved by every one. Besides, every\none was good and gentle to me, even Sonia, whom I continued to teach,\nand who had become totally different, who really made an effort to\nunderstand, and to satisfy me, and give me no annoyance. What I was\ntrying to be to others, others were to me.\n\nPassing then to my enemies, from whom I must obtain forgiveness before\nthe great day, I could not think of any except one young lady in the\nneighborhood, whom I had laughed at before some company, about a year\nbefore, and who had ceased to visit at our house. I wrote a letter to\nher, acknowledging my fault, and begging her pardon. She responded by\nfully granting it, and asking mine in return. I shed tears of pleasure\nwhile reading these frank lines, which seemed to me full of deep and\ntouching sentiment. My maid wept when I asked her pardon also. Why were\nthey all so good to me? How had I deserved so much affection? I asked\nmyself. Involuntarily I began to think about Sergius Mikailovitch. I\ncould not help it, and besides I did not consider it a light or\nfrivolous diversion. True I was not thinking about him at all as I had\ndone on that night when, for the first time, I found out that I loved\nhim; I was thinking of him just as of myself, linking him, in spite of\nmyself, with every plan and idea of my future. The dominating influence\nwhich his presence had exercised over me, faded away completely in my\nimagination. I felt myself to-day his equal, and, from the summit of the\nideal edifice whence I was looking down, I had full comprehension of\nhim. Whatever in him had previously appeared strange to me was now\nintelligible. To-day, for the first time, I could appreciate the thought\nhe had expressed to me, that happiness consists in living for others,\nand to-day I felt in perfect unison with him. It appeared to me that we\ntwo were to enjoy a calm and illimitable happiness. No thought entered\nmy mind of journeys to foreign lands, guests at home, excitement, stir,\nand gayety; it was to be a peaceful existence, a home life in the\ncountry, perpetual abnegation of one\'s own will, perpetual love for\neach other, perpetual and absolute thankfulness to a loving and helpful\nProvidence.\n\nI concluded my devotions, as I had purposed, upon the anniversary of my\nbirth. My heart was so overflowing with happiness, that day, when I\nreturned from church, that there resulted all kinds of dread of life,\nfear of every feeling, terrors of whatever might disturb this happiness.\nBut we had scarcely descended from the droschky to the steps before the\nhouse, when I heard the well-known sound of his cabriolet upon the\nbridge, and in a moment Sergius Mikailovitch was with us. He offered me\nhis congratulations, and we went into the drawing-room together. Never\nsince I had known him, had I found myself so calm, so independent in his\npresence, as upon this morning. I felt that I bore within myself an\nentire new world, which he did not comprehend and which was superior to\nhim. I did not feel the least agitation in his society. He may, however,\nhave understood what was passing within me, for his gentleness to me was\npeculiarly delicate, almost, as it were, a religious deference. I was\ngoing towards the piano, but he locked it and put the key in his pocket,\nsaying:\n\n"Do not spoil the state of mind I see you are in; there is sounding, at\nthis moment, in the depths of your soul, a music which no harmony of\nthis earth can approach!"\n\nI was grateful to him for this thought, yet, at the same time, it was a\nlittle displeasing to me that he should thus understand, too easily, and\ntoo clearly, what was to remain secret from all, in the kingdom of my\nsoul.\n\nAfter dinner he said that he had come to bring me his congratulations\nand to say farewell, as he was going to Moscow on the following day. He\nwas looking at Macha when he said this, but he gave me a quick\nside-glance as if he was afraid of noticing some emotion upon my\ncountenance. But I showed neither surprise nor agitation, and did not\neven ask if his absence would be long. I knew that he said so, but I\nknew that he was not going. How? I cannot, now, explain it in the least;\nbut on this memorable day it appeared to me that I knew all that had\nbeen, and all that would be. I was in a mood akin to one of those happy\ndreams, where one has a kind of luminous vision of both the future and\nthe past.\n\nHe had intended going immediately after dinner, but Macha had left the\ntable, to take her siesta, and he was obliged to wait until she awoke in\norder to take leave of her.\n\nThe sun was shining full into the drawing-room, and we went out upon the\nterrace. We were scarcely seated, when I entered upon the conversation\nwhich was to decide the fate of my love. I began to speak, neither\nsooner nor later, but at the first moment that found us face to face\nalone, when nothing else had been said, when nothing had stolen into the\ntone and general character of the conversation which might hinder or\nembarrass what I wished to say. I cannot myself comprehend whence came\nthe calmness, the resolution, the precision of my words. One would have\nsaid that it was not I who was talking, and that something--I know not\nwhat--independent of my own volition, was making me speak. He was\nseated opposite to me, and, having drawn down to him a branch of lilac,\nbegan to pluck off its leaves. When I opened my lips, he let go the\nlittle branch, and covered his face with his hand. This might be the\nattitude of a man who was perfectly calm, or that of a man yielding to\ngreat agitation.\n\n"Why are you going away?" I began, in a resolute tone; then stopped, and\nlooked him straight in the eyes.\n\nHe did not reply at once.\n\n"Business!" he articulated, looking down on the ground.\n\nI saw that it was difficult for him to dissemble in answering a question\nI put so frankly.\n\n"Listen," said I, "you know what this day is to me. In many ways it is a\ngreat day. If I question you, it is not only to show my interest in you\n(you know I am used to you, and fond of you), I question you because I\nmust know. Why are you going away?"\n\n"It is excessively difficult to tell you the truth, to tell you why I am\ngoing away. During this week I have thought a great deal of you and of\nmyself, and I have decided that it is necessary for me to go. You\nunderstand ... why? And if you love me, do not question me!"\n\nHe passed his hand across his brow, and, covering his eyes again with\nthe same hand, he added:\n\n"This is painful to me.... But you understand, Katia!"\n\nMy heart began to beat hard in my breast.\n\n"I cannot understand," said I, "_I cannot do it_; but _you_, speak to\nme, in the name of God, in the name of this day, speak to me, I can hear\neverything calmly."\n\nHe changed his attitude, looked at me, and caught the branch of lilac\nagain.\n\n"Well," he resumed, after a moment\'s silence, in a voice which vainly\nstruggled to appear firm, "though it may be absurd, and almost\nimpossible to translate into words, and though it will cost me much, I\nwill try to explain to you;"--and as he uttered the words there were\nlines on his brow, as if he was suffering physical pain.\n\n"Go on," I said.\n\n"You must suppose there is a gentleman,--A. we will call him,--old,\nweary of existence; and a lady,--Madame B. we will say,--young, happy,\nand as yet knowing neither the world nor life. In consequence of family\nrelations A. loved B. like a daughter, with no fear of coming to love\nher differently."\n\nHe was silent, and I did not interrupt him.\n\n"But," he suddenly pursued, in a brief, resolute voice, without looking\nat me, "he had forgotten that B. was young, that for her life was still\nbut a game, that it might easily happen that he might love her, and that\nB. might amuse herself with him. He deceived himself, and one fine day\nhe found that another feeling, weighty to bear as remorse, had stolen\ninto his soul, and he was startled. He dreaded to see their old friendly\nrelations thus compromised, and he decided to go away before these had\ntime to change their nature."\n\nAs he spoke, he again with seeming carelessness passed his hand across\nhis eyes, and covered them.\n\n"And why did he fear to love differently?" I said, presently, in a\nsteady voice, controlling my emotion; but no doubt this seemed to him\nmere playful banter, for he answered with the air of a deeply wounded\nman:\n\n"You are young; I am no longer so. Playing may please you, for me more\nis necessary. Only, do not play with me, for I assure you it will do me\nno good,--and you might find it weigh on your conscience! That is what\nA. said," he added,--"but all this is nonsense; you understand, now, why\nI am going; let us say no more about it, I beg you...."\n\n"Yes, yes, let us speak of it!" said I, and tears made my voice tremble.\n"Did she love him or not?"\n\nHe did not reply.\n\n"And if he did not love her," I continued, "why did he play with her as\nif she were a child?"\n\n"Yes, yes, A. had been culpable," he replied interrupting me; "but all\nthat is over, and they have parted from each other ... good friends!"\n\n"But this is frightful! And is there no other end?" I exclaimed,\nterrified at what I was saying.\n\n"Yes, there is one." And he uncovered his agitated face, and looked at\nme steadily. "There are even two other ends, quite different. But, for\nthe love of God, do not interrupt me, and listen to me quietly. Some\nsay," he went on, rising, and giving a forced, sad smile, "some say that\nA. went mad, that he loved B. with an insane love, and that he told her\nso.... But that she only laughed at him. For her the matter had been but\na jest, a trifle; for him,--the one thing in his life!"\n\nI shivered, and would have broken in, to tell him that he should not\ndare to speak for me; but he stopped me, and, laying his hand upon mine:\n\n"Wait!" he said, in a shaking voice: "others say that she was sorry for\nhim, that she fancied--poor little girl, knowing nothing of the\nworld--that she might actually love him, and that she consented to be\nhis wife. And he--madman--he believed,--believed that all his life was\nbeginning again; but she herself became conscious that she was\ndeceiving him and that he was deceiving her.... Let us talk no more\nabout it!" he concluded, indeed evidently incapable of farther speech,\nand he silently sat down again opposite me.\n\nHe had said, "Let us talk no more about it," but it was manifest that\nwith all the strength of his soul he was waiting for a word from me.\nIndeed I tried to speak, and could not; something stopped my breath. I\nlooked at him, he was pale, and his lower lip was trembling. I was very\nsorry for him. I made another effort, and suddenly succeeding in\nbreaking the silence which paralyzed me. I said, in a slow, concentrated\nvoice, fearing every moment it would fail me:\n\n"There is a third end to the story" (I stopped, but he remained silent),\n"and this other end is that he did not love her, that he hurt her, hurt\nher cruelly, that he believed he was right to do it, that he ... that he\nwent away, and that, moreover, moreover, he was proud of it. It is not\non my side, but on yours, that the trifling has been, from the first day\nI loved you; I loved you," I repeated, and at the word "loved" my voice\ninvoluntarily changed from its tone of slow concentration to a kind of\nwild cry which appalled myself.\n\nHe was standing up before me, very pale, his lip trembled more and more,\nand I saw two heavy tears making their way down his cheeks.\n\n"This is dreadful!"--I could barely get out the words, choked with anger\nand unshed tears.--"And why?..." I jumped up hastily, to run away.\n\nBut he sprang towards me. In a moment his head was upon my knees, my\ntrembling hands were pressed again and again to his lips, and I felt hot\ndrops falling upon them.\n\n"My God, if I had known!" he was murmuring.\n\n"Why? why?" I repeated mechanically, my soul in the grasp of that\ntransport which seizes, possesses, and flies forever, that rapture which\nreturns no more.\n\nFive minutes afterwards, Sonia went dashing upstairs to Macha, and all\nover the house, crying out that Katia was going to marry Sergius\nMikailovitch.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\nThere was no reason to delay our marriage, and neither he nor I desired\nto do so. It is true that Macha longed to go to Moscow to order my\ntrousseau, and Sergius\' mother considered it incumbent upon him before\nmarrying to buy a new carriage and more furniture and have the whole\nhouse renovated, but we both insisted that this could all be done quite\nas well afterwards, and that we would be married at the end of the\nfortnight succeeding my birthday, without trousseau, parade, guests,\ngroomsmen, supper, champagne, or any of the traditional attributes of a\nwedding. He told me that his mother was unwilling to have the great\nevent take place without the music, the avalanche of trunks, the\nrefurnished house, which, at a cost of thirty thousand roubles, had\naccompanied her own marriage; and how, without his knowledge, she had\nransacked for treasures all the chests in the lumber rooms, and held\nsober consultations with Mariouchka, the housekeeper, on the subject of\ncertain new carpets and curtains, quite indispensable to our happiness.\nOn our side, Macha was similarly employed, with my maid Kouzminicha. She\ncould not be laughed out of this; being firmly persuaded that when\nSergius and I ought to have been discussing our future arrangements, we\nwasted our time in soft speeches (as was perhaps natural in our\nposition); while of course, in fact, the very substance of our future\nhappiness was dependent upon the cut and embroidery of my dresses, and\nthe straight hems on our table-cloths and napkins. Between Pokrovski and\nNikolski, every day and several times a day, mysterious communications\nwere exchanged as to the progressing preparations; and though apparently\nMacha and the bridegroom\'s mother were upon the tenderest terms, one\nfelt sure of the constant passage of shafts of keen and hostile\ndiplomacy between the two powers.\n\nTatiana Semenovna, his mother, with whom I now became more fully\nacquainted, was a woman of the old school, starched and stiff, and a\nsevere mistress. Sergius loved her, not only from duty as a son, but\nalso with the sentiment of a man who saw in her the best, the most\nintelligent, the tenderest, and the most amiable woman in the world.\nTatiana had always been cordial and kind to us, particularly to me, and\nshe was delighted that her son should marry; but as soon as I became\nbetrothed to him it appeared to me that she wished to make me feel that\nhe might have made a better match, and that I ought never to forget the\nfact. I perfectly understood her, and was entirely of her opinion.\n\nDuring these last two weeks, Sergius and I saw each other every day; he\nalways dined with us and remained until midnight; but, though he often\ntold me--and I knew he was telling the truth--that he could not now live\nwithout me, yet he never spent the whole day with me, and even, after a\nfashion, continued to attend to his business matters. Our outward\nrelations, up to the very time of our marriage, were exactly what they\nhad been; we still said "_you_" to each other, he did not even kiss my\nhand, and not only did he not seek, but he actually avoided occasions of\nfinding himself alone with me, as if he feared giving himself up too\nmuch to the great and dangerous love he bore in his heart.\n\nAll these days the weather was bad, and we spent most of them in the\ndrawing-room; our conversations being held in the corner between the\npiano and the window.\n\n"Do you know that there is one thing I have been wishing to say to you\nfor a long time?" he said, late one evening, when we were alone in our\ncorner. "I have been thinking of it, all the time you have been at the\npiano."\n\n"Tell me nothing, I know all," I replied.\n\n"Well then, we will say no more about it."\n\n"Oh, yes, indeed, tell me; what is it?" I asked.\n\n"It is this. You remember me telling you that story about A. and B.?"\n\n"As if I could help remembering that foolish story! How lucky that it\nhas ended so...."\n\n"A little more, and I would have destroyed my happiness with my own\nhand; you saved me; but the thing is, that I was not truthful with you,\nthen; it has been on my conscience, and now I wish to tell you all."\n\n"Ah, please do not!"\n\n"Do not be afraid," he said, smiling, "it is only that I must justify\nmyself. When I began to talk to you, I wished to debate the question."\n\n"Why debate?" said I, "that is never necessary."\n\nHe looked at me in silence, then went on.\n\n"In regard to the end of that story,--what I said to you, then, was not\nnonsense; clearly there was something to fear, and I was right to fear\nit. To receive everything from you, and give you so little! You are yet\na child, yet an unexpanded flower, you love for the first time, while\nI...."\n\n"Oh, yes, tell me the truth!" I exclaimed. But all at once I was afraid\nof his answer. "No, do not tell me!" I added.\n\n"Whether I have loved before? is that it?" he said, instantly divining\nmy thought. "It is easy to tell you that. No, I have not loved. Never\nhas such a feeling.... So, do you not see how imperative it was for me\nto reflect, before telling you that I loved you? What am I giving you?\nLove, it is true...."\n\n"Is that so little?" I asked, looking into his face.\n\n"Yes, that is little, my darling, little for you. You have beauty and\nyouth. Often, at night, I cannot sleep for happiness; I am incessantly\nthinking how we are going to live together. I have already lived much,\nyet it seems to me that I have but just now come to the knowledge of\nwhat makes happiness. A sweet, tranquil life, in our retired corner,\nwith the possibility of doing good to those to whom it is so easy to do\nit, and who, nevertheless, are so little used to it; then work,--work,\nwhence, you know, some profit always springs; recreation, also, nature,\nbooks, music, the affection of some congenial friend; there is my\nhappiness, a happiness higher than I ever dreamed of. And beyond all\nthat, a loved one like you, perhaps a family; in one word, all that a\nman can desire in this world!"\n\n"Yes," said I.\n\n"For me, whose youth is done, yes; but for you ..." he continued. "You\nhave not yet lived; perhaps you might have wished to pursue your\nhappiness in some other path, and in some other path perhaps you might\nhave found it. At present it seems to you that what I speak of is indeed\nhappiness, because you love me...."\n\n"No, I have never desired nor liked any but this sweet home life. And\nyou have just said precisely what I think, myself."\n\nHe smiled.\n\n"It seems so to you, my darling. But that is little for you. You have\nbeauty and youth," he repeated, thoughtfully.\n\nI was beginning to feel provoked at seeing that he would not believe me,\nand that in a certain way he was reproaching me with my beauty and my\nyouth.\n\n"Come now, why do you love me?" I asked, rather hotly: "for my youth or\nfor myself?"\n\n"I do not know, but I do love," he replied, fixing upon me an observant\nlook, full of alluring sweetness.\n\nI made no response, but involuntarily met his eyes. All at once, a\nstrange thing happened to me. I ceased to see what was around me, his\nface itself disappeared from before me, and I could distinguish nothing\nbut the fire of the eyes exactly opposite mine; then it seemed to me\nthat these eyes themselves were piercing into me, then all became\nconfused, I could no longer see anything at all, and I was obliged to\nhalf close my eyelids to free myself from the mingled sensation of joy\nand terror produced by this look.\n\nTowards evening of the day previous to that appointed for our marriage,\nthe weather cleared. After the heavy continuous rains of the summer we\nhad the first brilliant autumnal sunset. The sky was pure, rigid, and\npale. I went to sleep, happy in the thought that the next day would be\nbright, for our wedding. I woke in the morning with the sun upon me, and\nwith the thought that here already was the day ... as if it astonished\nand frightened me. I went to the garden. The sun had just risen, and was\nshining through the linden-trees, whose yellow leaves were floating down\nand strewing the paths. There was not one cloud to be seen in the cold\nserene sky.\n\n"Is it possible that it is to-day?" I asked myself, not venturing to\nbelieve in my own happiness. "Is it possible that to-morrow I shall not\nwake here, that I shall open my eyes in that house of Nikolski, with its\ncolumns, in a place now all strange to me! Is it possible that\nhenceforward I shall not be expecting him, shall not be going to meet\nhim, shall not talk about him any more in the evenings, with Macha?\nShall I no longer sit at the piano in our drawing-room at Pokrovski,\nwith him beside me? Shall I no longer see him go away, and tremble with\nfear for him because the night is dark?" But I remembered that he had\ntold me, the night before, that it was his last visit; and, besides,\nMacha had made me try on my wedding-dress. So that, by moments, I would\nbelieve, and then doubt again. Was it really true that this very day I\nwas to begin to live with a mother-in-law, without Nadine, without old\nGregory, without Macha? That at night I would not embrace my old nurse,\nand hear her say, making the sign of the cross, as she always did;\n"Good-night, my young lady?" That I would no longer hear Sonia\'s\nlessons, or play with her, or rap on the partition wall in the morning\nand hear her gay laugh? Was it possible that it was really to-day that I\nwas to become, in a measure, an alien to myself, and that a new life,\nrealizing my hopes and my wishes, was opening before me? And was it\npossible that this new life, just beginning, was to be for ever? I\nwaited impatiently for Sergius, so hard it was for me to remain alone\nwith these thoughts. He came early, and it was only when he was actually\nthere that I was sure that to-day I was really going to be his wife, and\nno longer felt frightened at the thought.\n\nBefore dinner we went to church, to hear the service for the dead, in\ncommemoration of my father.\n\n"Oh, if he were still in this world!" thought I, as I was returning\nhome, leaning silently on the arm of the man who had been his dearest\nfriend. While the prayers were being read, kneeling with my brow pressed\nupon the cold flag-stones of the chapel floor, my father had been so\nvividly brought before my mind, that I could not help believing that he\ncomprehended me and blessed my choice, and I imagined that, at the\nmoment, his soul was hovering above us, and that his benediction rested\nupon me. These remembrances, these hopes, my happiness and my regrets,\nblended within me into a feeling at once solemn and sweet, which seemed,\nas it were, to be set in a frame of clear quiet air, stillness, bare\nfields, pale heavens whose brilliant but enfeebled rays vainly strove to\nbring the color to my cheek. I persuaded myself that my companion was\nunderstanding and sharing my feelings. He walked with slow steps, in\nsilence, and his face, which I glanced into from time to time, bore the\nimpress of that intense state of the soul, which is neither sadness nor\njoy, and which perfectly harmonized with surrounding nature and with my\nheart.\n\nAll at once, he turned towards me, and I saw that he had something to\nsay to me. What if he were not going to speak of what was in my\nthoughts? But without even naming him he spoke of my father, and added:\n\n"One day he happened to say to me, laughingly, \'You will marry my little\nKatia!\'"\n\n"How glad he would have been, to-day," I responded, pressing closer to\nthe arm on which I leaned.\n\n"Yes, you were then but a child," he went on, looking deep into my eyes;\n"I kissed those eyes and loved them simply because they were so like\nhis, and I was far from thinking that one day they would be so dear to\nme in themselves."\n\nWe were still walking slowly along the field-path, scarcely traceable\namong the trodden and scattered stubble, and heard no sound save our own\nfootsteps and voices. The sun poured down floods of light that gave no\nwarmth. When we spoke, our voices seemed to resound and hang suspended\nabove our heads in the motionless atmosphere. We might have thought we\ntwo were alone upon the earth, alone beneath that blue vault vibrating\nwith cold scintillations from the sun.\n\nWhen we arrived at the house, we found his mother already there, with\nthe few guests whom we had felt obliged to invite, and I was not again\nalone with him until we had left the church and were in the carriage on\nour way to Nikolski.\n\nThe church had been almost empty. At one glance I had seen his mother,\nstanding near the choir; Macha, with her wet cheeks and lilac\ncap-ribbons; and two or three _drorovies_, who were gazing at me with\ncurious eyes. I heard the prayers, I repeated them, but they had no\nmeaning for me. I could not pray, myself, I only kept looking stupidly\nat the images, the wax tapers, the cross embroidered on the chasuble the\npriest had on, the iconostase, the church windows, but did not seem able\nto understand anything at all; I only felt that something very\nextraordinary was being done to me. When the priest turned towards us\nwith the cross, when he gave us his congratulations, and said that he\nhad baptized me and that now God had permitted him also to marry me;\nwhen Macha and Sergius\' mother embraced us, when I heard Gregory\'s voice\ncalling the carriage, I was astonished and frightened at the thought\nthat all was finished, though no marvellous change, corresponding with\nthe sacrament which had just been performed over me, had taken place in\nmy soul. We kissed each other, and this kiss appeared to me so odd, so\nout of keeping with ourselves, that I could not help thinking: "It is\nonly _that_?" We went out upon the parvise, the noise of the wheels\nechoed loudly within the arch of the church; I felt the fresh air upon\nmy face, and was conscious that, Sergius with his hat under his arm, had\nassisted me into the carriage. Through the window I saw that the moon\nwas shining in her place in the frosty sky. He took his seat beside me,\nand shut the door. Something, at this moment, seemed to strike through\nmy heart, as if the assurance with which he did this had given me a\nwound. The wheels glanced against a stone, then began to revolve upon\nthe smooth road, and we were gone. Drawn back into a corner of the\ncarriage, I watched the fields flooded with light, and the flying road.\nNevertheless, without looking at him, I was feeling that there he was,\nbeside me. "Here, then, is all that this first moment from which I have\nexpected so much, brings me?" I thought, and all at once I had a sense\nof humiliation and offence at finding myself seated thus alone with him\nand so close to him. I turned towards him, intending to say something,\nno matter what. But no word would come from my lips; one would have said\nthat no trace of my former tenderness lingered within my heart, but that\nit was entirely replaced by this impression of alarm and offence.\n\n"Up to this moment, I still dared not believe that this might be!" he\nsoftly responded to my glance.\n\n"And I ... I am afraid ... I know not why!"\n\n"Afraid of me, Katia?" he said, taking my hand, and bending his head\nover it.\n\nMy hand rested within his, lifeless; my heart stopped beating.\n\n"Yes," I murmured.\n\nBut, at the same moment, my heart suddenly began to beat again, my hand\ntrembled and clasped his, warmth returned to me; my eyes, in the dim\nlight, sought his eyes, and I felt, all at once, that I was no longer\nafraid of him; that this terror had been but a new love, yet more tender\nand strong than the old. I knew that I was wholly his, and that I was\nhappy to be wholly in his power.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\nThe days, the weeks, two entire months of lonely country life slipped\naway, imperceptibly, it appeared to us; but the sensations, the\nemotions, and the happiness of these two months would have sufficed to\nfill a whole life. My dreams, and his, concerning the mode of organizing\nour joint existence were not realized exactly as we had anticipated.\nBut, nevertheless, the reality was not below our dreams. This was not\nthe life of strict industry, full of duties, abnegation, and sacrifices,\nwhich I had pictured to myself when I became his betrothed; on the\ncontrary, it was the absorbing and egotistical sentiment of love, joys\nwithout reason and without end, oblivion of everything in the world. He\nwould, it is true, sometimes retire to his study and occupy himself with\nsomething demanding attention; sometimes he went to the city on\nbusiness, or overlooked his agricultural matters; but I could see how\nhard it was for him to tear himself away from me. Indeed, he himself\nsaid that whenever I was not present, things appeared to him so devoid\nof interest that the wonder was that he could attend to them at all. It\nwas precisely the same on my side. I read, I busied myself with my\nmusic, with Mamma, with the schools; but I only did so because all these\nemployments were in some way connected with him, and met with his\napprobation, and the instant the thought of him ceased to be in some\nmanner, direct or indirect, associated with anything whatever that I was\ndoing, I would stop doing it. To me, he was the only person in the\nuniverse, the handsomest, noblest human being in the wide world; of\ncourse, therefore, I could live for nothing but him, could strive for\nnothing but to remain in his eyes what he considered me. For he honestly\nconsidered me the first and highest of women, gifted with every\nexcellence and charm; and my one aim was to be in reality for him this\nhighest and most complete of all existing creatures.\n\nOurs was one of those old country homes, where generation after\ngeneration of ancestors had lived, loved each other, and peacefully\npassed away. The very walls seemed to breathe out happy household\nmemories, and no sooner had I set my foot upon the threshold, than these\nall appeared to become memories of my own. The arrangement and order of\nthe dwelling were old-fashioned, carefully kept so by Tatiania\nSemenovna. No one could have said that anything was handsome or elegant,\nbut everything, from the attendance to the furniture and the food, was\nproper, solid, regular, and seemed to inspire respect. In the\ndrawing-room, tables, chairs, and divans were symmetrically ranged, the\nwalls were hidden by family portraits, and the floor was covered with\nancient rugs and immense landscapes in linen. In the small parlor there\nwas an old grand piano, two chiffoniers of different shapes, a divan,\nand one or two tables decorated with wrought copper. My private room,\nadorned by Tatiana Semenovna, was honored with all the finest pieces of\nfurniture, irrespective of varying styles and dates, and, among the\nrest, with an old mirror with doors, which at first I hardly dared to\nraise my eyes to, but which afterwards became like a dear old friend to\nme. Tatiana\'s voice was never heard, but the household went on with the\nregularity of a well-wound clock, although there were many more servants\nthan were necessary. But all these servants, wearing their soft heelless\nslippers (for Tatiana Semenovna insisted that creaking soles and\npounding heels were, of all things in the world, the most disagreeable),\nall these servants appeared proud of their condition, trembling before\nthe old lady, showing to my husband and me a protecting good-will, and\nseeming to take special satisfaction in the discharge of their\nrespective duties. Every Saturday, regularly, the floors were scoured,\nand the carpets shaken; on the first day of every month, a _Te Deum_ was\nchanted, and holy water sprinkled; while upon every recurring fete-day\nof Tatiana Semenovna and her son, and now also upon mine (which took\nplace this autumn, for the first time), a feast was given to all the\nneighborhood. And all this was performed precisely as in the oldest\ntimes that Tatiana Semenovna could remember.\n\nMy husband interfered in nothing concerning the management of the house,\nconfining himself to the control of the estate, and the affairs of the\npeasants, which fully occupied him.\n\nHe rose very early, even during the winter, so that he was always gone\nwhen I woke. He generally returned for tea, which we took alone\ntogether; and at these times, having finished the troubles and\nannoyances of his agricultural matters, he would often fall into that\nparticularly joyous light-hearted state of mind, which we used to call\n_le transport sauvage_. Often, when I asked him to tell me what he had\nbeen doing all the morning, he would relate such perfectly absurd\nadventures, that we would almost die of laughing; sometimes when I\ndemanded a sober account, he would give it to me, making an effort to\nrestrain even a smile. As for me, I watched his eyes, or the motion of\nhis lips, and did not understand a word he said, being entirely taken up\nwith the pleasure of looking at him and hearing his voice.\n\n"Come, now, what was I saying?" he would ask; "repeat it to me!"\n\nBut I never could repeat any of it.\n\nTatiana Semenovna never made her appearance until dinner time, taking\nher tea alone, and only sending an ambassador to wish us good-morning. I\nalways found it hard not to burst out laughing, when the maid entered,\ntook her stand before us with her hands crossed one upon the other, and,\nin her measured tones informed us that Tatiana Semenovna desired to know\nwhether we had slept well, and whether we liked the little cakes we had\nfor tea. Until dinner time we seldom remained together. I played, or\nread, alone; he wrote, or sometimes went out again; but at four o\'clock\nwe went down to the drawing-room for dinner. Mamma came out of her\nchamber, and then the poor gentle-folk and pilgrims who happened to be\nlodging in the house, usually two or three in number made their\nappearance. Regularly every day my husband, following the ancient\ncustom, offered his arm to his mother, to conduct her to the\ndining-room, and she requested him to take me upon his other arm. Mamma\npresided at dinner, and the conversation was of a serious, thoughtful\nturn, not altogether without a shade of solemnity. The simple every-day\ntalk between my husband and myself was the only agreeable diversion in\nthe grave aspect of these table sessions. After dinner, Mamma took her\nseat in a large arm-chair in the salon, and cut open the leaves of any\nnewly-arrived books; we read aloud, or went to the piano in the small\ndrawing-room. We read a great deal together during those two months, but\nmusic continued to be our supreme enjoyment, for every day it seemed to\nstrike some new chord in our hearts, whose vibrations revealed us to\neach other more and more wholly. When I was playing his favorite airs he\nretired to a divan at some distance, where I could scarcely see him, and\nwith a kind of modesty of sentiment tried to conceal from me the emotion\nmy music produced; but, often, when he least expected it, I rose from\nthe piano and ran to him, to try to surprise upon his countenance the\ntraces of this deep feeling and to catch the almost supernatural light\nin the humid eyes which he vainly strove to conceal from me. I presided\nover our late tea in the large drawing-room, again all the family were\ngathered round the table, and for a long time this formal assembling\nnear the samovar, as in a tribunal, with the distribution of the cups\nand glasses, discomposed me very much. It always seemed to me that I was\nnot yet worthy of these honors, that I was too young, too giddy, to turn\nthe faucet of that stately samovar, set the cups on Nikita\'s tray and\nsay: "For Peter Ivanovitch; for Maria Minichna," and ask: "Is it sweet\nenough?" And afterwards give out the lumps of sugar for the white-haired\nnurse and the other old servants. "Perfect, perfect," my husband would\noften tell me; "quite a grown-up person!" and then I would feel more\nintimidated than ever.\n\nAfter tea Mamma played patience, or she and Maria Minichna had a game of\ncards together; then she embraced us both and gave us her blessing, and\nwe withdrew to our own apartment. There, however, our evening\n_tete-a-tete_ was usually prolonged until midnight, for these were our\npleasantest hours in the twenty-four. He told me about his past life, we\nmade plans, occasionally we philosophized, all the time talking in a low\ntone lest we might be overheard. We lived, he and I, almost upon the\nfooting of strangers in this huge old house, where everything seemed to\nbe weighed upon by the severe spirit of ancient times and of Tatiana\nSemenovna. Not only she herself, but also the servants, all these old\nmen and women, the furniture, the pictures, all inspired me with respect\nand a kind of fear, and at the same time with the consciousness that my\nhusband and I were not exactly in our own place there and that our\nconduct must be extremely circumspect. As well as I remember, now, this\nsevere order and the prodigious number of idle, inquisitive men and\nwomen about our house were very hard to bear: but even this sense of\noppression only served to vivify our mutual love. Not only I, but he\nalso, made an effort not to let it be seen that anything in our home was\ndispleasing to us. Sometimes this calmness, this indulgence, this\nseeming indifference to everything, irritated me, and I could not help\nlooking upon such conduct as weakness, and telling him so.\n\n"Ah, dear Katia," he replied, once, when I was expressing my annoyance,\n"how can a man show that anything, no matter what, is displeasing to\nhim, when he is as happy as I am? It is a great deal easier to yield,\nthan to make them yield, I have long been convinced of that,--and,\nmoreover, of the fact there is no situation where one cannot be happy.\nEverything goes so well with us! I do not even know, any longer, how to\nget angry; for me, just now, there is nothing at all that is bad, there\nare only things that are either dull or droll. But, above all, \'let well\nenough alone.\' You may hardly believe me, but whenever I hear a ring at\nthe door-bell, whenever I receive a letter, actually whenever I wake in\nthe morning, a fear takes hold of me, fear of the obligations of life,\nfear that something may be going to change; for nothing could be better\nthan this present moment!"\n\nI believed him, but I could not understand him. I was happy, but it\nseemed to me that all was as it ought to be, and could not be otherwise;\nthat it was the same with every one else, and that somewhere there were\nother joys still, not greater ones, but quite different.\n\nThus two months passed by, bringing us to the cold, stormy winter, and\nalthough he was with me, I began to feel somewhat alone; I began to feel\nthat life was doing nothing but repeating itself, as it were; that it\noffered nothing new either for me or for him; that, on the contrary, we\nseemed to be forever treading over and over again in our own footsteps.\nHe was more frequently occupied with business matters away from me, than\nhe had been at first, and once more I had the old feeling that far down\nin his soul lay a world, hidden and reserved, to which he would not\nadmit me. His unalterable serenity irritated me. I loved him no less\nthan formerly, was no less happy in his love; but my love remained\nstationary and did not seem to grow any more, and besides this love a\nnew sentiment, full of anxiety, came creeping into my heart. Continuing\nto love seemed to me so small a thing after that great transport of\nfirst loving him; I felt as if my sentiments ought to include agitation,\ndanger, sacrifice of myself. There were in me exuberant forces finding\nno employment in our tranquil existence, fits of depression which I\nsought to conceal from him as something wicked, fits of impetuous\ntenderness and gaiety which only alarmed him. He still had his old habit\nof watching me and studying my moods, and one day he came to me with a\nproposal to move to the city for a time; but I begged him not to go, not\nto alter anything whatever in our mode of life, not to touch our\nhappiness. And, really and truly, I was happy; but I was tormenting\nmyself because this happiness brought me no labor, no sacrifice, while,\nI felt all the powers of sacrifice and labor dying away within me. I\nloved him, I knew that I was entirely his; but I wished every one to see\nour love, wished that some one would try to prevent my loving him,--and\nthen to love him all the same! My mind, and even my sentiments, found\ntheir field of action, but yet there was something--the sense of youth,\nwith its need of movement--which had no sufficient satisfaction in our\nplacid life. Why did he tell me that we could go to the city whenever\nthe fancy seized me to do so? If he had not said this, perhaps I might\nhave understood that the feeling which oppressed me was a pernicious\nchimera, a fault of which I was guilty.... But the thought kept coming\ninto my head that simply by going to the city, I could escape from my\nennui; but then, on the other hand, this would be withdrawing him from a\nlife that he loved; I was ashamed to do this, but it cost me something\nnot to do it.\n\nTime went on, the snow piled higher and higher against the walls of the\nhouse, and we were always alone, still alone, always with each other,\nwhile away yonder,--I knew not where, but yonder somewhere,--in stir and\nmotion, in splendor and excitement, was the crowd, feeling, suffering,\nrejoicing, amusing itself, without one thought of us and our vanished\nexistence. Worst of all to me was the consciousness that day by day the\nchain of habit was binding and pressing our life closer into its narrow\nmould, that our love itself would enter into bondage and become subject\nto the monotonous and dispassionate law of time. To be cheerful in the\nmorning, respectful at dinner, affectionate in the evening! "To do\ngood!" I said to myself, it is all very well and admirable to do good,\nand to live a worthy life, as he says; but we have yet time enough for\nthat; there are other things for which, to-day, I feel powers within me.\nThis is not what I wanted; what I wanted was combat, struggle; was to\nfeel that love is our guide in life, not that life guides our love. I\ncould have wished to draw near to the abyss with him, to say to him:\n"One more step, and I dash myself down, one more movement and I perish;"\nhe, while paling on the brink of this abyss, he would have seized me\nwith his powerful hand, held me there suspended above the gulf, my heart\nfaint with fear,--and then he might have borne me whithersoever he\nwould!\n\nThis mood of my soul began to tell upon my health, my nerves began to\nbe out of order. One morning I felt even more upset than usual, and\nSergius returned home in rather a bad temper, which was an extremely\nrare occurrence with him; I noticed it at once, and asked him what was\nthe matter, but he would not tell me, only remarking that it was not\nworth while. As I afterwards learned, the ispravnik,[G] from ill-will to\nmy husband, had summoned several peasants, made some illegal exaction of\nthem, and had even uttered menaces against him. My husband had not yet\nbeen able to look into the matter and, moreover, as it was but a piece\nof absurd impertinence he had not cared to tell me of it; but I imagined\nthat his not telling me was because he considered me a child, and that\nin his eyes I was incapable of understanding what interested him. I\nturned from him in silence, without saying a word; he went into his\nstudy, gravely, and shut his door after him. When I could no longer hear\nhim, I sat down on a divan, almost crying. "Why," said I to myself,\n"does he persist in humiliating me by his solemn calmness, by being\nalways in the right? Am I not in the right also, when I am wearied, when\neverywhere I feel emptiness, when I long to live, to move, not to stay\nforever in one place and feel time walk over me? I wish to go onward,\neach day, each hour; I wish for something new, while he,--he wants to\nstand still in one spot, and keep me standing there with him! And yet\nhow easy it would be for him to satisfy me! He need not take me to the\ncity, it would only be necessary for him to be a little like me, for him\nto stop trying to constrain and crush himself with his own hands, for\nhim to live naturally. That is what he is always advising me, and it is\nhe who is not natural, that is all."\n\nI felt my tears getting the mastery of me, and my irritation against him\nincreasing. I was afraid of this irritation, and I went to find him. He\nwas sitting in his study, writing. Hearing my steps, he turned for an\ninstant, looked at me with a calm and indifferent air, and continued\nwriting; this look did not please me, and instead of going up to him, I\nstopped near the table where he was writing and, opening a book, began\nto run my eyes over the page. He turned then, a second time, and looked\nat me again:\n\n"Katia, you are not as bright as usual!"\n\nI only responded by a cold glance, meant to convey: "And why? And why so\nmuch amiability?" He shook his head at me, and smiled timidly and\ntenderly; but, for the first time, my smile would not answer his.\n\n"What was the matter with you this morning?" I asked, "why would you\ntell me nothing?"\n\n"It was a trifle! a slight worry," he replied. "I can tell you all about\nit, now. Two peasants had been summoned to the city...."\n\nBut I would not let him finish.\n\n"Why did you not tell me when I asked you?"\n\n"I might have said something foolish, I was angry then."\n\n"That was just the time to tell me."\n\n"And why so?"\n\n"What you think, then, is that I never can help you in anything?"\n\n"What I think?" said he, throwing down his pen. "I think that without\nyou I could not live. In all things, in all, not only are you a help to\nme, but it is by you that everything is done. You are literally to me\n\'well-fallen,\'" he went on smiling. "It is in you alone that I live; it\nseems to me nothing is good but because you are there, because you\nmust...."\n\n"Yes, I know it, I am a nice little child who has to be petted and kept\nquiet," said I, in such a tone that he looked at me in amazement. "But I\ndo not want this quieting; I have had enough of it!"\n\n"Come, let me tell you about this morning\'s trouble," he said hastily,\nas if he was afraid to give me time to say more: "let us see what you\nthink of it!"\n\n"I do not wish to hear it now," I replied.\n\nI really did want to hear it, but it was more agreeable to me, at this\nmoment, to disturb his tranquillity.\n\n"I do not wish to play with the things of life; I wish to live," I\nadded; "like you."\n\nHis face, which always so clearly and so readily reflected every\nimpression, wore a look of suffering and intense attention.\n\n"I wish to live with you in perfect equality...."\n\nBut I could not finish, such profound pain was on his face. He was\nsilent an instant.\n\n"And in what do you not live with me on a footing of equality?" he said:\n"it is I, not you, that is concerned in this affair of the ispravnik and\nsome drunken peasants."\n\n"Yes, but it is not only this case," said I.\n\n"For the love of God, do understand me, my darling," he continued; "I\nknow how painful a thing care is for us all; I have lived, and I know\nit. I love you, therefore I would spare you every care. My life is\ncentred in my love for you; so do not prevent my living!"\n\n"You are always right," said I, without looking at him.\n\nI could not bear to see him once more serene and tranquil, while I was\nso full of anger and a feeling somewhat resembling repentance.\n\n"Katia! What is the matter with you?" said he. "The question is not in\nthe least which of us two is in the right, what we were talking about is\nsomething entirely different! What have you against me? Do not tell me\nat once; reflect, and then tell me all that is in your thoughts. You are\ndispleased with me, you have, no doubt, a reason, but explain to me in\nwhat I am to blame."\n\nBut how could I tell him all that I had in the bottom of my heart? The\nthought that he had seen through me at once, that again I found myself\nas a child before him, that I could do nothing that he did not\ncomprehend and foresee, excited me more than ever.\n\n"I have nothing against you," said I, "but I am tired, and I do not like\nennui. You say that this must be so, and, of course, once more you are\nright!"\n\nAs I spoke, I looked in his face. My object was attained; his serenity\nhad disappeared; alarm and pain were stamped upon his face.\n\n"Katia!" he began, in a low, agitated voice, "this is no jesting we are\nengaged in, at this moment. Our fate is being decided. I ask you to say\nnothing, only to hear me. Why are you torturing me thus?"\n\nBut I broke in.\n\n"Say no more, you are right," said I, coldly, as if it were not I, but\nsome evil spirit speaking with my lips.\n\n"If you knew what you are doing!" he exclaimed in a trembling voice.\n\nI began to cry, and I felt my heart somewhat relieved. He was sitting\nnear me, silent. I was sorry for him, ashamed of myself, troubled by\nwhat I had done. I did not look at him. I felt sure that he was looking\nat me, and that his eyes were perplexed or severe. I turned; his eyes\nwere indeed fixed upon me, but they were kind and gentle and seemed\nentreating forgiveness. I took his hand, and said:\n\n"Pardon me! I do not know, myself, what I said."\n\n"Yes, but I know what you said, and I know that you spoke the truth."\n\n"What truth?" I asked.\n\n"That we must go to St. Petersburg. This is no longer the place for us."\n\n"As you wish."\n\nHe took me in his arms and kissed me.\n\n"You forgive me?" he said, "I have been to blame concerning you...."\n\nIn the evening I was at the piano a long time playing for him, while he\nwalked up and down the room, repeating something in a low tone to\nhimself. This was a habit with him, and I often asked him what he was\nmurmuring thus, and he, still thoughtful, would repeat it again to me;\ngenerally it was poetry, sometimes some really absurd thing, but even\nthe very absurdity would show me what frame of mind he was in.\n\n"What are you murmuring there, now?" I asked after a time.\n\nHe stood still, thought a little, then, smiling, repeated the two lines\nfrom Lermontoff:\n\n    "And he, the madman, invoked the tempest,\n     As if, in the tempest, peace might reign!"\n\n"Yes, he is more than a man; he sees everything!" thought I; "how can I\nhelp loving him!"\n\nI left the piano, took hold of his hand, and began to walk up and down\nwith him, measuring my steps by his.\n\n"Well!" he said, looking down at me with a smile.\n\n"Well!" I echoed; and our two hearts seemed to spring to each other once\nmore.\n\nAt the end of a fortnight, before the fetes, we were in St. Petersburg.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\nOur removal to St. Petersburg, a week in Moscow, visits to his relatives\nand to my own, settling ourselves in our new apartment, the journey, the\nnew city, the new faces, all seemed to me like a dream. All was so\nnovel, so changeful, so gay, all was so brightened for me by his\npresence, by his love, that the placid country life appeared to me\nsomething very far off, a sort of unreal thing. To my great surprise,\ninstead of the arrogant pride, the coldness, I had expected to\nencounter, I was welcomed by all (not only by our relatives, but by\nstrangers,) with such cordiality that it seemed as if they had no\nthought of anything but me, and as if one and all had been longing for\nmy arrival to complete their own happiness. Contrary to my\nanticipations, in the circles of society, even in those which seemed to\nme most select, I discovered many friends and connections of my husband\nwhom he had never mentioned to me, and it often struck me as strange and\ndisagreeable to hear him utter severe strictures upon some of these\npersons who seemed to me so good. I could not understand why he treated\nthem so coldly, or why he tried to avoid some acquaintances whose\nintimacy I thought rather flattering. I thought that the more one knew\nof nice people, the better it was, and all these were nice people.\n\n"Let us see how we shall arrange things," he had said to me before we\nleft the country: "here, we are little Croesuses, and there we shall be\nfar from rich; so we cannot remain in the city longer than Easter, and\nwe cannot go much into society, or we shall find ourselves embarrassed;\nand I would not like you...."\n\n"Why go into society?" I had answered; "we will only visit our\nrelatives, go to the theatre and opera, and to hear any good music, and\neven before Easter we can be at home again in the country."\n\nBut scarcely were we in St. Petersburg than all these fine plans were\nforgotten. I had been suddenly thrown into a world so new, so happy, so\nmany delights had surrounded me, so many objects of heretofore unknown\ninterest were offered to me, that all in a moment, as it were, and\nwithout being conscious of it, I disavowed all my past, I upset all the\nplans formerly arranged. Until now there had been nothing but play; as\nto life itself, it had not yet begun; but here it was now, the real, the\ntrue,--and what will it be in the future? thought I. The anxieties, the\nfits of depression, which came upon me in the country, disappeared\nsuddenly as if by enchantment. My love for my husband became calmer,\nand, on the other hand, it never occurred to me, in this new life, to\nthink that he was loving me less than formerly. Indeed, it was not\npossible for me to doubt this love; each thought was instantly\nunderstood by him, each sentiment shared, each wish gratified. His\nunalterable serenity had vanished, here, or perhaps it had only ceased\nto cause me any irritation. I even felt that besides his old love for me\nhe seemed now to find some new charm in me. Often, after a visit, after\nI had made some new acquaintance, or after an evening at home, when,\nwith secret misgiving lest I should commit some blunder, I had been\nperforming the duties of hostess, he would say to me:\n\n"Well, my little girl! bravo! well done, indeed!"\n\nThis would fill me with delight.\n\nA short time after our arrival he wrote to his mother, and, as he handed\nme the letter to let me add a few words, he said I must not read what he\nhad written; I laughingly persisted in seeing it, and read:\n\n"You would not recognize Katia, I hardly recognize her myself. Where\ncould she have acquired this lovely and graceful ease of manner, this\naffability, this fascination, this sweet, unconscious tact? And still\nalways so simple, so gentle, so full of kindness. Every one is delighted\nwith her; and as for me, I am never tired of admiring her, and, if that\nwere possible, would be more in love with her than ever."\n\n"This, then, is what I am?" I thought. And it gave me so much pleasure\nand gratification that I felt as if I loved him more than ever. My\nsuccess with all our acquaintances was a thing absolutely unexpected by\nme. On all sides I was told: here, that I had particularly pleased my\nuncle, there, that an aunt was raving over me; by this one, that there\nwas not a woman in all St. Petersburg like me; by that one, that if I\nchose there would not be a woman in society so sought after as myself.\nThere was one cousin of my husband especially, Princess D., a lady of\nhigh rank and fashion, no longer young, who announced that she had\nfallen in love with me at first sight, and who did more than any one\nelse to turn my head with flattering attentions. When, for the first\ntime, this cousin proposed to me to go to a ball, and broached the\nsubject to my husband, he turned towards me with an almost imperceptible\nsmile, and mischievous glance, and asked if I wanted to go. I nodded,\nand felt my face flush.\n\n"One would say, a little culprit, confessing a wish," he said, laughing\ngood-humoredly.\n\n"You told me we must not go into company, and that you would not like\nit," I responded, smiling also, and giving him an entreating glance.\n\n"If you wish it very much, we will go."\n\n"Indeed, I would rather...."\n\n"Do you wish it, wish it very much?" he repeated.\n\nI made no answer.\n\n"The greatest harm is not in the world, society, itself," he went on;\n"it is unsatisfied worldly aspirations that are so evil, so unhealthful.\nCertainly we must go,--and we will go," he concluded, unhesitatingly.\n\n"To tell you the truth," I replied, "there is nothing in the world I\nlong for so much as to go to this ball!"\n\nWe went to it, and my delight was far beyond all my anticipations. At\nthis ball, even more than before, it seemed to me that I was the centre\naround which everything was revolving; that it was for me alone that\nthis splendid room was in a blaze of light, that the music was sounding,\nthat the gay throng was gathering in ecstasy before me. All, from the\nhair-dresser and my maid to the dancers, and even the stately old\ngentlemen who slowly walked about through the rooms, watching the\nyounger people, seemed to me to be either implying or telling me in\ndownright speech that they were wild about me. The impression which I\nproduced at this ball, and which my cousin proudly confided to me, was\nsummed up in the general verdict that I was not the least in the world\nlike other women, and that there was about me some peculiar quality\nwhich recalled the simplicity and charm of the country. This success\nflattered me so much that I frankly owned to my husband how I longed to\ngo to at least two or three of the balls to be given in the course of\nthe winter, "in order," I said, despite a sharp little whisper from my\nconscience, "that I may be satiated, once for all!"\n\nMy husband willingly consented to this, and at first accompanied me,\nwith evident pride and pleasure in my success, apparently forgetting or\ndisavowing what he had formerly decided on principle.\n\nBut after awhile I could see that he was bored, and growing tired of the\nlife we were leading. However, this was not yet clear enough to my eyes\nfor me to understand the full significance of the grave, watchful look\nhe sometimes directed towards me, even if I noticed the look at all. I\nwas so intoxicated by this love which I seemed so suddenly to have\naroused in all these strangers, by this perfume of elegance, pleasure,\nand novelty, which I here breathed for the first time; by the apparent\nremoval of what had hitherto, as it were, held me down, namely, the\nmoral weight of my husband; it was so sweet to me, not only to walk\nthrough this new world on a level with him, but to find the place given\nme there even higher than his, and yet to love him with all the more\nstrength and independence than before; that I could not understand that\nhe looked on with displeasure at my utter delight in this worldly\nexistence.\n\nI felt a new thrill of pride and deep satisfaction, when upon entering a\nball-room, all eyes would turn towards me; and when he, as if disdaining\nto parade before the multitude his rights of proprietorship, would\nquietly and at once leave my side and go off to be lost in the mass of\nblack coats.\n\n"Only wait!" I often thought, as my eyes sought him out at the end of\nthe room, and rested on his face, dimly seen from the distance between\nus, but sometimes with a very weary look upon it; "wait! when we are at\nhome again you shall see and know for whom I have been glad to be so\nbeautiful and so brilliant, you shall know whom I love far, far above\nall around me this evening." It seemed to me, very sincerely, that my\ndelight in my successes was only for his sake, and also because they\nenabled me to sacrifice even themselves for him. "One thing alone," I\nthought, "might be a danger to me in this life in the world: that is,\nthat one of the men I meet here might conceive a passion for me, and my\nhusband might grow jealous of him; but he had such confidence in me, he\nappeared to be so calm and indifferent, and all these young men seemed\nin my eyes so empty in comparison with him, that this peril, the only\none, as I thought, with which social life could threaten me, had no\nterrors at all. Still, the attentions I received from so many persons in\nsociety gave me such pleasure, such a sense of satisfied self-love that\nI rather felt as if there was some merit in my very love for my husband,\nwhile at the same time it seemed to impress upon my relation to him\ngreater ease and freedom.\n\n"I noticed how very animated your manner was, while you were talking to\nN. N.," I said to him, one evening, upon our return from a ball; and I\nshook my finger at him as I named a well-known lady of St. Petersburg\nwith whom he had spent part of the evening. I only meant to tease him a\nlittle, for he was silent, and had a wearied look.\n\n"Ah, why say such a thing? And for you to say it, Katia!" he exclaimed,\nfrowning, and pressing his lips together as if in physical pain. "That\nis not like you,--not becoming your position, or mine. Leave such\nspeeches to others; bad jests of that kind might entirely do away with\nour good understanding,--and I still hope that this good understanding\nmay return."\n\nI felt confused, and was silent.\n\n"Will it return, Katia? What do you think?" he asked.\n\n"It is not changed,--it will never change," I said, and then I firmly\nbelieved my assertion.\n\n"May God grant it!" he exclaimed, "but it is time we were going back to\nthe country."\n\nThis was the only occasion upon which he spoke to me in this way, and\nthe rest of the time it seemed to me that everything was going on as\ndelightfully for him as for me,--and as for me, oh! I was so\nlight-hearted, so joyous! If occasionally I happened to notice that he\nwas wearied, I would console myself by reflecting how long, for his\nsake, I had been wearied in the country; if our relations seemed to be\nundergoing some little alteration, I thought how speedily they would\nresume their old charm when we should find ourselves again alone, in the\nsummer, at our own Nikolski.\n\nThus the winter sped away without my realizing it; and Easter came, and,\ndespite all our resolutions we were still in St. Petersburg.\n\nThe Sunday following, however, we were really ready to go, everything\nwas packed, my husband had made his final purchases of flowers, gifts,\nthings of all kinds which were needed for the country, and was in one of\nhis happiest, most affectionate moods. Shortly before we were to start,\nwe had an unexpected visit from our cousin, who came to beg us to\npostpone our departure one week, so that we might attend a reception\ngiven by Countess R. on Saturday. She reminded me that I had already\nreceived several invitations from Countess R., which had been declined,\nand told me that Prince M., then in St. Petersburg, had, at the last\nball, expressed a desire to make my acquaintance, that it was with this\nobject in view that he purposed attending this reception, and that he\nwas saying everywhere that I was the loveliest woman in Russia. The\nwhole city would be there,--in one word, I must go! It would be nothing\nwithout me.\n\nMy husband was at the other end of the room, talking to some one.\n\n"So you will certainly come, Katia?" said my cousin.\n\n"We meant to leave for the country, day after to-morrow," I replied,\ndoubtfully, as I glanced at my husband. Our eyes met, and he turned away\nabruptly.\n\n"I will persuade him to stay," said my cousin, "and on Saturday we will\nturn all heads,--won\'t we?"\n\n"Our plans would be disarranged, all our packing is done," I objected\nfeebly, beginning to waver.\n\n"Perhaps she had better go to-day, at once, to pay her respects to the\nprince!" observed my husband from his end of the room, with some\nirritation, and in a dictatorial tone I had never heard from him before.\n\n"Why, he is getting jealous; I see it for the first time!" exclaimed our\ncousin, ironically. "It is not for the prince alone, Sergius\nMikailovitch, but for all of us, that I want her. That is why Countess\nR. is so urgent."\n\n"It depends upon herself," returned my husband, coldly, as he left the\nroom.\n\nI had seen that he was much more agitated than usual; this troubled me,\nand I would not give a decided answer to my cousin. As soon as she was\ngone, I went to look for my husband. He was thoughtfully walking up and\ndown his chamber, and neither saw nor heard me, as I stole softly in on\ntiptoe.\n\n"He is picturing to himself his dear Nikolski," thought I, watching him,\n"he is thinking about his morning coffee in that light drawing-room, his\nfields, his peasants, his evenings at home, and his secret little night\nsuppers! Yes," I decided, in my own mind, "I would give all the balls in\nthe world, and the flatteries of every prince in the universe, to have\nagain his bright joyousness and his loving caresses!"\n\nI was about telling him that I was not going to the reception, that I no\nlonger cared to go, when he suddenly glanced behind him. At the sight of\nme, his brow darkened, and the dreamy gentleness of his countenance\nchanged entirely. The well-known look came to his face, the look of\npenetrating wisdom and patronizing calmness. He would not let me see in\nhim simple human nature: he must remain for me the demi-god upon his\npedestal!\n\n"What is it, my love?" he enquired, turning towards me with quiet\ncarelessness.\n\nI did not answer. I resented his hiding himself from me, his not\nallowing me to see him as I best loved him.\n\n"So you wish to go to this reception, on Saturday?" he continued.\n\n"I did wish to go," I replied, "but it did not suit you. And then, too,\nthe packing is done," I added.\n\nNever had he looked at me so coldly, never spoken so coldly.\n\n"I shall not leave before Tuesday, and I will order the packing to be\nundone," he said; "we will not go until you choose. Do me the favor to\ngo to this entertainment. I shall not leave the city."\n\nAs was his habit when excited, he went on walking about the room with\nquick, irregular steps, and did not look at me.\n\n"Most decidedly, I do not understand you," I said, putting myself in his\nway, and following him with my eyes. "Why do you speak to me in such a\nsingular manner? I am quite ready to sacrifice this pleasure to you, and\nyou, with sarcasm you have never before shown, you require that I shall\ngo!"\n\n"Come! come! You _sacrifice_ yourself" (he laid strong emphasis on the\nword), "and I, I _sacrifice_ myself also! Combat of generosity! There, I\nhope, is what may be called \'family happiness\'!"\n\nThis was the first time I had ever heard from his lips words so hard and\nsatirical. His satire did not touch, and his hardness did not frighten\nme, but they became contagious. Was it really he, always so opposed to\nany debating between us, always so simple and straightforward, who was\nspeaking to me thus? And why? Just because I had offered to sacrifice\nmyself to his pleasure, which was really the supreme thing in my eyes;\njust because, at this moment, with the thought, came the comprehension\nof how much I loved him. Our characters were reversed; it was he who had\nlost all frankness and simplicity, and I who had found them.\n\n"You are so changed," said I, sighing. "Of what am I guilty in your\neyes? It is not this reception, but some old sin, which you are casting\nup against me in your heart. Why not use more sincerity? You were not\nafraid of it with me, once. Speak out,--what have you against me?"\n\n"No matter what he may say," I thought, quickly running over the events\nof the season in my mind, "there is not one thing that he has a right to\nreproach me with, this whole winter."\n\nI went and stood in the middle of the room, so that he would be obliged\nto pass near me, and I looked at him. I said to myself: "He will come\nclose to me, he will put his arms around me and kiss me, and that will\nbe the end of it all;" this thought darted into my head, and it even\ncost me something to let it end so, without my proving to him that he\nwas in the wrong. But he stood still at the end of the room, and,\nlooking in my face:\n\n"You still do not understand me?" he said.\n\n"No."\n\n"Yet ... how can I tell you?... I am appalled, for the first time, I am\nappalled at what I see--what I cannot but see." He stopped, evidently\nfrightened at the rough tone of his voice.\n\n"What do you mean?" I demanded, indignant tears filling my eyes.\n\n"I am appalled that, knowing the prince\'s comments on your beauty, you\nshould, after that, be so ready and willing to run after him, forgetting\nyour husband, yourself, your own dignity as a woman,--and then for you\nnot to understand what your husband has to feel in your stead, since you\nyourself have not this sense of your own dignity!--far from it, you come\nand declare to your husband that you will _sacrifice_ yourself, which is\nequivalent to saying, \'To please His Highness would be my greatest\nhappiness, but I will _sacrifice_ it.\'"\n\nThe more he said, the more the sound of his own voice excited him, and\nthe harder, more cutting and violent, became his voice. I had never\nseen, and had never expected to see him thus; the blood surged to my\nheart; I was frightened, but yet, at the same time, a sense of unmerited\ndisgrace and offended self-love aroused me, and I keenly longed to take\nsome vengeance on him.\n\n"I have long expected this outbreak," said I, "speak, speak!"\n\n"I do not know what you may have expected," he went on, "but I might\nhave anticipated still worse things, from seeing you day by day steeped\nin this slime, this idleness, this luxury, this senseless society; and I\ndid anticipate.... I did anticipate this that to-day covers me with\nshame, and sinks me in misery such as I have never experienced; shame\nfor myself, when your dear friend, prying and fumbling about in my heart\nwith her unclean fingers, spoke of my jealousy,--and jealousy of whom?\nOf a man whom neither you nor I have ever seen! And you, as if\npurposely, you will not understand me, you \'will sacrifice\' to\nme,--whom? Great God!... Shame on your degradation! Sacrifice!" he\nrepeated once more.\n\n"Ah, this then is what is meant by the husband\'s authority," I thought.\n"To insult and humiliate his wife, who is not guilty of the very least\nthing in the world! Here then are \'marital rights;\'--but I, for one,\nwill never submit to them!"\n\n"Well, I sacrifice _nothing_ to you, then," I returned, feeling my\nnostrils dilate, and my face grow bloodless. "I will go to the reception\non Saturday. I most certainly will go!"\n\n"And God give you pleasure in it! Only--all is ended between us!" he\nexclaimed, in an uncontrollable transport of rage. "At least you shall\nnot make a martyr of me any longer. I was a fool who...."\n\nBut his lips trembled, and he made a visible effort not to finish what\nhe had begun to say.\n\nAt this moment I was afraid of him and I hated him. I longed to say a\ngreat many more things to him, and to avenge myself for all his insults;\nbut if I had so much as opened my lips, my tears could no longer have\nbeen restrained, and I would have felt my dignity compromised before\nhim. I left the room, without a word. But scarcely was I beyond the\nsound of his footsteps when I was suddenly seized with terror at the\nthought of what we had done. It seemed to me horrible that, perhaps for\nlife, this bond, which constituted all my happiness, was destroyed, and\nmy impulse was to return at once. But would his passion have subsided\nsufficiently for him to comprehend me, if, without a word, I should hold\nout my hand to him, and look into his eyes? Would he comprehend my\ngenerosity? Suppose he should regard my sincere sorrow as dissimulation?\nOr should consider my voluntary right-doing as repentance, and receive\nme on that score? Or grant me pardon, with proud tranquillity? And why,\nwhen I have loved him so much, oh, _why_ should he have insulted me so?\n\nI did not go back to him, but into my own room, where I sat for a long\ntime, crying, recalling with terror every word of our conversation,\nmentally substituting other words for those we had used, adding\ndifferent and better ones, then reminding myself again, with a mingled\nsense of fright and outraged feeling, of all that had taken place. When\nI came down to tea, in the evening, and in the presence of C., who was\nmaking us a visit, met my husband again, I was aware that from this day\nforward there must be an open gulf between us. C. asked me when we were\ngoing to leave the city. I could not answer her.\n\n"On Tuesday," replied my husband, "we are staying for Countess R\'s\nreception. You are going, no doubt?" he continued, turning to me.\n\nI was frightened at the sound of his voice, although it seemed quite as\nusual, and glanced at my husband. His eyes were fixed on me, with a hard\nironical look, his tone was measured, cold.\n\n"Yes," I replied.\n\nLater, when we were alone, he approached me, and holding out his hand:\n\n"Forget, I entreat you, what I said to you."\n\nI took his hand, a faint smile came to my trembling lips, and the tears\nstarted to my eyes; but he quickly drew it away and, as if fearing a\nsentimental scene, went and sat down in an arm-chair at some distance\nfrom me. "Is it possible that he still believes himself right?" thought\nI; and I had on my lips a cordial explanation, and a request not to go\nto the reception.\n\n"I must write to mamma that we have postponed our departure," said he,\n"or she will be uneasy."\n\n"And when do you intend to leave?" I asked.\n\n"On the Tuesday after the reception."\n\n"I hope this is not on my account," said I, looking into his eyes, but\nthey only looked back into mine without telling me anything, as if they\nwere held far from me by some secret force. All at once, his face\nappeared to me old and disagreeable.\n\nWe went to the reception, and seemingly our relations were again cordial\nand affectionate, but in reality they were quite unlike what they had\nbeen in the past.\n\nAt the reception I was sitting in the midst of a circle of ladies, when\nthe prince approached me, so that I was obliged to stand up and speak\nto him. As I did so, my eyes involuntarily sought my husband; I saw him\nlook at me, from the other end of the room, and then turn away. Such a\nrush of shame and sorrow came over me, that I felt almost ill, and I\nknew that my face and neck grew scarlet under the eyes of the prince.\nBut I had to stand and listen to what he was saying to me, all the while\nfeeling him scrutinize me keenly from head to foot. Our conversation was\nnot long, there was not room near me for him to sit down, and he could\nnot help seeing how ill at ease I was with him. We talked of the last\nball, where I was to spend the summer, _etc._ Upon leaving me he\nexpressed a wish to make my husband\'s acquaintance, and in a little\nwhile I saw them meet, at the other end of the room, and begin to talk\nwith each other. The prince must have made some remark concerning me,\nfor I saw him smile and glance in my direction.\n\nMy husband\'s face flushed darkly, he bowed, and was the first to\nconclude the interview. I felt my color rise, also, for I was mortified\nto think what opinion the prince must have formed of me, and more\nespecially of Sergius. It seemed to me that every one must have observed\nmy embarrassment while I was talking with the prince, and also his very\nsingular manner; "God knows," said I to myself, "what interpretation may\nbe put upon it; could any one happen to know of my wrangle with my\nhusband?" My cousin took me home, and on the way we were talking about\nhim. I could not resist telling her all that had passed between us in\nregard to this unfortunate reception. She soothed me by assurances that\nit was only one of those frequent quarrels, which signify nothing at all\nand leave no result behind them; and in explaining my husband\'s\ncharacter from her point of view, she spoke of him as extremely reserved\nand proud. I agreed with her, and it seemed to me that, after this, I\ncomprehended his character more clearly and much more calmly.\n\nBut afterwards, when we were again alone together, this judgment of mine\nwith regard to him appeared to me a real crime, which weighed upon my\nconscience, and I felt that the gulf between us was widening more and\nmore.\n\nFrom this day on, our life and our mutual relations suffered a complete\nchange. Being alone together was no longer a delight to us. There were\nsubjects to be avoided, and it was easier for us to talk to each other\nin the presence of a third person. If in the course of conversation any\nallusion chanced to be made, either to life in the country, or to balls,\ndazzling wild-fire seemed to dance before our eyes and make us afraid to\nlook at each other; I knew that his embarrassment was as great as my\nown; we both realized how far asunder we were thrust by that dividing\ngulf, and dreaded drawing nearer. I was persuaded that he was passionate\nand proud, and that I must be very careful not to run against his weak\npoints. And, on his part, he was convinced that I could not exist\noutside of the life of the world, that a home in the country did not\nsuit me at all, and that he must resign himself to this unhappy\npredilection. Therefore we both shunned any direct conversation upon\nsuch subjects, and each erroneously judged the other. We had long\nceased to be respectively, in each other\'s eyes, the most perfect beings\nin this world; on the contrary, we were beginning to compare each other\nwith those around us, and to measure with secret appreciation our own\ncharacters.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\nI had been very unwell before we left St. Petersburg, and instead of\ngoing home we moved into a villa at a short distance from the city,\nwhere my husband left me while he went to see his mother. I was then\nquite well enough to accompany him, but he urged me not to do so,\nalleging as his reason my state of health. I quite understood that he\nwas not really afraid of my health, but he was possessed by the idea\nthat it would not be good for us to be in the country; I did not insist\nvery strenuously, and remained where I was. Without him I felt myself\ntruly in the midst of emptiness and isolation; but when he returned I\nperceived that his presence no longer added to my life what it had been\nwont to add. Those former relations, when any thought, any sensation,\nnot communicated to him, oppressed me like a crime; when all his\nactions, all his words, appeared to me models of perfection; when, from\nsheer joy, we would laugh at nothing, looking at each other; those\nrelations had so insensibly changed into something quite different, that\nwe ourselves hardly admitted the transformation. But the fact was that\neach of us had now separate occupations and interests, which we no\nlonger sought to share. We had even ceased to be at all troubled at thus\nliving in entirely distinct worlds, and entirely as strangers to each\nother. We had become habituated to this thought, and at the end of a\nyear there was no longer the mutual embarrassment when our eyes chanced\nto meet. His boyishness, his outbursts of light-hearted gaiety when with\nme, were gone; gone, too, was that indulgent indifference, against which\nI had so often risen in rebellion; nor had the penetrating look\nsurvived, which, in other days, had at once disturbed and delighted me;\nthere were no more of the prayers, no more of the hours of exaltation\nwhich we had so loved to share, and indeed we saw each other only very\nrarely; he was constantly out, and I no longer dreaded remaining alone,\nno longer complained of it; I was perpetually engrossed, on my side,\nwith the obligations of society, and never felt any need of him\nwhatever.\n\nScenes and altercations between us were quite unheard-of. I endeavored\nto satisfy him, he carried out all my wishes, any one would have said\nthat we still loved each other.\n\nWhen we were alone together, which was of rare occurrence, I felt\nneither joy, agitation, nor embarrassment, in his presence, any more\nthan if I had been alone. I knew well that here was no new-comer, no\nstranger, but on the contrary, a very excellent man, in short my\nhusband, whom I knew just as well as I knew myself. I was persuaded that\nI could tell beforehand all that he would do, all that he would think,\nprecisely what view he would take of any matter, and if he did or\nthought otherwise I only considered that he made a mistake; I never\nexpected anything at all from him. In one word, it was my husband, that\nwas all. It seemed to me that things were so, and had to be so; that no\nother relations between us could exist, or indeed ever had existed. When\nhe went away, especially at first, I still felt terribly lonely, and\nwhile he was absent I felt the full value of his support; when he came\nhome, I would even throw myself in his arms with joy; but scarcely had\ntwo hours elapsed ere I had forgotten this joy, and would find that I\nhad nothing to say to him. In these brief moments, when calm, temperate\ntenderness seemed to revive between us, it seemed to me that there never\nhad been anything but this; that this alone was what had once so\npowerfully stirred my heart, and I thought I read in his eyes the same\nimpression. I felt that to this tenderness there was a limit, which he\ndid not wish to pass, and neither did I. Sometimes this caused me a\nlittle regret, but I had no time to think about it seriously, and I\ntried to put it out of my mind, by giving myself up to a variety of\namusements of which I did not even render a clear account to myself, but\nwhich perpetually offered themselves to me. The life in the world,\nwhich, at first, had bewildered me with its splendor and the\ngratification it afforded to my self-love, had soon established entire\ndominion over my inclinations, and become at once a habit and a bondage,\noccupying in my soul that place which I had fancied would be the home of\nsentiment. Therefore I avoided being alone, dreading lest it might force\nme to look into and realize my condition. My whole time, from the\nearliest hour in the morning till the latest at night, was appropriated\nto something; even if I did not go out, there was no time that I left\nfree. I found in this life neither pleasure, nor weariness, and it\nseemed to me it had always been thus.\n\nIn this manner three years passed away, and our relations with each\nother remained the same, benumbed, congealed, motionless, as if no\nalteration could come to them, either for better or worse. During the\ncourse of these three years there were two important events in the\nfamily, but neither brought any change to my own life. These events were\nthe birth of my first child, and the death of Tatiana Semenovna. At\nfirst the maternal sentiment took possession of me with such power, so\ngreat and unexpected a rapture seized upon me, that I imagined a new\nexistence was beginning; but at the end of two months, when I commenced\nto go into society once more, this sentiment, which had been gradually\nsubsiding, had become nothing more than the habitual and cold\nperformance of a duty. My husband, on the contrary, from the day of this\nson\'s birth, had become his old self, gentle, calm, and home-loving,\nrecalling for his child, all his former tenderness and gaiety. Often\nwhen I went in my ball-dress into the child\'s nursery, to give him the\nevening benediction before starting and found my husband there, I would\ncatch a glance of reproach, or a severe and watchful look fixed upon me,\nand I would all at once feel ashamed. I was myself terrified at my\nindifference towards my own child, and I asked myself: "Can I be so much\nworse than other women?--But what is to be done?" I questioned. "Of\ncourse I love my son, but, for all that, I cannot sit down beside him\nfor whole days at a time, that would bore me to death; and as for making\na pretence, nothing in the world would induce me to do such a thing!"\n\nThe death of my husband\'s mother was a great grief to him; it was very\npainful to him, he said, to live after her at Nikolski, but though I\nalso regretted her and really sympathized with his sorrow, it would have\nbeen at that time more agreeable, more restful to me, to return and make\nour residence there. We had passed the greater part of these three years\nin the city; once only had I been at Nikolski, for a visit of two\nmonths; and during the third year we had been abroad.\n\nWe passed this summer at the baths.\n\nI was then twenty-one years of age. We were, I thought, prosperous; from\nmy home life I expected no more than it had already given me; all the\npeople whom I knew, it seemed to me, loved me; my health was excellent,\nI knew that I was pretty, my _toilettes_ were the freshest at the baths,\nthe weather was superb, an indefinable atmosphere of beauty and elegance\nsurrounded me, and everything appeared to me in the highest degree\ndelightful and joyous. Yet I was not, as light-hearted as I had been in\nthe old days at Nikolski, when I had felt that my happiness was within\nmyself, when I was happy because I deserved to be so, when my happiness\nwas great but might be greater still. Now all was different;\nnevertheless the summer was charming. I had nothing to desire, nothing\nto hope, nothing to fear; my life, as it seemed to me, was at its full,\nand my conscience, it also seemed to me, was entirely clear.\n\nAmong the men most conspicuous at the baths during this season, there\nwas not one whom, for any reason whatever, I preferred above the others,\nnot even old Prince K. our ambassador, who paid me distinguished\nattention. One was too young, another was too old, this one was an\nEnglishman with light curly hair, that one, a bearded Frenchman; I was\nperfectly indifferent to all, but, at the same time, all were\nindispensable to me. Insignificant as they might be, they yet belonged\nto, and formed a part of, this life of elegance surrounding me, this\natmosphere in which I breathed. However, there was one among them, an\nItalian, Marquis D. who, by the bold fashion in which he showed the\nadmiration he felt for me, had attracted my attention more than the\nothers. He allowed no occasion to escape him of meeting me, dancing with\nme, appearing on horseback beside me, accompanying me to the casino, and\nhe was constantly telling me how beautiful I was. From my window I\nsometimes saw him wandering around our house, and more than once the\nannoying persistence of the glances shot towards me from his flashing\neyes had made me blush and turn away.\n\nHe was young, handsome, elegant; and one remarkable thing about him was\nhis extraordinary resemblance to my husband, especially in his smile and\nsomething about the upper part of the face, though he was the handsomer\nman of the two. I was struck by the likeness, in spite of decided\ndifferences in some particulars, in the mouth for instance, the look,\nthe longer shape of the chin; and instead of the charm given to my\nhusband\'s face by his expression of kindness and ideal calmness, there\nwas in the other something gross and almost bestial. After a while I\ncould not help seeing that he was passionately in love with me; I\nsometimes found myself thinking of him with lofty pity. I undertook to\ntranquillize him, and bring him down to terms of cordial confidence and\nfriendship, but he repelled these attempts with trenchant disdain, and,\nto my great discomfiture, continued to show indications of a passion,\nsilent, indeed, as yet, but momentarily threatening to break forth.\nAlthough I would not acknowledge it to myself, I was afraid of this man,\nand seemed, against my own will, as it were, forced to think of him. My\nhusband had made his acquaintance, and was even more intimate with him\nthan with most of our circle, with whom he confined himself to being\nsimply the husband of his wife, and to whom his bearing was haughty and\ncold.\n\nTowards the end of the season I had a slight illness, which confined me\nto the house for two weeks. The first time I went out, after my\nrecovery, was to listen to the music in the evening, and I was at once\ntold of the arrival of Lady C. a noted beauty, who had been expected\nfor some time. A circle of friends quickly gathered around me, eagerly\nwelcoming me once more among them, but a yet larger circle was forming\nabout the new belle, and everybody near me was telling me about her and\nher beauty. She was pointed out to me; a beautiful and bewitching woman,\ntruly, but with an expression of confidence and self-sufficiency which\nimpressed me unpleasantly, and I said so. That evening, everything that\nusually seemed so bright and delightful was tiresome to me. The\nfollowing day Lady C. organized an expedition to the castle, which I\ndeclined. Hardly any one remained behind with me, and the aspect of\naffairs was decidedly changed to my eyes. All, men and things, seemed\nstupid and dull; I felt like crying, and resolved to complete my cure as\nsoon as possible and go home to Russia. At the bottom of my heart lurked\nbad, malevolent feelings, but I would not confess it to myself. I said\nthat I was not well, making that a pretext for giving up society. I very\nseldom went out, and then only in the morning, alone, to drink the\nwaters, or for a quiet walk or drive about the environs with L. M., one\nof my Russian acquaintances. My husband was absent at this time, having\ngone, some days before, to Heidelberg, to wait there until the end of my\nprescribed stay should allow our return to Russia, and he came to see me\nonly now and then.\n\nOne day Lady C. had carried off most of the company on some party of\npleasure, and after dinner L. M. and I made a little excursion to the\ncastle by ourselves. While our carriage was slowly following the winding\nroad between the double rows of chestnuts, centuries old, between whose\ngray trunks we saw in the distance the exquisite environs of Baden,\nlying in the purple light of the setting sun, we unconsciously fell into\na serious strain of conversation, which had never before been the case\nwith us. L. M., whom I had known so long, now for the first time\nappeared to me as a lovely intelligent woman, with whom one could\ndiscuss any topic whatever, and whose society was full of charm and\ninterest. We talked about family duties and pleasures, children, the\nvacuous life led in such places as we were now in, our desire to return\nto Russia, to the country, and we both fell into a grave, gentle mood,\nwhich was still upon us when we reached the castle. Within its broken\nwalls all was in deep shadow, cool and still, the summits of the towers\nwere yet in the sunlight, and the least sound of voice or footstep\nre-echoed among the arches. Through the doorway we saw the beautiful\nstretch of country surrounding Baden,--beautiful, yet to our Russian\neyes, cold and stern.\n\nWe sat down to rest, silently watching the sinking sun. Presently we\nheard voices, they grew more distinct, and I thought I caught my own\nname. I listened involuntarily, and heard a few words. I recognized the\nvoices; they were those of the Marquis D. and of a Frenchman, his\nfriend, whom I also knew. They were talking about me and Lady C. The\nFrenchman was comparing one with the other, and analyzing our beauty. He\nsaid nothing objectionable, yet I felt the blood rush to my heart as he\nspoke. He entered into detail as to what he found attractive in both\nLady C. and myself. As for me, I was already a mother, while Lady C. was\nbut nineteen years of age; my hair was more beautiful, but Lady C.\'s was\nmore gracefully arranged; Lady C. was more the high born dame "while\nyours," he said, alluding to me, "is one of the little princesses so\noften sent us by Russia." He concluded by saying that it was very\ndiscreet in me not to attempt to contest the field with Lady C., for, if\nI did, I most assuredly would find Baden my burial-place.\n\nThis cut me to the quick.\n\n"Unless she chose to console herself with you!" added the Frenchman with\na gay, cruel laugh.\n\n"If she goes, I shall follow," was the coarse reply of the voice with\nthe Italian accent.\n\n"Happy mortal! he can still love!" commented the other, mockingly.\n\n"Love!" the Italian was silent a moment, then went on. "I cannot help\nloving! Without love there is no life. To make of one\'s life a\nromance,--that is the only good. And my romances never break off in the\nmiddle; this one, like the others, I will carry out to the end."\n\n"Good luck, my friend!" said the Frenchman.\n\nI heard no more for the speakers seemed to turn the angle of the wall,\nand their steps receded on the other side. They descended the broken\nstairs, and in a few moments emerged from a side-door near us, showing\nmuch surprise at the sight of us. I felt my cheeks flame when Marquis D.\napproached me, and was confused and frightened at his offering me his\narm upon our leaving the castle. I could not refuse it, and following L.\nM. who led the way with his friend, we went down towards the carriage. I\nwas indignant at what the Frenchman had said of me, though I could not\nhelp secretly admitting that he had done nothing but put into language\nwhat I myself had already felt, but the words of the marquis had\nconfounded and revolted me by their grossness. I was tortured by the\nthought of having heard them, and at the same time I had suddenly lost\nall fear of him. I was disgusted at feeling him so near me; without\nlooking at him, without answering him, trying, though I still had his\narm, to keep so far from him that I could not hear his whispers, I\nwalked on quickly, close behind L. M. and the Frenchman. The marquis was\ntalking about the lovely view, the unexpected delight of meeting me, and\nI know not what besides, but I did not listen to him. The whole time I\nwas thinking about my husband, my son, Russia; divided feelings of shame\nand pity took hold of me, and I was possessed by a desire to hurry home,\nto shut myself up in my solitary room in the _Hotel de Bade_, where I\nmight be free to reflect upon all that seemed so suddenly to have risen\nup within my soul. But L. M. was walking rather slowly, the carriage was\nstill some distance away, and it seemed to me that my escort was\nobstinately slackening our pace, as if he meant to be left alone with\nme. "That shall not be!" I said to myself, quickening my steps. But he\nundisguisedly kept me back, holding my arm with a close pressure; at\nthis moment L. M. turned a corner of the road, and we were left alone.\nI was seized with alarm.\n\n"Excuse me," said I coldly, drawing my arm out of his, but the lace\ncaught on one of his buttons. He stooped towards me to disengage it, and\nhis ungloved fingers rested on my arm. A new sensation--not fright,\ncertainly not pleasure--sent a chill shiver through me. I looked up at\nhim, meaning my glance to express all the cold contempt I felt for him;\nbut instead of this, he seemed to read in it only agitation and alarm.\nHis ardent, humid eyes were fixed passionately upon me, his hands\ngrasped my wrists, his half-open lips were murmuring to me, telling me\nthat he loved me, that I was everything to him, his hold upon me growing\nstronger and closer with every word. I felt fire in my veins, my vision\nwas obscured, I trembled from head to foot, and the words I tried to\nutter died away in my throat. Suddenly I felt a kiss upon my cheek; I\nshivered, and looked into his face again, powerless to speak or stir,\nexpecting and wishing I knew not what.\n\nIt was only an instant. But this instant was terrible! In it I saw him\nas he was, I analyzed his face at a glance: low brow, straight correct\nnose with swelling nostrils, fine beard and mustache waxed and pointed,\ncheeks carefully shaven, brown neck. I hated him, I feared him, he was a\nstranger to me; nevertheless, at this moment, how powerfully the emotion\nand passion of this detestable man, this stranger, was re-echoing within\nme!\n\n"I love you!" was the murmur of the voice so like my husband\'s. My\nhusband and my child,--hurriedly my mind flashed to them, as beings\ndearly loved, once existent, now gone, lost, done with. But suddenly\nfrom around the turn of the road I heard L. M.\'s voice calling me. I\nrecovered myself, snatched away my hands without looking at him, and\nalmost flew to rejoin her. Not until we were in the caleche did I glance\nback at him. He took off his hat, and said something to me--I know not\nwhat--smiling. He little knew what inexpressible torture he made me\nendure at that moment.\n\nLife appeared so miserable, the future so desperate, the past so\nsombre! L. M. talked to me, but I did not understand one word she was\nsaying. It seemed as though she was only talking to me from compassion,\nand to hide the contempt she felt. I thought I read this contempt, this\ninsulting compassion in every word, every glance. That kiss was burning\ninto my cheek with cutting shame, and to think of my husband and child\nwas insupportable to me. Once alone in my chamber, I hoped to be able to\nmeditate upon my situation, but I found it was frightful to remain\nalone. I could not drink the tea that was brought me, and without\nknowing why, hurriedly I decided to take the evening train for\nHeidelberg, to rejoin my husband. When I was seated with my maid in the\nempty compartment, when the train was at last in motion, and I breathed\nthe fresh air rushing in through the empty windows, I began to be myself\nagain, and to think with some degree of clearness over my past and my\nfuture. All my married life, from the day of our departure for St.\nPetersburg, lay before me in a new light, that of awakened and accusing\nconscience.\n\nFor the first time, I vividly recalled the commencement of my life in\nthe country, my plans; for the first time, the thought came to my mind:\nhow happy he was then! And I suddenly felt guilty towards him. "But\nthen, why not check me, why dissimulate before me, why avoid all\nexplanation, why insult me?" I asked myself. "Why not use the power of\nhis love? But perhaps he no longer loved me?"--Yet, whether he was to\nblame or not, here was this on my cheek, this kiss which I still felt.\nThe nearer I came to Heidelberg, and the more clearly my husband\'s image\npresented itself, the more terrible became the imminent meeting with\nhim. "I will tell him all, all; my eyes will be blinded with tears of\nrepentance," thought I, "and he will forgive me." But I did not myself\nknow what was this "all" that I was going to tell him, nor was I\nabsolutely sure that he would forgive me. In fact, when I entered his\nroom and saw his face, so tranquil despite its surprise, I felt no\nlonger able to tell him anything, to confess anything, to entreat his\nforgiveness for anything. An unspeakable sorrow and deep repentance were\nweighing me down.\n\n"What were you thinking of?" he said: "I intended joining you at Baden\nto-morrow." But a second glance at me seemed to startle him. "Is\nanything wrong? What is the matter with you?" he exclaimed.\n\n"Nothing," I replied, keeping back my tears. "I have come away ... I am\nnot going back ... Let us go--to-morrow if we can--home to Russia!"\n\nHe was silent for some time, watching me narrowly.\n\n"Come, tell me what has occurred," he said, at length.\n\nI felt my face grow scarlet, and my eyes sank. His were glittering with\nan indefinable foreboding, and hot anger. I dreaded the thoughts which\nmight be assailing him, and, with a power of dissimulation of which I\ncould not have believed myself capable, I made haste to answer:\n\n"Nothing has occurred,--but I was overwhelmed by weariness and\ndejection; I was alone, I began to think of you, and of our life. How\nlong I have been to blame towards you! After this, you may take me with\nyou wherever you wish! Yes, I have long been to blame," I repeated, and\nmy tears began to fall fast. "Let us go back to the country," I cried,\n"and forever!"\n\n"Ah! my love, spare me these sentimental scenes," said he, coldly; "for\nyou to go to the country will be all very well, just now, for we are\nrunning a little short of money; but as for its being \'forever,\' that is\nbut a notion: I know you could not stay there long! Come, drink a cup of\ntea,--that is the best thing to do," he concluded, rising to call a\nservant.\n\nI could not help imagining what his thoughts of me doubtless were, and I\nfelt indignant at the frightful ideas which I attributed to him as I met\nthe look of shame and vigilant suspicion which he bent upon me. No, he\nwill not, and he cannot comprehend me!... I told him that I was going\nto see the child, and left him. I longed to be alone, and free to weep,\nweep, weep....\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n\nOur house at Nikolski, so long cold and deserted, came to life again;\nbut the thing which did not come to life was our old existence. Mamma\nwas there no longer, and henceforth we were alone, we two alone with\neach other. But not only was solitude no longer to us what it had once\nbeen, but we found it a burden and constraint. The winter passed all the\nmore drearily for me from my being out of health, and it was not until\nsome time after the birth of my second son that I recovered my strength.\n\nMy relations with my husband continued cold and friendly, as at St.\nPetersburg; but here in the country there was not a floor, not a wall,\nnot a piece of furniture, which did not remind me of what he had been\nto me, and what I had lost. There stood between us, as it were, an\noffence not forgiven; one would have said that he wished to punish me\nfor something, and that he was pretending to himself to be unconscious\nof it. How could I ask forgiveness without knowing for what fault? He\nonly punished me by no longer entirely giving himself up to me, by no\nlonger surrendering to me his whole soul; but to no one, and under no\ncircumstances, was his soul surrendered, any more than if he had none.\nIt sometimes came into my head that he was only making a pretence of\nbeing what he now was, in order to torment me, and that his feelings\nwere in reality what they had formerly been, and I tried to provoke him\ninto letting this be seen; but he invariably eluded all frank\nexplanation; one would have said that he suspected me of dissimulation,\nand dreaded all manifestations of tenderness as attempts to ridicule\nhim. His looks and his air seemed to say: "I know all, there is nothing\nto tell me; all that you would confide to me, I already know; I know\nthat you talk in one manner and act in another." At first I was hurt by\nhis apparent fear of being frank with me, but I soon accustomed myself\nto the thought that in him this was not so much lack of frankness, as\nlack of necessity for frankness.\n\nAnd on my side, my tongue was no longer capable of telling him\nimpulsively, as in the old days, that I loved him, of asking him to read\nthe prayers with me, of calling him to listen to my music when I was\ngoing to play; there seemed to be certain rules of formality tacitly\ndecreed between us. We lived our own lives; he, with his various\ninterests and occupations, in which I no longer claimed nor desired a\nshare; I, with my idle hours, about which he no longer seemed to trouble\nhimself. As for the children, they were still too young to be in any way\na bond between us.\n\nSpring came. Macha and Sonia returned to the country for the summer; and\nas Nikolski was undergoing repairs, we went with them to Pokrovski. The\nsame old home, the terrace, the out-of-door tea-table, the piano in the\nhalf-lighted room, my own old chamber with its white curtains, and the\ngirlish dreams which seemed to have been left behind there, forgotten.\nIn this chamber were two beds; over one, which had been my own, I now\nbent nightly to bless my sturdy Kokocha,[H] in the midst of his bedtime\nfrolics; in the other lay little Vasica,[I] his baby-face rosy with\nsleep, under the soft white blankets. After giving the benediction, I\noften lingered a long time in this peaceful chamber, and from every\ncorner of its walls, from every fold of its curtains, came stealing\naround me forgotten visions of my youth; childish songs, gay choruses,\nfloated again to my ears. And what were they now,--these visions? Were\nthey sounding still, anywhere,--these glad and sweet old songs? All that\nI had hardly dared to hope had come true. My vague and confused dreams\nhad become reality, and it was now my life, so hard, so heavy, so\nstripped of joy. And yet here around me were not all things as before?\nWas it not the same garden that I saw beneath my window, the same\nterrace, the same paths and benches? Far off there, across the ravine,\nthe songs of the nightingales still seemed to rise out of the ripples of\nthe little pond, the lilacs bloomed as they used to do, the moon still\nstood in white glory over the corner of the house, yet for me all was so\nchanged, so changed! Macha and I had our old quiet talks, sitting\ntogether as of old in the salon, and we still talked of him. But Macha\'s\nbrow was grave, her face was wan, her eyes no longer shone with\ncontentment and hope, but were full of sad sympathy, and almost\nexpressed compassion. We no longer went into ecstasies over him, as in\nthe past; we judged him, now; we no longer marvelled at our great\nhappiness and wondered how it came to be ours, we no longer had the\nimpulse to tell all the world what we felt; we whispered in each other\'s\near like conspirators; for the hundredth time we asked each other why\nall was so sad, so changed. As for him, he was still the same, except\nthat the line between his brows was deeper, and his temples were more\nsilvery, and his eyes, watchful, deep, continually turned away from me,\nwere darkened by a shadow. I, too, was still the same, but I no longer\nfelt either love or desire to love. No more wish to work, no more\nsatisfaction with myself. And how far off, how impossible, now appeared\nmy old religious fervor, my old love for him, my old fulness of life! I\ncould not, now, even comprehend what in those days was so luminous and\nso true: the happiness of living for others. Why for others? when I no\nlonger wished to live for myself....\n\nI had entirely given up my music during our residence in St. Petersburg,\nbut now my old piano and my old pieces brought back the love for it.\n\nOne day when I was not feeling well, I stayed at home, alone, while\nMacha and Sonia went with my husband to see the improvements at\nNikolski. The tea-table was set, I went down-stairs, and, while waiting\nfor them, seated myself at the piano. I opened the sonata _Quasi una\nfantasia_, and began to play. No living creature was to be seen or\nheard, the windows were open upon the garden; the familiar notes, so\nsad and penetrating, resounded through the room. I concluded the first\npart, and unconsciously, simply from old habit, I looked across to the\ncorner where he used to sit and listen to me. But he was no longer\nthere, a long-unmoved chair occupied his old place; from the side of the\nopen window a projecting branch of lilac stood out against the burning\nwest, the evening air stole quietly in. I leaned my elbows on the piano,\ncovered my face with both hands, and fell into a fit of musing. I\nremained there a long time, mournfully recalling the old days,\nirrevocably gone, and timidly looking at the days to come. But\nhereafter, it seemed to me, there could be nothing, I could hope\nnothing, desire nothing. "Is it possible that I have outlived all that!"\nthought I, raising my head with horror, and in order to forget and to\ncease thinking, I began to play again, and still the same old _andante_.\n"My God!" I said, "pardon me if I am guilty, or give back to my soul\nwhat made its beauty ... or teach me what I ought to do,--how I ought to\nlive!"\n\nThe sound of wheels echoed on the turf and before the door, then I heard\non the terrace steady steps, well-known to me, then all was quiet. But\nit was no longer the old feeling which stirred in me at these familiar\nfootsteps. They came up behind me when I had finished the sonata, and a\nhand was laid upon my shoulder.\n\n"A happy thought, to play the old sonata!" he said.\n\nI made no answer.\n\n"Have not you had tea?"\n\nI shook my head, without turning towards him, for I did not want him to\nsee the traces of agitation on my face.\n\n"They will be here presently; the horses were a little unruly, and they\nare coming home on foot, by the road," he continued.\n\n"We will wait for them," I said, going out on the terrace, in the hope\nthat he would follow, but he inquired for the children, and went up to\nsee them. Once more, his presence, the sound of his voice, so kind, so\nhonest, dissuaded me from believing that all was lost for me. "What\nmore is there to desire?" I thought: "he is good and true, he is an\nexcellent husband, an excellent father, and I do not myself know what is\nmissing,--what I want."\n\nI went out on the balcony, and sat down under the awning of the terrace,\non the same bench where I was sitting upon the day of our decisive\nexplanation long ago. The sun was nearly down, dusk was gathering; a\nshade of spring softened the pure sky, where one tiny spark was already\ngleaming. The light wind had died away, not a leaf or blade of grass\nstirred; the perfume of the lilacs and cherry-trees, so powerful that\none might have thought all the air itself was in bloom, came in puffs\nover garden and terrace, now faint and now full, making one feel an\nimpulse to close the eyes, to shut out all sight and sound, to banish\nevery sensation save that of inhaling this exquisite fragrance. The\ndahlias and rose-bushes, yet leafless, stood in still lines in the\nnewly-dug black mould of their beds, lifting their heads above their\nwhite props. From afar came the intermittent notes of the nightingales,\nor the rush of their restless flight from place to place.\n\nIt was in vain that I strove to calm myself, I seemed to be waiting and\nwishing for something.\n\nSergius came from up-stairs, and sat down beside me.\n\n"I believe it is going to rain," he said, "they will get wet."\n\n"Yes," I replied; and we were both silent.\n\nIn the meantime, the cloud, without any wind, had crept slowly and\nstealthily above our heads; nature was yet more perfectly tranquil,\nsweet, and still: suddenly one drop fell, and, so to speak, rebounded,\nupon the linen of the awning, another rolled, a growing ball of dust,\nalong the path; then, with a sound like deadened hail, came the heavy\ndash of rain, gathering force every moment. At once, as if by concert,\nfrogs and nightingales were silent; but the light plash of the fountain\nwas still heard beneath the beating of the rain, and far off in the\ndistance some little bird, no doubt safe and dry under a sheltering\nbough, chirped in monotonous rhythm his two recurring notes. Sergius\nrose to go into the house.\n\n"Where are you going?" said I, stopping him. "It is so delightful here!"\n\n"I must send an umbrella and some overshoes."\n\n"It is not necessary, this will be over directly."\n\nHe assented, and we remained standing together by the balustrade of the\nbalcony. I put my hand on the wet slippery rail, and leaned forward into\nthe rain, the cool drops falling lightly on my hair and neck. The cloud,\nbrightening and thinning, scattered in shining spray above us, the\nregular beat of the shower was succeeded by the sound of heavy drops\nfalling more and more rarely from the sky or from the trees. The frogs\nresumed their croaking, the nightingales shook their wings and began\nagain to respond to each other from behind the glistening shrubs, now on\none side, now on another. All was serene again before us.\n\n"How good it is to live!" he said, leaning over the balustrade and\npassing his hand over my wet hair.\n\nThis simple caress acted on me like a reproach, and I longed to let my\ntears flow.\n\n"What more can a man need?" continued he. "I am at this moment so\ncontent, that I feel nothing wanting, and I am completely happy!"\n\n("You did not speak so to me when to hear it would have made my\nhappiness," I thought. "However great yours was, then, you used to say\nthat you wished for more of it, still more. And now you are calm and\ncontent, when my soul is full of inexpressible repentance and\nunsatisfied tears!")\n\n"To me, too, life is good," said I, "and it is precisely because it is\nso good to me, that I am sad. I feel so detached, so incomplete; I am\nalways wanting some other thing, and yet everything here is so good, so\ntranquil! Can it be possible that for you no sorrow ever seems mingled\nwith your pleasure in life?--as if, for instance, you were feeling\nregret for something in the past?"\n\nHe drew away the hand resting on my head, and was silent for a moment.\n\n"Yes, that has been the case with me, formerly, particularly in the\nspring," he said, as if searching his memory. "Yes, I also have spent\nwhole nights in longings and fears,--and what beautiful nights they\nwere!... But then all was before me, and now all is behind; now I am\ncontent with what is, and that to me is perfection," he concluded, with\nsuch easy frankness of manner, that, painful as it was to hear, I was\nconvinced that it was the truth.\n\n"Then you desire nothing more?" I questioned.\n\n"Nothing impossible," he replied, divining my thought. "How wet you have\nmade your head," he went on, caressing me like a child, and passing his\nhand again over my hair; "you are jealous of the leaves and grass which\nthe rain was falling on; you would like to be the grass and the leaves\nand the rain; while I--I enjoy simply seeing them, as I do seeing\nwhatever is good, young, happy."\n\n"And you regret nothing in the past?" I persisted, with the dull weight\non my heart growing heavier and heavier.\n\nHe seemed to muse for a moment, keeping silent. I saw that he wished to\nanswer honestly.\n\n"No!" he said, at length, briefly.\n\n"That is not true! that is not true!" I cried, turning and facing him,\nwith my eyes fixed upon his. "You do not regret the past?"\n\n"No!" he repeated. "I bless it, but I do not regret it."\n\n"And you would not wish to go back to it?"\n\nHe turned away, looking out over the garden.\n\n"I no more wish that than I would wish to have wings. It cannot be."\n\n"And you would not re-make this past? And you reproach neither yourself,\nnor me?"\n\n"Never! all has been for the best."\n\n"Listen!" said I, seizing his hand to force him to turn towards me.\n"Listen! Why did you never tell me what you wished from me, that I might\nhave lived exactly as you desired? Why did you give me a liberty which\nI knew not how to use? why did you cease to teach me? If you had wished\nit, if you had cared to guide me differently, nothing, nothing would\nhave happened," I went on, in a voice which more and more energetically\nexpressed anger and reproach, with none of the former love.\n\n"What is it that would not have happened?" said he with surprise,\nturning towards me. "There has been nothing. All is well, very well," he\nrepeated smiling.\n\n"Can it be possible," I thought, that he does not understand me? "or,\nworse still, that he will not understand me?" and my tears began to\nfall.\n\n"This would have happened,--that, not having made me guilty towards you,\nyou would not have punished me by your indifference, your contempt," I\nbroke out. "What would _not_ have happened is seeing myself, with no\nfault on my own part, suddenly robbed by you of all that was dear to\nme."\n\n"What are you saying, my darling?" he exclaimed, as if he had not\nunderstood my words.\n\n"No, let me finish! You have robbed me of your confidence, your love,\neven of your esteem, and this because I ceased to believe that you still\nloved me after what had taken place! No," I went on, checking him again\nas he was about to interrupt me, "for once I must speak out all that has\nbeen torturing me so long! Was I to blame because I did not know life,\nand because you left me to find it out for myself?... And am I to blame\nthat now,--when at last I comprehend, of myself, what is necessary in\nlife; now, when for more than a year I have been making a struggle to\nreturn to you,--you constantly repulse me, constantly pretend not to\nknow what I want? and things are so arranged that there is never\nanything for you to reproach yourself with, while I am left to be\nmiserable and guilty? Yes, you would cast me back again into that life\nwhich must make wretchedness for me and for you!"\n\n"And how am I doing that?" he asked, with sincere surprise and alarm.\n\n"Did not you tell me yesterday,--yes, you tell me so perpetually,--that\nthe life here does not suit me, and that we must go to St. Petersburg\nagain for the winter? Instead of supporting me," I continued, "you avoid\nall frankness with me, any talk that is sweet, and real. And then if I\nfall, you will reproach me with it, or you will make light of it!"\n\n"Stop, stop," he said severely and coldly; "what you are saying is not\nright. It only shows that you are badly disposed towards me, that you do\nnot...."\n\n"That I do not love you! say it! say it, then!" I exclaimed, blind with\nmy tears. I sat down on the bench, and covered my face with my\nhandkerchief.\n\n"That is the way he understands me!" I thought, trying to control my\nchoking sobs. "It is all over with our old love!" said the voice in my\nheart. He did not come near me, and made no attempt to console me. He\nwas wounded by what I had said. His voice was calm and dry, as he began:\n\n"I do not know what you have to reproach me with, except that I do not\nlove you as I used to do!"\n\n"As you used to love me!..." I murmured under my handkerchief, drenching\nit with bitter tears.\n\n"And for that, time and ourselves are equally guilty. For each period\nthere is one suitable phase of love...."\n\nHe was silent.\n\n"And shall I tell you the whole truth, since you desire frankness? Just\nas, during that first year of our acquaintance, I spent night after\nnight without sleep, thinking of you and building up my own love, until\nit grew to fill all my heart, so in St. Petersburg and while we were\nabroad I spent fearful nights in striving to break down and destroy this\nlove which was my torment. I could not destroy it, but I did at least\ndestroy the element which had tormented me; I became tranquil, and yet I\ncontinued to love you,--but it was with another love."\n\n"And you call _that_ love, when it was nothing but a punishment!" I\nreplied. "Why did you let me live in the world, if it appeared to you\nso pernicious that because of it you would cease to love me?"\n\n"It was not the world, my dear, that was the guilty one."\n\n"Why did you not use your power? Why did you not strangle me? Murder me?\nThat would have been better for me to-day than to have lost all that\nmade my happiness,--it would have been better for me, and at least there\nwould not have been the shame!"\n\nI began to sob again, and I covered my face.\n\nJust at that moment Macha and Sonia, wet and merry, ran up on the\nterrace, laughing and talking; but at the sight of us their voices were\nhushed, and they hurried into the house.\n\nWe remained where we were, for a long time, silent; after they were\ngone, I sobbed on until my tears were exhausted and I felt somewhat\ncalmer. I looked at him. He was sitting with his head resting on his\nhand, and appeared to wish to say something to me in response to my\nglance, but he only gave a heavy sigh and put his head down again.\n\nI went to him and drew his hand away. He turned then, and looked at me\nthoughtfully.\n\n"Yes," he said, as if pursuing his own thoughts, "for all of us, and\nparticularly for you women, it is necessary that we should ourselves\nlift to our own lips the cup of the vanities of life, before we can\ntaste life itself; no one believes the experience of others. You had\nnot, at that time, dipped very deep into the science of those entrancing\nand seducing vanities. Therefore I allowed you to plunge for a moment; I\nhad no right to forbid it, simply because my own hour for it was long\nsince over."\n\n"Why did you let me live among these vanities, if you loved me?"\n\n"Because you would not--nay, more, you could not--have believed me about\nthem; it was necessary for you to learn for yourself; and you have\nlearned."\n\n"You reasoned a great deal," said I. "That was because you loved me so\nlittle."\n\nWe were silent again.\n\n"What you have just said to me is hard, but it is the truth," he\nresumed, after a while, rising abruptly, and beginning to walk about the\nterrace; "yes, it is the truth! I have been to blame," he went on,\nstopping before me.... "Either I ought not to have let myself love you\nat all, or I ought to have loved you more simply--yes!"\n\n"Sergius, let us forget everything," said I, timidly.\n\n"No, what is gone never comes again, there can be no turning back ..."\nhis voice softened as he spoke.\n\n"It has already come again," said I, laying my hand on his shoulder.\n\nHe took the hand in his, and pressed it.\n\n"No, I was not telling the truth, when I pretended not to regret the\npast; no, I do regret your past love; I bitterly mourn over it,--this\nlove, which can no longer exist. Who is to blame? I do not know. Love\nthere may even yet be, but not the same; its place is still there, but\ndarkened and desolated; it is without savor and without strength; the\nremembrance has not vanished, nor the gratitude, but...."\n\n"Do not speak so," I interrupted. "Let it come to life again, let it be\nwhat it was.... Might that be?" I asked, looking into his face. His eyes\nwere serene, quiet, and met mine without their old deep look.\n\nEven as I asked the question I felt the answer, felt that my wish was no\nlonger possible to realize. He smiled; it seemed to me an old man\'s\nsmile, gentle and full of peace.\n\n"How young you still are, and how old I am already!" he said. "Why\ndelude ourselves?" he added, still with the same smile.\n\nI remained near him, silent, and feeling my soul grow more and more\ntranquil.\n\n"Do not let us try to repeat life," he went on, "nor to lie to\nourselves. But it is something, to have no longer, God willing, either\ndisquiet or distress. We have nothing to seek for. We have already\nfound, already shared, happiness enough. All we have to do now is to\nopen the way,--you see to whom...." he said, pointing out little Vania,\nin his nurse\'s arms, at the terrace door. "That is necessary, dear\nlove," he concluded, bending over me and dropping a kiss on my hair.\n\nIt was no longer a lover, it was an old friend who gave the caress.\n\nThe perfumed freshness of night was rising, sweeter and stronger, from\nthe garden; the few sounds audible were solemn and far off, and soon\ngave way to deep tranquillity; one by one the stars shone out. I looked\nat him, and all at once I became conscious of infinite relief in my\nsoul; it was as if a moral nerve, whose sensitiveness had caused me keen\nsuffering had suddenly been removed. Quietly and clearly I comprehended\nthat the dominant sentiment of this phase of my existence was\nirrevocably gone, as was the phase itself, and that not only was its\nreturn impossible, but that it would be to me full of unendurable pain.\nThere had been enough of this time; and had it indeed been so\ngood,--this time, which to me had seemed to enclose such joys? And\nalready it had lasted so long, so long!\n\n"But tea is waiting," he said, gently; and we went together to the\ndrawing-room.\n\nAt the door I met Macha, and the nurse with Vania. I took the child in\nmy arms, wrapped up the little bare feet, and, holding it close to my\nheart, barely touched its lips with a light kiss. Almost asleep as it\nwas, it moved its little arms, stretched out the crumpled fingers, and\nopened its bewildered eyes, as if trying to find or remember something;\nall at once its eyes fell on me, a look of intelligence sparkled in\nthem, and the pink pursed-up lips lengthened in a baby smile. "You are\nmine, mine!" thought I, with a delicious thrill running through me, and\nas I strained it to my heart I was half afraid of hurting it with my\neager embrace. Over and over I kissed its cold little feet, its breast,\nits arms, and head with the scant covering of down. My husband came up\nto us, quickly drew the wrapping over the baby\'s face, then, drawing it\naway again:\n\n"Ivan Sergevitch!" he said with finger under the little chin.\n\nBut I, in my turn, covered up Ivan Sergevitch. No one should look at\nhim so long, except myself. I glanced at my husband, his eyes laughed as\nthey rested on mine, and it was long since I had met his with such happy\njoy.\n\nThis day ended my romance with my husband. The old love remained, and\nthe dear remembrance of what could never come back to me; but a new love\nfor my children and my children\'s father, began another life and another\nway of happiness, up to this hour unending ... for at last I know that\nin home, and in the pure joys of home will be found--real happiness!\n\nTHE END.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n     =WAR AND PEACE.= A Historical Novel, by Count Leon Tolstoi,\n     translated into French by a Russian Lady and from the French by\n     Clara Bell. _Authorized Edition._ Complete, Three Parts in Box.\n     Paper, $3.00.

It is a story of the\nfamily rather than of the field, and is charming in its delineations of\nquaint Russian customs. It is a novel of absorbing interest, full of\naction and with a well managed plot; a book well worth\nreading."--_Philadelphia Enquirer._\n\n"The story of \'War and Peace\' ranks as the greatest of Slavic historical\nnovels. It is intensely dramatic in places and the battle scenes are\nmarvels of picturesque description. At other points the vein is quiet\nand philosophical, and the reader is held by the soothing charm that is\nin complete contrast with the action and energy of battle."--_Observer,\nUtica, N.Y._\n\n"War and Peace is a historical novel and is extremely interesting, not\nonly in its description of the times of the great invasion eighty years\nago, but in its vivid pictures of life and character in\nRussia."--_Journal of Commerce, New York._\n\n"On general principles the historical novel is neither valuable as fact\nnor entertaining as fiction. But \'War and Peace\' is a striking exception\nto this rule. It deals with the most impressive and dramatic period of\nEuropean history. It reproduces a living panorama of scene, and actors,\nand circumstance idealized into the intense and artistic life of\nimaginative composition, and written with a brilliancy of style and\nepigrammatic play of thought, a depth of significance, that render the\nstory one of the most fascinating and absorbing."--_Boston Evening\nTraveller._\n\n_Wm.

One vol. Paper, 50\n     cts. Cloth binding. $1.00.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n"The Cossacks" forms the culmination of the period in which he\nphotographed with miraculous realism and no definite purpose, detached\npictures of life and studies of the affections, and the period in which\nhe began to see and suggest the spiritual meaning of and the chain of\nultimate purpose binding together the panorama of human existence. The\nbook is an idyl of semi-barbarous life and yet the hero begins to\nstruggle with the problems that puzzled Sergius, that Levin half solved,\nand from which Tolstoi himself escapes in a Quaker creed.\n\nOlenin is a young Russian noble whose career has simulated outwardly\nthat of his companions, but whose soul has been unsatisfied and empty,\ndriving him finally to break away from his old associations and go for a\ncampaign in the Caucasus. With that campaign the story does not concern\nitself, going on to its conclusion when the young man settles down in a\nCossack village to wait for his promotion. This portion of the book is\ninimitable for the slight, almost imperceptible touches through which\nTolstoi has the power, greater than that of any one else, of reproducing\nthe actual scene he wishes to transcribe. This power can scarcely be\ncalled realism. It might be better characterized as realization. It is\npossible in this way to know the exact life of this brave, indolent,\ngood-tempered, healthful race of half-Russians, half-Circassians, and to\nfeel the charm they possessed for Olenin. It is a curious fact that the\nmost civilized natures are most akin to barbarism. The simple directness\nof barbaric virtues, the healthy passion and aggressiveness of its vices\nmake the process of atavism easy to a nature that has risen above the\nmere materialism of civilization. The process of this reversion in\nOlenin is hastened, of course, by love for a Cossack woman, one of those\nclean-minded girls who think no harm in a kiss or caress, but whose\nvirtue is an absolute and natural thing that admits of no question or\ndiscussion. His love is not of the kind that could mean her dishonor,\nand he asks for Marianka\'s hand in marriage, feeling helplessly and\nhopelessly all the while that real union is impossible between\nthem--that though he can understand her and go down into her\nsemi-barbarism, she can never know him or appreciate the motives that\nimpel him to leave a state that she considers higher than her own. The\nstory ends abruptly and what is called by the professional novel-reader\n"unsatisfactorily." Marianka clings in preference to her Cossack lover,\nand Olenin feeling despairingly that this rude, simple, barbarous life\ncan never absorb, can only encyst him, goes rack to his duties at the\nfront.--_New York World._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n                                  THE\n\n                             EBERS GALLERY\n\n                       A COLLECTION OF PAINTINGS\n\n                            ILLUSTRATING THE\n\n                        ROMANCES OF GEORG EBERS\n\n                        BY THE FOLLOWING ARTISTS\n\n         L.

Price, paper\n     covers, $1.00, cloth binding, $1.75 per set.\n\n"This romance has much value, apart from its interest as a narrative.\nThe learned author, who has made the Land of the Nile an object of\nspecial study and research, throws a clear, steady light on one of those\ncomplicated periods of history when nationality seems submerged in the\nconflicting interests of sects and factions. The history of Egypt\ntowards the middle of the seventh century, A. D., forms a sort of\nhistorical whirlpool. The tide of Moslem invasion and the\ncounter-current of patriotism were temporarily swayed by the\nintermingling currents of sectarianism, ecclesiasticism and individual\nself-interest.\n\n"All the leading characters are typical of these contending forces, and\nalso display an unreasoning impulsiveness in both love and hatred,\ncharacteristic of a tropical clime.\n\n"The Egyptian heathen, the Egyptian Christian, the Greek Christian, the\nMoslem and Ethiopian show the feelings peculiar to their political\nconditions by word and act, thus making their relationship to one\nanother very distinct, and though not an historical study, at least a\nstudy of the probabilities of that epoch. It is also a reliable picture\nof the manners, customs and civilization of a period less generally\nknown than those remote, and consequently more attractive periods of the\nbuilding of the pyramids, and of the Pharoahs.\n\n"The portrayal of individual character and arrangement of incidents are\nnecessarily secondary to the higher aims of this entertaining and\ninstructive romance. It is only towards the end of the second volume\nthat the significance of the title becomes apparent. The \'Bride\' was a\nGreek Christian doomed by the superstitious authorities to be drowned in\nthe Nile as a sacrifice to appease the anger of the creative powers,\nsupposed to be withholding the usual overflow of its waters. She escaped\nher watery fate, and her rival, an unprincipled heiress, became a\nvoluntary sacrifice through vanity and despair. This author has already\nwon much renown by previous romances founded on interesting epochs of\nEgyptian history."--_Daily Alta, California._\n\n_William S.

Price, paper covers,\n     $1.00. Cloth binding, $1.75.\n\n"There must always be some difference of opinion concerning the right of\nthe romancer to treat of sacred events and to introduce sacred\npersonages into his story. Some hold that any attempt to embody an idea\nof our Saviour\'s character, experiences, sayings and teachings in the\nform of fiction must have the effect of lowering our imaginative ideal,\nand rendering trivial and common-place that which in the real Gospel is\nspontaneous, inspired and sublime. But to others an historical novel\nlike the \'Martyr of Golgotha\' comes like a revelation, opening fresh\nvistas of thought, filling out blanks and making clear what had hitherto\nbeen vague and unsatisfactory, quickening insight and sympathy, and\nactually heightening the conception of divine traits. The author gives\nalso a wide survey of the general history of the epoch and shows the\nvarious shaping causes which were influencing the rise and development\nof the new religion in Palestine. There is, indeed, an astonishing\nvitality and movement throughout the work, and, elaborate though the\nplot is, with all varieties and all contrasts of people and conditions,\nwith constant shiftings of the scene, the story yet moves, and moves the\ninterest of the reader too, along the rapid current of events towards\nthe powerful culmination. The writer uses the Catholic traditions, and\nin many points interprets the story in a way which differs altogether\nfrom that familiar to Protestants: for example, making Mary Magdalen the\nsame Mary who was the sister of Lazarus and Martha, and who sat\nlistening at the Saviour\'s feet. But in general, although there is a\nfree use made of Catholic legends and traditions, their effort is\nnatural and pleasing. The romance shows a degree of a southern fervor\nwhich is foreign to English habit, but the flowery, poetic\nstyle--although it at first repels the reader--is so individual, so much\na part of the author, that it is soon accepted as the naive expression\nof a mind kindled and carried away by its subject. Spanish literature\nhas of late given us a variety of novels and romances, all of which are\nin their way so good that we must believe that there is a new generation\nof writers in Spain who are discarding the worn-out forms and\ntraditions, and are putting fresh life and energy into works which will\ngive pleasure to the whole world of readers."--_Philadelphia American_,\nMarch 5, 1887.\n\n_William S.

Authorized edition. In two\n     vols. Paper, $1.00. Cloth, $1.75.\n\n"The date of \'Prusias\' is the latter half of the first century B. C.\nRome is waging her tedious war with Mithridates. There are also risings\nin Spain, and the home army is badly depleted. Prusias comes to Capua as\na learned Armenian, the tutor of a noble pupil in one of the\naristocratic households. Each member of this circle is distinct. Some of\nthe most splendid traits of human nature develop among these grand\nstatesmen and their dignified wives, mothers, and daughters. The ideal\nRoman maiden is Psyche; but she has a trace of Greek blood and of the\nnative gentleness. Of a more interesting type is Fannia, who might,\nminus her slaves and stola, pass for a modern and saucy New York beauty.\nHer wit, spirit, selfishness, and impulsive magnanimity might easily\nhave been a nineteenth-century evolution. In the family to which Prusias\ncomes are two sons, one of military leanings, the other a student. Into\nthe ear of the latter Prusias whispers the real purpose of his coming to\nItaly. He is an Armenian and in league with Mithridates for the\nreduction of Roman rule. The unity which the Senate has tried to extend\nto the freshly-conquered provinces of Italy is a thing of slow growth.\nPrusias by his strategy and helped by Mithridates\'s gold, hopes to\norganize slaves and disaffected provincials into a force which will\noblige weakened Rome to make terms, one of which shall be complete\nemancipation and equality of every man before the law. His harangues are\nin lofty strain, and, save that he never takes the coarse, belligerent\ntone of our contemporaries, these speeches might have been made by one\nof our own Abolitionists. The one point that Prusias never forgets is\npersonal dignity and a regal consideration for his friends. But after\nall, this son of the gods is befooled by a woman, a sinuous and\ntranscendently ambitious Roman belle, the second wife of the dull and\ntrustful prefect of Capua; for this tiny woman had all men in her net\nwhom she found it useful to have there.\n\n"The daughter of the prefect--hard, homely-featured, and hating the\nsupple stepmother with an unspeakable hate, tearing her beauty at last\nlike a tigress and so causing her death--is a repulsive but very strong\nfigure. The two brothers who range themselves on opposite sides in the\nservile war make another unforgettable picture; and the beautiful slave\nBrenna, who follows her noble lover into camp, is a spark of light\nagainst the lurid background. The servile movement is combined with the\nbold plans of the Thracian Spartacus. He is a good figure and\nperpetually surprises us with his keen foresight and disciplinary power.\n\n"The book is stirring, realistic in the even German way, and full of the\nfibre and breath of its century." _Boston Ev\'g Transcript._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n     =THE WILL.=--A NOVEL, by =Ernst Eckstein=, from the German by Clara\n     Bell, in two vols.

The\nnarrative of M\'lle Adela\'s adventures is blithely told, and the moral\ndeducible therefrom for men is that, on occasion, flight is the surest\nmethod of combating temptation."--_Art Interchange, New York._\n\n"Very entertaining is the story of \'The Eleventh Commandment,\'\ningeniously conceived and very cleverly executed."--_The Critic, New\nYork._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n     =A WHIMSICAL WOOING.=--By =Anton Giulio Barrili=, from the Italian by\n     Clara Bell, in one vol.

It is\none situation, a single catastrophe, yet, like a bit of impressionist\npainting of the finer sort, it reveals in a flash all the possibilities\nof the scene. The hero, Roberto Fenoglio, a man of wealth, position, and\naccomplishments, finds himself at the end of his resources for\nentertainment or interest. Hopelessly bored, he abandons himself to the\ndrift of chance, and finds himself, in no longer space of time than from\nmidnight to daylight--where and how, the reader will thank us for not\nforestalling his pleasure in finding out for himself."--_The Nation, New\nYork._\n\n"\'A Whimsical Wooing\' is the richly-expressive title under which \'Clara\nBell\' introduces a cleverly-narrated episode by Anton Giulio Barrili to\nAmerican readers. It is a sketch of Italian life, at once rich and\nstrong, but nevertheless discreet in sentiment and graceful in diction.\nIt is the old story of the fallacy of trusting to a proxy in love\nmatters."--_Boston Post._\n\n_William S.

It has the full flavor\nof old German and English love tales, such as have been crystallized in\nthe old ballads. The Emperor, the gifted boy, his struggles with the\nstupidity of his townsmen, his apparently hopeless love above him; these\nform the old delightful scene, set in a Duereresque border. There are\ntouches here and there which refer to the present.

No study has made us so familiar with\nthe age of Pericles. We recognize throughout that the author is master\nof the period of which he treats. Moreover, looking back upon the work\nfrom the end to the beginning, we clearly perceive in it a complete\nunity of purpose not at all evident during the reading."\n\n"Hamerling\'s Aspasia, herself the most beautiful woman in all Hellas, is\nthe apostle of beauty and of joyousness, the implacable enemy of all\nthat is stern and harsh in life. Unfortunately, morality is stern, and\nhad no place among Aspasia\'s doctrines. This ugly fact, Landor has\nthrust as far into the background as possible. Hamerling obtrudes it. He\ndoes not moralize, he neither condemns nor praises; but like a fate,\nsilent, passionless, and resistless, he carries the story along, allows\nthe sunshine for a time to silver the turbid stream, the butterflies and\ngnats to flutter above it in rainbow tints, and then remorselessly draws\nover the landscape gray twilight.
