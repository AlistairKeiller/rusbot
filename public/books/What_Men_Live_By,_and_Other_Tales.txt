Work was cheap, but bread was dear, and what he\nearned he spent for food. The man and his wife had but one sheepskin\ncoat between them for winter wear, and even that was torn to tatters,\nand this was the second year he had been wanting to buy sheep-skins for\na new coat. Before winter Simon saved up a little money: a three-rouble\nnote lay hidden in his wife\'s box, and five roubles and twenty kopeks\nwere owed him by customers in the village.\n\nSo one morning he prepared to go to the village to buy the sheep-skins.\nHe put on over his shirt his wife\'s wadded nankeen jacket, and over that\nhe put his own cloth coat. He took the three-rouble note in his\npocket, cut himself a stick to serve as a staff, and started off after\nbreakfast. "I\'ll collect the five roubles that are due to me,"\nthought he, "add the three I have got, and that will be enough to buy\nsheep-skins for the winter coat."\n\nHe came to the village and called at a peasant\'s hut, but the man was\nnot at home. The peasant\'s wife promised that the money should be\npaid next week, but she would not pay it herself. Then Simon called on\nanother peasant, but this one swore he had no money, and would only pay\ntwenty kopeks which he owed for a pair of boots Simon had mended. Simon\nthen tried to buy the sheep-skins on credit, but the dealer would not\ntrust him.\n\n"Bring your money," said he, "then you may have your pick of the skins.\nWe know what debt-collecting is like." So all the business the shoemaker\ndid was to get the twenty kopeks for boots he had mended, and to take a\npair of felt boots a peasant gave him to sole with leather.\n\nSimon felt downhearted. He spent the twenty kopeks on vodka, and started\nhomewards without having bought any skins. In the morning he had felt\nthe frost; but now, after drinking the vodka, he felt warm, even without\na sheep-skin coat. He trudged along, striking his stick on the frozen\nearth with one hand, swinging the felt boots with the other, and talking\nto himself.\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n"I\'m quite warm," said he, "though I have no sheep-skin coat. I\'ve had\na drop, and it runs through all my veins. I need no sheep-skins. I go\nalong and don\'t worry about anything. That\'s the sort of man I am! What\ndo I care? I can live without sheep-skins. I don\'t need them. My wife\nwill fret, to be sure. And, true enough, it is a shame; one works all\nday long, and then does not get paid. Stop a bit! If you don\'t bring\nthat money along, sure enough I\'ll skin you, blessed if I don\'t. How\'s\nthat? He pays twenty kopeks at a time! What can I do with twenty kopeks?\nDrink it-that\'s all one can do! Hard up, he says he is! So he may\nbe--but what about me? You have a house, and cattle, and everything;\nI\'ve only what I stand up in! You have corn of your own growing; I have\nto buy every grain. Do what I will, I must spend three roubles every\nweek for bread alone. I come home and find the bread all used up, and I\nhave to fork out another rouble and a half. So just pay up what you owe,\nand no nonsense about it!"\n\nBy this time he had nearly reached the shrine at the bend of the road.\nLooking up, he saw something whitish behind the shrine. The daylight was\nfading, and the shoemaker peered at the thing without being able to make\nout what it was. "There was no white stone here before. Can it be an ox?\nIt\'s not like an ox. It has a head like a man, but it\'s too white; and\nwhat could a man be doing there?"\n\nHe came closer, so that it was clearly visible. To his surprise it\nreally was a man, alive or dead, sitting naked, leaning motionless\nagainst the shrine. Terror seized the shoemaker, and he thought, "Some\none has killed him, stripped him, and left him there. If I meddle I\nshall surely get into trouble."\n\nSo the shoemaker went on. He passed in front of the shrine so that he\ncould not see the man. When he had gone some way, he looked back, and\nsaw that the man was no longer leaning against the shrine, but was\nmoving as if looking towards him. The shoemaker felt more frightened\nthan before, and thought, "Shall I go back to him, or shall I go on? If\nI go near him something dreadful may happen. Who knows who the fellow\nis? He has not come here for any good. If I go near him he may jump\nup and throttle me, and there will be no getting away. Or if not, he\'d\nstill be a burden on one\'s hands. What could I do with a naked man? I\ncouldn\'t give him my last clothes. Heaven only help me to get away!"\n\nSo the shoemaker hurried on, leaving the shrine behind him-when suddenly\nhis conscience smote him, and he stopped in the road.\n\n"What are you doing, Simon?" said he to himself. "The man may be dying\nof want, and you slip past afraid. Have you grown so rich as to be\nafraid of robbers? Ah, Simon, shame on you!"\n\nSo he turned back and went up to the man.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nSimon approached the stranger, looked at him, and saw that he was a\nyoung man, fit, with no bruises on his body, only evidently freezing and\nfrightened, and he sat there leaning back without looking up at Simon,\nas if too faint to lift his eyes. Simon went close to him, and then the\nman seemed to wake up. Turning his head, he opened his eyes and looked\ninto Simon\'s face. That one look was enough to make Simon fond of the\nman. He threw the felt boots on the ground, undid his sash, laid it on\nthe boots, and took off his cloth coat.\n\n"It\'s not a time for talking," said he. "Come, put this coat on at\nonce!" And Simon took the man by the elbows and helped him to rise. As\nhe stood there, Simon saw that his body was clean and in good condition,\nhis hands and feet shapely, and his face good and kind. He threw\nhis coat over the man\'s shoulders, but the latter could not find the\nsleeves. Simon guided his arms into them, and drawing the coat well on,\nwrapped it closely about him, tying the sash round the man\'s waist.\n\nSimon even took off his torn cap to put it on the man\'s head, but then\nhis own head felt cold, and he thought: "I\'m quite bald, while he has\nlong curly hair." So he put his cap on his own head again. "It will be\nbetter to give him something for his feet," thought he; and he made the\nman sit down, and helped him to put on the felt boots, saying, "There,\nfriend, now move about and warm yourself. Other matters can be settled\nlater on. Can you walk?"\n\nThe man stood up and looked kindly at Simon, but could not say a word.\n\n"Why don\'t you speak?" said Simon. "It\'s too cold to stay here, we must\nbe getting home. There now, take my stick, and if you\'re feeling weak,\nlean on that. Now step out!"\n\nThe man started walking, and moved easily, not lagging behind.\n\nAs they went along, Simon asked him, "And where do you belong to?" "I\'m\nnot from these parts."\n\n"I thought as much. I know the folks hereabouts. But, how did you come\nto be there by the shrine?"\n\n"I cannot tell."\n\n"Has some one been ill-treating you?"\n\n"No one has ill-treated me. God has punished me."\n\n"Of course God rules all. Still, you\'ll have to find food and shelter\nsomewhere. Where do you want to go to?"\n\n"It is all the same to me."\n\nSimon was amazed. The man did not look like a rogue, and he spoke\ngently, but yet he gave no account of himself. Still Simon thought, "Who\nknows what may have happened?" And he said to the stranger: "Well then,\ncome home with me, and at least warm yourself awhile."\n\nSo Simon walked towards his home, and the stranger kept up with him,\nwalking at his side. The wind had risen and Simon felt it cold under his\nshirt. He was getting over his tipsiness by now, and began to feel the\nfrost. He went along sniffling and wrapping his wife\'s coat round him,\nand he thought to himself: "There now--talk about sheep-skins! I went\nout for sheep-skins and come home without even a coat to my back, and\nwhat is more, I\'m bringing a naked man along with me. Matryona won\'t\nbe pleased!" And when he thought of his wife he felt sad; but when he\nlooked at the stranger and remembered how he had looked up at him at the\nshrine, his heart was glad.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nSimon\'s wife had everything ready early that day. She had cut wood,\nbrought water, fed the children, eaten her own meal, and now she sat\nthinking. She wondered when she ought to make bread: now or tomorrow?\nThere was still a large piece left.\n\n"If Simon has had some dinner in town," thought she, "and does not eat\nmuch for supper, the bread will last out another day."\n\nShe weighed the piece of bread in her hand again and again, and thought:\n"I won\'t make any more today. We have only enough flour left to bake one\nbatch; We can manage to make this last out till Friday."\n\nSo Matryona put away the bread, and sat down at the table to patch her\nhusband\'s shirt. While she worked she thought how her husband was buying\nskins for a winter coat.\n\n"If only the dealer does not cheat him. My good man is much too simple;\nhe cheats nobody, but any child can take him in. Eight roubles is a lot\nof money--he should get a good coat at that price. Not tanned skins, but\nstill a proper winter coat. How difficult it was last winter to get on\nwithout a warm coat. I could neither get down to the river, nor go out\nanywhere. When he went out he put on all we had, and there was nothing\nleft for me. He did not start very early today, but still it\'s time he\nwas back. I only hope he has not gone on the spree!"\n\nHardly had Matryona thought this, when steps were heard on the\nthreshold, and some one entered. Matryona stuck her needle into her work\nand went out into the passage. There she saw two men: Simon, and with\nhim a man without a hat, and wearing felt boots.\n\nMatryona noticed at once that her husband smelt of spirits. "There\nnow, he has been drinking," thought she. And when she saw that he was\ncoatless, had only her jacket on, brought no parcel, stood there silent,\nand seemed ashamed, her heart was ready to break with disappointment.\n"He has drunk the money," thought she, "and has been on the spree with\nsome good-for-nothing fellow whom he has brought home with him."\n\nMatryona let them pass into the hut, followed them in, and saw that the\nstranger was a young, slight man, wearing her husband\'s coat. There\nwas no shirt to be seen under it, and he had no hat. Having entered, he\nstood, neither moving, nor raising his eyes, and Matryona thought: "He\nmust be a bad man--he\'s afraid."\n\nMatryona frowned, and stood beside the oven looking to see what they\nwould do.\n\nSimon took off his cap and sat down on the bench as if things were all\nright.\n\n"Come, Matryona; if supper is ready, let us have some."\n\nMatryona muttered something to herself and did not move, but stayed\nwhere she was, by the oven. She looked first at the one and then at\nthe other of them, and only shook her head. Simon saw that his wife was\nannoyed, but tried to pass it off. Pretending not to notice anything, he\ntook the stranger by the arm.\n\n"Sit down, friend," said he, "and let us have some supper."\n\nThe stranger sat down on the bench.\n\n"Haven\'t you cooked anything for us?" said Simon.\n\nMatryona\'s anger boiled over. "I\'ve cooked, but not for you. It seems to\nme you have drunk your wits away. You went to buy a sheep-skin coat,\nbut come home without so much as the coat you had on, and bring a naked\nvagabond home with you. I have no supper for drunkards like you."\n\n"That\'s enough, Matryona. Don\'t wag your tongue without reason. You had\nbetter ask what sort of man--"\n\n"And you tell me what you\'ve done with the money?"\n\nSimon found the pocket of the jacket, drew out the three-rouble note,\nand unfolded it.\n\n"Here is the money. Trifonof did not pay, but promises to pay soon."\n\nMatryona got still more angry; he had bought no sheep-skins, but had\nput his only coat on some naked fellow and had even brought him to their\nhouse.\n\nShe snatched up the note from the table, took it to put away in safety,\nand said: "I have no supper for you. We can\'t feed all the naked\ndrunkards in the world."\n\n"There now, Matryona, hold your tongue a bit. First hear what a man has\nto say-"\n\n"Much wisdom I shall hear from a drunken fool. I was right in not\nwanting to marry you-a drunkard. The linen my mother gave me you drank;\nand now you\'ve been to buy a coat-and have drunk it, too!"\n\nSimon tried to explain to his wife that he had only spent twenty kopeks;\ntried to tell how he had found the man--but Matryona would not let him\nget a word in. She talked nineteen to the dozen, and dragged in things\nthat had happened ten years before.\n\nMatryona talked and talked, and at last she flew at Simon and seized him\nby the sleeve.\n\n"Give me my jacket. It is the only one I have, and you must needs take\nit from me and wear it yourself. Give it here, you mangy dog, and may\nthe devil take you."\n\nSimon began to pull off the jacket, and turned a sleeve of it inside\nout; Matryona seized the jacket and it burst its seams, She snatched it\nup, threw it over her head and went to the door. She meant to go out,\nbut stopped undecided--she wanted to work off her anger, but she also\nwanted to learn what sort of a man the stranger was.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nMatryona stopped and said: "If he were a good man he would not be naked.\nWhy, he hasn\'t even a shirt on him. If he were all right, you would say\nwhere you came across the fellow."\n\n"That\'s just what I am trying to tell you," said Simon. "As I came to\nthe shrine I saw him sitting all naked and frozen. It isn\'t quite\nthe weather to sit about naked! God sent me to him, or he would have\nperished. What was I to do? How do we know what may have happened to\nhim? So I took him, clothed him, and brought him along. Don\'t be so\nangry, Matryona. It is a sin. Remember, we all must die one day."\n\nAngry words rose to Matryona\'s lips, but she looked at the stranger\nand was silent. He sat on the edge of the bench, motionless, his hands\nfolded on his knees, his head drooping on his breast, his eyes closed,\nand his brows knit as if in pain. Matryona was silent: and Simon said:\n"Matryona, have you no love of God?"\n\nMatryona heard these words, and as she looked at the stranger, suddenly\nher heart softened towards him. She came back from the door, and going\nto the oven she got out the supper. Setting a cup on the table, she\npoured out some kvas. Then she brought out the last piece of bread, and\nset out a knife and spoons.\n\n"Eat, if you want to," said she.\n\nSimon drew the stranger to the table.\n\n"Take your place, young man," said he.\n\nSimon cut the bread, crumbled it into the broth, and they began to eat.\nMatryona sat at the corner of the table resting her head on her hand and\nlooking at the stranger.\n\nAnd Matryona was touched with pity for the stranger, and began to feel\nfond of him. And at once the stranger\'s face lit up; his brows were no\nlonger bent, he raised his eyes and smiled at Matryona.\n\nWhen they had finished supper, the woman cleared away the things and\nbegan questioning the stranger. "Where are you from?" said she.\n\n"I am not from these parts."\n\n"But how did you come to be on the road?"\n\n"I may not tell."\n\n"Did some one rob you?"\n\n"God punished me."\n\n"And you were lying there naked?"\n\n"Yes, naked and freezing. Simon saw me and had pity on me. He took off\nhis coat, put it on me and brought me here. And you have fed me, given\nme drink, and shown pity on me. God will reward you!"\n\nMatryona rose, took from the window Simon\'s old shirt she had been\npatching, and gave it to the stranger. She also brought out a pair of\ntrousers for him.\n\n"There," said she, "I see you have no shirt. Put this on, and lie down\nwhere you please, in the loft or on the oven."\n\nThe stranger took off the coat, put on the shirt, and lay down in the\nloft. Matryona put out the candle, took the coat, and climbed to where\nher husband lay.\n\nMatryona drew the skirts of the coat over her and lay down, but could\nnot sleep; she could not get the stranger out of her mind.\n\nWhen she remembered that he had eaten their last piece of bread and that\nthere was none for tomorrow, and thought of the shirt and trousers she\nhad given away, she felt grieved; but when she remembered how he had\nsmiled, her heart was glad.\n\nLong did Matryona lie awake, and she noticed that Simon also was\nawake--he drew the coat towards him.\n\n"Simon!"\n\n"Well?"\n\n"You have had the last of the bread, and I have not put any to rise.\nI don\'t know what we shall do tomorrow. Perhaps I can borrow some of\nneighbor Martha."\n\n"If we\'re alive we shall find something to eat."\n\nThe woman lay still awhile, and then said, "He seems a good man, but why\ndoes he not tell us who he is?"\n\n"I suppose he has his reasons."\n\n"Simon!"\n\n"Well?"\n\n"We give; but why does nobody give us anything?"\n\nSimon did not know what to say; so he only said, "Let us stop talking,"\nand turned over and went to sleep.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nIn the morning Simon awoke. The children were still asleep; his wife\nhad gone to the neighbor\'s to borrow some bread. The stranger alone was\nsitting on the bench, dressed in the old shirt and trousers, and looking\nupwards. His face was brighter than it had been the day before.\n\nSimon said to him, "Well, friend; the belly wants bread, and the naked\nbody clothes. One has to work for a living What work do you know?"\n\n"I do not know any."\n\nThis surprised Simon, but he said, "Men who want to learn can learn\nanything."\n\n"Men work, and I will work also."\n\n"What is your name?"\n\n"Michael."\n\n"Well, Michael, if you don\'t wish to talk about yourself, that is your\nown affair; but you\'ll have to earn a living for yourself. If you will\nwork as I tell you, I will give you food and shelter."\n\n"May God reward you! I will learn. Show me what to do."\n\nSimon took yarn, put it round his thumb and began to twist it.\n\n"It is easy enough--see!"\n\nMichael watched him, put some yarn round his own thumb in the same way,\ncaught the knack, and twisted the yarn also.\n\nThen Simon showed him how to wax the thread. This also Michael mastered.\nNext Simon showed him how to twist the bristle in, and how to sew, and\nthis, too, Michael learned at once.\n\nWhatever Simon showed him he understood at once, and after three days he\nworked as if he had sewn boots all his life. He worked without stopping,\nand ate little. When work was over he sat silently, looking upwards.\nHe hardly went into the street, spoke only when necessary, and neither\njoked nor laughed. They never saw him smile, except that first evening\nwhen Matryona gave them supper.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nDay by day and week by week the year went round. Michael lived and\nworked with Simon. His fame spread till people said that no one sewed\nboots so neatly and strongly as Simon\'s workman, Michael; and from all\nthe district round people came to Simon for their boots, and he began to\nbe well off.\n\nOne winter day, as Simon and Michael sat working, a carriage on\nsledge-runners, with three horses and with bells, drove up to the hut.\nThey looked out of the window; the carriage stopped at their door, a\nfine servant jumped down from the box and opened the door. A gentleman\nin a fur coat got out and walked up to Simon\'s hut. Up jumped Matryona\nand opened the door wide. The gentleman stooped to enter the hut, and\nwhen he drew himself up again his head nearly reached the ceiling, and\nhe seemed quite to fill his end of the room.\n\nSimon rose, bowed, and looked at the gentleman with astonishment. He had\nnever seen any one like him. Simon himself was lean, Michael was thin,\nand Matryona was dry as a bone, but this man was like some one from\nanother world: red-faced, burly, with a neck like a bull\'s, and looking\naltogether as if he were cast in iron.\n\nThe gentleman puffed, threw off his fur coat, sat down on the bench, and\nsaid, "Which of you is the master bootmaker?"\n\n"I am, your Excellency," said Simon, coming forward.\n\nThen the gentleman shouted to his lad, "Hey, Fedka, bring the leather!"\n\nThe servant ran in, bringing a parcel. The gentleman took the parcel and\nput it on the table.\n\n"Untie it," said he. The lad untied it.\n\nThe gentleman pointed to the leather.\n\n"Look here, shoemaker," said he, "do you see this leather?"\n\n"Yes, your honor."\n\n"But do you know what sort of leather it is?"\n\nSimon felt the leather and said, "It is good leather."\n\n"Good, indeed! Why, you fool, you never saw such leather before in your\nlife. It\'s German, and cost twenty roubles."\n\nSimon was frightened, and said, "Where should I ever see leather like\nthat?"\n\n"Just so! Now, can you make it into boots for me?"\n\n"Yes, your Excellency, I can."\n\nThen the gentleman shouted at him: "You can, can you? Well, remember\nwhom you are to make them for, and what the leather is. You must make me\nboots that will wear for a year, neither losing shape nor coming unsown.\nIf you can do it, take the leather and cut it up; but if you can\'t, say\nso. I warn you now if your boots become unsewn or lose shape within a\nyear, I will have you put in prison. If they don\'t burst or lose shape\nfor a year I will pay you ten roubles for your work."\n\nSimon was frightened, and did not know what to say. He glanced at\nMichael and nudging him with his elbow, whispered: "Shall I take the\nwork?"\n\nMichael nodded his head as if to say, "Yes, take it."\n\nSimon did as Michael advised, and undertook to make boots that would not\nlose shape or split for a whole year.\n\nCalling his servant, the gentleman told him to pull the boot off his\nleft leg, which he stretched out.\n\n"Take my measure!" said he.\n\nSimon stitched a paper measure seventeen inches long, smoothed it out,\nknelt down, wiped his hand well on his apron so as not to soil the\ngentleman\'s sock, and began to measure. He measured the sole, and round\nthe instep, and began to measure the calf of the leg, but the paper was\ntoo short. The calf of the leg was as thick as a beam.\n\n"Mind you don\'t make it too tight in the leg."\n\nSimon stitched on another strip of paper. The gentleman twitched his\ntoes about in his sock, looking round at those in the hut, and as he did\nso he noticed Michael.\n\n"Whom have you there?" asked he.\n\n"That is my workman. He will sew the boots."\n\n"Mind," said the gentleman to Michael, "remember to make them so that\nthey will last me a year."\n\nSimon also looked at Michael, and saw that Michael was not looking at\nthe gentleman, but was gazing into the corner behind the gentleman, as\nif he saw some one there. Michael looked and looked, and suddenly he\nsmiled, and his face became brighter.\n\n"What are you grinning at, you fool?" thundered the gentleman. "You had\nbetter look to it that the boots are ready in time."\n\n"They shall be ready in good time," said Michael.\n\n"Mind it is so," said the gentleman, and he put on his boots and his fur\ncoat, wrapped the latter round him, and went to the door. But he forgot\nto stoop, and struck his head against the lintel.\n\nHe swore and rubbed his head. Then he took his seat in the carriage and\ndrove away.\n\nWhen he had gone, Simon said: "There\'s a figure of a man for you! You\ncould not kill him with a mallet. He almost knocked out the lintel, but\nlittle harm it did him."\n\nAnd Matryona said: "Living as he does, how should he not grow strong?\nDeath itself can\'t touch such a rock as that."\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nThen Simon said to Michael: "Well, we have taken the work, but we must\nsee we don\'t get into trouble over it. The leather is dear, and the\ngentleman hot-tempered. We must make no mistakes. Come, your eye is\ntruer and your hands have become nimbler than mine, so you take this\nmeasure and cut out the boots. I will finish off the sewing of the\nvamps."\n\nMichael did as he was told. He took the leather, spread it out on the\ntable, folded it in two, took a knife and began to cut out.\n\nMatryona came and watched him cutting, and was surprised to see how\nhe was doing it. Matryona was accustomed to seeing boots made, and she\nlooked and saw that Michael was not cutting the leather for boots, but\nwas cutting it round.\n\nShe wished to say something, but she thought to herself: "Perhaps I do\nnot understand how gentleman\'s boots should be made. I suppose Michael\nknows more about it--and I won\'t interfere."\n\nWhen Michael had cut up the leather, he took a thread and began to sew\nnot with two ends, as boots are sewn, but with a single end, as for soft\nslippers.\n\nAgain Matryona wondered, but again she did not interfere. Michael sewed\non steadily till noon. Then Simon rose for dinner, looked around, and\nsaw that Michael had made slippers out of the gentleman\'s leather.\n\n"Ah," groaned Simon, and he thought, "How is it that Michael, who has\nbeen with me a whole year and never made a mistake before, should do\nsuch a dreadful thing? The gentleman ordered high boots, welted, with\nwhole fronts, and Michael has made soft slippers with single soles, and\nhas wasted the leather. What am I to say to the gentleman? I can never\nreplace leather such as this."\n\nAnd he said to Michael, "What are you doing, friend? You have ruined me!\nYou know the gentleman ordered high boots, but see what you have made!"\n\nHardly had he begun to rebuke Michael, when "rat-tat" went the iron ring\nthat hung at the door. Some one was knocking. They looked out of the\nwindow; a man had come on horseback, and was fastening his horse. They\nopened the door, and the servant who had been with the gentleman came\nin.\n\n"Good day," said he.\n\n"Good day," replied Simon. "What can we do for you?"\n\n"My mistress has sent me about the boots."\n\n"What about the boots?"\n\n"Why, my master no longer needs them. He is dead."\n\n"Is it possible?"\n\n"He did not live to get home after leaving you, but died in the\ncarriage. When we reached home and the servants came to help him alight,\nhe rolled over like a sack. He was dead already, and so stiff that\nhe could hardly be got out of the carriage. My mistress sent me here,\nsaying: \'Tell the bootmaker that the gentleman who ordered boots of him\nand left the leather for them no longer needs the boots, but that he\nmust quickly make soft slippers for the corpse. Wait till they are\nready, and bring them back with you.\' That is why I have come."\n\nMichael gathered up the remnants of the leather; rolled them up, took\nthe soft slippers he had made, slapped them together, wiped them down\nwith his apron, and handed them and the roll of leather to the servant,\nwho took them and said: "Good-bye, masters, and good day to you!"\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nAnother year passed, and another, and Michael was now living his sixth\nyear with Simon. He lived as before. He went nowhere, only spoke when\nnecessary, and had only smiled twice in all those years--once when\nMatryona gave him food, and a second time when the gentleman was in\ntheir hut. Simon was more than pleased with his workman. He never now\nasked him where he came from, and only feared lest Michael should go\naway.\n\nThey were all at home one day. Matryona was putting iron pots in the\noven; the children were running along the benches and looking out of the\nwindow; Simon was sewing at one window, and Michael was fastening on a\nheel at the other.\n\nOne of the boys ran along the bench to Michael, leant on his shoulder,\nand looked out of the window.\n\n"Look, Uncle Michael! There is a lady with little girls! She seems to be\ncoming here. And one of the girls is lame."\n\nWhen the boy said that, Michael dropped his work, turned to the window,\nand looked out into the street.\n\nSimon was surprised. Michael never used to look out into the street,\nbut now he pressed against the window, staring at something. Simon also\nlooked out, and saw that a well-dressed woman was really coming to\nhis hut, leading by the hand two little girls in fur coats and woolen\nshawls. The girls could hardly be told one from the other, except that\none of them was crippled in her left leg and walked with a limp.\n\nThe woman stepped into the porch and entered the passage. Feeling about\nfor the entrance she found the latch, which she lifted, and opened the\ndoor. She let the two girls go in first, and followed them into the hut.\n\n"Good day, good folk!"\n\n"Pray come in," said Simon. "What can we do for you?"\n\nThe woman sat down by the table. The two little girls pressed close to\nher knees, afraid of the people in the hut.\n\n"I want leather shoes made for these two little girls for spring."\n\n"We can do that. We never have made such small shoes, but we can make\nthem; either welted or turnover shoes, linen lined. My man, Michael, is\na master at the work."\n\nSimon glanced at Michael and saw that he had left his work and was\nsitting with his eyes fixed on the little girls. Simon was surprised.\nIt was true the girls were pretty, with black eyes, plump, and\nrosy-cheeked, and they wore nice kerchiefs and fur coats, but still\nSimon could not understand why Michael should look at them like\nthat--just as if he had known them before. He was puzzled, but went on\ntalking with the woman, and arranging the price. Having fixed it, he\nprepared the measure. The woman lifted the lame girl on to her lap and\nsaid: "Take two measures from this little girl. Make one shoe for the\nlame foot and three for the sound one. They both have the same size\nfeet. They are twins."\n\nSimon took the measure and, speaking of the lame girl, said: "How did it\nhappen to her? She is such a pretty girl. Was she born so?"\n\n"No, her mother crushed her leg."\n\nThen Matryona joined in. She wondered who this woman was, and whose the\nchildren were, so she said: "Are not you their mother then?"\n\n"No, my good woman; I am neither their mother nor any relation to them.\nThey were quite strangers to me, but I adopted them."\n\n"They are not your children and yet you are so fond of them?"\n\n"How can I help being fond of them? I fed them both at my own breasts.\nI had a child of my own, but God took him. I was not so fond of him as I\nnow am of them."\n\n"Then whose children are they?"\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\nThe woman, having begun talking, told them the whole story.\n\n"It is about six years since their parents died, both in one week: their\nfather was buried on the Tuesday, and their mother died on the Friday.\nThese orphans were born three days after their father\'s death, and their\nmother did not live another day. My husband and I were then living as\npeasants in the village. We were neighbors of theirs, our yard being\nnext to theirs. Their father was a lonely man; a wood-cutter in the\nforest. When felling trees one day, they let one fall on him. It fell\nacross his body and crushed his bowels out. They hardly got him home\nbefore his soul went to God; and that same week his wife gave birth to\ntwins--these little girls. She was poor and alone; she had no one,\nyoung or old, with her. Alone she gave them birth, and alone she met her\ndeath."\n\n"The next morning I went to see her, but when I entered the hut, she,\npoor thing, was already stark and cold. In dying she had rolled on to\nthis child and crushed her leg. The village folk came to the hut, washed\nthe body, laid her out, made a coffin, and buried her. They were good\nfolk. The babies were left alone. What was to be done with them? I\nwas the only woman there who had a baby at the time. I was nursing my\nfirst-born--eight weeks old. So I took them for a time. The peasants\ncame together, and thought and thought what to do with them; and at last\nthey said to me: \'For the present, Mary, you had better keep the girls,\nand later on we will arrange what to do for them.\' So I nursed the sound\none at my breast, but at first I did not feed this crippled one. I did\nnot suppose she would live. But then I thought to myself, why should the\npoor innocent suffer? I pitied her, and began to feed her. And so I fed\nmy own boy and these two--the three of them--at my own breast. I was\nyoung and strong, and had good food, and God gave me so much milk that\nat times it even overflowed. I used sometimes to feed two at a time,\nwhile the third was waiting. When one had enough I nursed the third. And\nGod so ordered it that these grew up, while my own was buried before he\nwas two years old. And I had no more children, though we prospered.\nNow my husband is working for the corn merchant at the mill. The pay\nis good, and we are well off. But I have no children of my own, and how\nlonely I should be without these little girls! How can I help loving\nthem! They are the joy of my life!"\n\nShe pressed the lame little girl to her with one hand, while with the\nother she wiped the tears from her cheeks.\n\nAnd Matryona sighed, and said: "The proverb is true that says, \'One may\nlive without father or mother, but one cannot live without God.\'"\n\nSo they talked together, when suddenly the whole hut was lighted up as\nthough by summer lightning from the corner where Michael sat. They all\nlooked towards him and saw him sitting, his hands folded on his knees,\ngazing upwards and smiling.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\nThe woman went away with the girls. Michael rose from the bench, put\ndown his work, and took off his apron. Then, bowing low to Simon and\nhis wife, he said: "Farewell, masters. God has forgiven me. I ask your\nforgiveness, too, for anything done amiss."\n\nAnd they saw that a light shone from Michael. And Simon rose, bowed down\nto Michael, and said: "I see, Michael, that you are no common man, and I\ncan neither keep you nor question you. Only tell me this: how is it that\nwhen I found you and brought you home, you were gloomy, and when my\nwife gave you food you smiled at her and became brighter? Then when the\ngentleman came to order the boots, you smiled again and became brighter\nstill? And now, when this woman brought the little girls, you smiled a\nthird time, and have become as bright as day? Tell me, Michael, why does\nyour face shine so, and why did you smile those three times?"\n\nAnd Michael answered: "Light shines from me because I have been\npunished, but now God has pardoned me. And I smiled three times, because\nGod sent me to learn three truths, and I have learnt them. One I learnt\nwhen your wife pitied me, and that is why I smiled the first time. The\nsecond I learnt when the rich man ordered the boots, and then I smiled\nagain. And now, when I saw those little girls, I learn the third and\nlast truth, and I smiled the third time."\n\nAnd Simon said, "Tell me, Michael, what did God punish you for? and what\nwere the three truths? that I, too, may know them."\n\nAnd Michael answered: "God punished me for disobeying Him. I was an\nangel in heaven and disobeyed God. God sent me to fetch a woman\'s soul.\nI flew to earth, and saw a sick woman lying alone, who had just given\nbirth to twin girls. They moved feebly at their mother\'s side, but she\ncould not lift them to her breast. When she saw me, she understood that\nGod had sent me for her soul, and she wept and said: \'Angel of God! My\nhusband has just been buried, killed by a falling tree. I have neither\nsister, nor aunt, nor mother: no one to care for my orphans. Do not take\nmy soul! Let me nurse my babes, feed them, and set them on their feet\nbefore I die. Children cannot live without father or mother.\' And I\nhearkened to her. I placed one child at her breast and gave the other\ninto her arms, and returned to the Lord in heaven. I flew to the Lord,\nand said: \'I could not take the soul of the mother. Her husband was\nkilled by a tree; the woman has twins, and prays that her soul may not\nbe taken. She says: "Let me nurse and feed my children, and set them on\ntheir feet. Children cannot live without father or mother." I have not\ntaken her soul.\' And God said: \'Go-take the mother\'s soul, and learn\nthree truths: Learn What dwells in man, What is not given to man, and\nWhat men live by. When thou has learnt these things, thou shalt return\nto heaven.\' So I flew again to earth and took the mother\'s soul. The\nbabes dropped from her breasts. Her body rolled over on the bed and\ncrushed one babe, twisting its leg. I rose above the village, wishing\nto take her soul to God; but a wind seized me, and my wings drooped and\ndropped off. Her soul rose alone to God, while I fell to earth by the\nroadside."\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\nAnd Simon and Matryona understood who it was that had lived with them,\nand whom they had clothed and fed. And they wept with awe and with joy.\nAnd the angel said: "I was alone in the field, naked. I had never known\nhuman needs, cold and hunger, till I became a man. I was famished,\nfrozen, and did not know what to do. I saw, near the field I was in, a\nshrine built for God, and I went to it hoping to find shelter. But\nthe shrine was locked, and I could not enter. So I sat down behind the\nshrine to shelter myself at least from the wind. Evening drew on. I was\nhungry, frozen, and in pain. Suddenly I heard a man coming along the\nroad. He carried a pair of boots, and was talking to himself. For the\nfirst time since I became a man I saw the mortal face of a man, and his\nface seemed terrible to me and I turned from it. And I heard the man\ntalking to himself of how to cover his body from the cold in winter, and\nhow to feed wife and children. And I thought: \'I am perishing of cold\nand hunger, and here is a man thinking only of how to clothe himself and\nhis wife, and how to get bread for themselves. He cannot help me.\' When\nthe man saw me he frowned and became still more terrible, and passed me\nby on the other side. I despaired; but suddenly I heard him coming back.\nI looked up, and did not recognize the same man; before, I had seen\ndeath in his face; but now he was alive, and I recognized in him the\npresence of God. He came up to me, clothed me, took me with him, and\nbrought me to his home. I entered the house; a woman came to meet us and\nbegan to speak. The woman was still more terrible than the man had been;\nthe spirit of death came from her mouth; I could not breathe for the\nstench of death that spread around her. She wished to drive me out into\nthe cold, and I knew that if she did so she would die. Suddenly her\nhusband spoke to her of God, and the woman changed at once. And when she\nbrought me food and looked at me, I glanced at her and saw that death no\nlonger dwelt in her; she had become alive, and in her, too, I saw God.\n\n"Then I remembered the first lesson God had set me: \'Learn what dwells\nin man.\' And I understood that in man dwells Love! I was glad that God\nhad already begun to show me what He had promised, and I smiled for the\nfirst time. But I had not yet learnt all. I did not yet know What is not\ngiven to man, and What men live by.\n\n"I lived with you, and a year passed. A man came to order boots that\nshould wear for a year without losing shape or cracking. I looked at\nhim, and suddenly, behind his shoulder, I saw my comrade--the angel of\ndeath. None but me saw that angel; but I knew him, and knew that before\nthe sun set he would take that rich man\'s soul. And I thought to myself,\n\'The man is making preparations for a year, and does not know that he\nwill die before evening.\' And I remembered God\'s second saying, \'Learn\nwhat is not given to man.\'\n\n"What dwells in man I already knew. Now I learnt what is not given\nhim. It is not given to man to know his own needs. And I smiled for the\nsecond time. I was glad to have seen my comrade angel--glad also that\nGod had revealed to me the second saying.\n\n"But I still did not know all. I did not know What men live by. And I\nlived on, waiting till God should reveal to me the last lesson. In the\nsixth year came the girl-twins with the woman; and I recognized the\ngirls, and heard how they had been kept alive. Having heard the story,\nI thought, \'Their mother besought me for the children\'s sake, and I\nbelieved her when she said that children cannot live without father or\nmother; but a stranger has nursed them, and has brought them up.\' And\nwhen the woman showed her love for the children that were not her own,\nand wept over them, I saw in her the living God and understood What men\nlive by. And I knew that God had revealed to me the last lesson, and had\nforgiven my sin. And then I smiled for the third time."\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\nAnd the angel\'s body was bared, and he was clothed in light so that eye\ncould not look on him; and his voice grew louder, as though it came not\nfrom him but from heaven above. And the angel said:\n\n"I have learnt that all men live not by care for themselves but by love.\n\n"It was not given to the mother to know what her children needed for\ntheir life. Nor was it given to the rich man to know what he himself\nneeded. Nor is it given to any man to know whether, when evening comes,\nhe will need boots for his body or slippers for his corpse.\n\n"I remained alive when I was a man, not by care of myself, but because\nlove was present in a passer-by, and because he and his wife pitied and\nloved me. The orphans remained alive not because of their mother\'s care,\nbut because there was love in the heart of a woman, a stranger to them,\nwho pitied and loved them. And all men live not by the thought they\nspend on their own welfare, but because love exists in man.\n\n"I knew before that God gave life to men and desires that they should\nlive; now I understood more than that.\n\n"I understood that God does not wish men to live apart, and therefore he\ndoes not reveal to them what each one needs for himself; but he wishes\nthem to live united, and therefore reveals to each of them what is\nnecessary for all.\n\n"I have now understood that though it seems to men that they live by\ncare for themselves, in truth it is love alone by which they live. He\nwho has love, is in God, and God is in him, for God is love."\n\nAnd the angel sang praise to God, so that the hut trembled at his voice.\nThe roof opened, and a column of fire rose from earth to heaven. Simon\nand his wife and children fell to the ground. Wings appeared upon the\nangel\'s shoulders, and he rose into the heavens.\n\nAnd when Simon came to himself the hut stood as before, and there was no\none in it but his own family.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHREE QUESTIONS\n\n\nIt once occurred to a certain king, that if he always knew the right\ntime to begin everything; if he knew who were the right people to listen\nto, and whom to avoid; and, above all, if he always knew what was the\nmost important thing to do, he would never fail in anything he might\nundertake.\n\nAnd this thought having occurred to him, he had it proclaimed throughout\nhis kingdom that he would give a great reward to any one who would teach\nhim what was the right time for every action, and who were the most\nnecessary people, and how he might know what was the most important\nthing to do.\n\nAnd learned men came to the King, but they all answered his questions\ndifferently.\n\nIn reply to the first question, some said that to know the right time\nfor every action, one must draw up in advance, a table of days, months\nand years, and must live strictly according to it. Only thus, said they,\ncould everything be done at its proper time. Others declared that it\nwas impossible to decide beforehand the right time for every action;\nbut that, not letting oneself be absorbed in idle pastimes, one should\nalways attend to all that was going on, and then do what was most\nneedful. Others, again, said that however attentive the King might be to\nwhat was going on, it was impossible for one man to decide correctly the\nright time for every action, but that he should have a Council of wise\nmen, who would help him to fix the proper time for everything.\n\nBut then again others said there were some things which could not wait\nto be laid before a Council, but about which one had at once to decide\nwhether to undertake them or not. But in order to decide that, one must\nknow beforehand what was going to happen. It is only magicians who know\nthat; and, therefore, in order to know the right time for every action,\none must consult magicians.\n\nEqually various were the answers to the second question. Some said, the\npeople the King most needed were his councillors; others, the priests;\nothers, the doctors; while some said the warriors were the most\nnecessary.\n\nTo the third question, as to what was the most important occupation:\nsome replied that the most important thing in the world was science.\nOthers said it was skill in warfare; and others, again, that it was\nreligious worship.\n\nAll the answers being different, the King agreed with none of them, and\ngave the reward to none. But still wishing to find the right answers to\nhis questions, he decided to consult a hermit, widely renowned for his\nwisdom.\n\nThe hermit lived in a wood which he never quitted, and he received none\nbut common folk. So the King put on simple clothes, and before reaching\nthe hermit\'s cell dismounted from his horse, and, leaving his body-guard\nbehind, went on alone.\n\nWhen the King approached, the hermit was digging the ground in front of\nhis hut. Seeing the King, he greeted him and went on digging. The hermit\nwas frail and weak, and each time he stuck his spade into the ground and\nturned a little earth, he breathed heavily.\n\nThe King went up to him and said: "I have come to you, wise hermit, to\nask you to answer three questions: How can I learn to do the right thing\nat the right time? Who are the people I most need, and to whom should\nI, therefore, pay more attention than to the rest? And, what affairs are\nthe most important, and need my first attention?"\n\nThe hermit listened to the King, but answered nothing. He just spat on\nhis hand and recommenced digging.\n\n"You are tired," said the King, "let me take the spade and work awhile\nfor you."\n\n"Thanks!" said the hermit, and, giving the spade to the King, he sat\ndown on the ground.\n\nWhen he had dug two beds, the King stopped and repeated his questions.\nThe hermit again gave no answer, but rose, stretched out his hand for\nthe spade, and said:\n\n"Now rest awhile-and let me work a bit."\n\nBut the King did not give him the spade, and continued to dig. One hour\npassed, and another. The sun began to sink behind the trees, and the\nKing at last stuck the spade into the ground, and said:\n\n"I came to you, wise man, for an answer to my questions. If you can give\nme none, tell me so, and I will return home."\n\n"Here comes some one running," said the hermit, "let us see who it is."\n\nThe King turned round, and saw a bearded man come running out of the\nwood. The man held his hands pressed against his stomach, and blood was\nflowing from under them. When he reached the King, he fell fainting on\nthe ground moaning feebly. The King and the hermit unfastened the man\'s\nclothing. There was a large wound in his stomach. The King washed it as\nbest he could, and bandaged it with his handkerchief and with a towel\nthe hermit had. But the blood would not stop flowing, and the King again\nand again removed the bandage soaked with warm blood, and washed and\nrebandaged the wound. When at last the blood ceased flowing, the man\nrevived and asked for something to drink. The King brought fresh water\nand gave it to him. Meanwhile the sun had set, and it had become cool.\nSo the King, with the hermit\'s help, carried the wounded man into the\nhut and laid him on the bed. Lying on the bed the man closed his eyes\nand was quiet; but the King was so tired with his walk and with the\nwork he had done, that he crouched down on the threshold, and also fell\nasleep--so soundly that he slept all through the short summer night.\nWhen he awoke in the morning, it was long before he could remember where\nhe was, or who was the strange bearded man lying on the bed and gazing\nintently at him with shining eyes.\n\n"Forgive me!" said the bearded man in a weak voice, when he saw that the\nKing was awake and was looking at him.\n\n"I do not know you, and have nothing to forgive you for," said the King.\n\n"You do not know me, but I know you. I am that enemy of yours who swore\nto revenge himself on you, because you executed his brother and seized\nhis property. I knew you had gone alone to see the hermit, and I\nresolved to kill you on your way back. But the day passed and you did\nnot return. So I came out from my ambush to find you, and I came upon\nyour bodyguard, and they recognized me, and wounded me. I escaped from\nthem, but should have bled to death had you not dressed my wound. I\nwished to kill you, and you have saved my life. Now, if I live, and if\nyou wish it, I will serve you as your most faithful slave, and will bid\nmy sons do the same. Forgive me!"\n\nThe King was very glad to have made peace with his enemy so easily, and\nto have gained him for a friend, and he not only forgave him, but said\nhe would send his servants and his own physician to attend him, and\npromised to restore his property.\n\nHaving taken leave of the wounded man, the King went out into the porch\nand looked around for the hermit. Before going away he wished once more\nto beg an answer to the questions he had put. The hermit was outside, on\nhis knees, sowing seeds in the beds that had been dug the day before.\n\nThe King approached him, and said:\n\n"For the last time, I pray you to answer my questions, wise man."\n\n"You have already been answered!" said the hermit, still crouching on\nhis thin legs, and looking up at the King, who stood before him.\n\n"How answered? What do you mean?" asked the King.\n\n"Do you not see," replied the hermit. "If you had not pitied my weakness\nyesterday, and had not dug those beds for me, but had gone your way,\nthat man would have attacked you, and you would have repented of not\nhaving stayed with me. So the most important time was when you were\ndigging the beds; and I was the most important man; and to do me good\nwas your most important business. Afterwards when that man ran to us,\nthe most important time was when you were attending to him, for if you\nhad not bound up his wounds he would have died without having made peace\nwith you. So he was the most important man, and what you did for him was\nyour most important business. Remember then: there is only one time that\nis important--Now! It is the most important time because it is the only\ntime when we have any power. The most necessary man is he with whom you\nare, for no man knows whether he will ever have dealings with any one\nelse: and the most important affair is, to do him good, because for that\npurpose alone was man sent into this life!"\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE COFFEE-HOUSE OF SURAT\n\n(After Bernardin de Saint-Pierre)\n\n\nIn the town of Surat, in India, was a coffee-house where many travellers\nand foreigners from all parts of the world met and conversed.\n\nOne day a learned Persian theologian visited this coffee-house. He was a\nman who had spent his life studying the nature of the Deity, and reading\nand writing books upon the subject. He had thought, read, and written so\nmuch about God, that eventually he lost his wits, became quite confused,\nand ceased even to believe in the existence of a God. The Shah, hearing\nof this, had banished him from Persia.\n\nAfter having argued all his life about the First Cause, this unfortunate\ntheologian had ended by quite perplexing himself, and instead of\nunderstanding that he had lost his own reason, he began to think that\nthere was no higher Reason controlling the universe.\n\nThis man had an African slave who followed him everywhere. When the\ntheologian entered the coffee-house, the slave remained outside, near\nthe door, sitting on a stone in the glare of the sun, and driving away\nthe flies that buzzed around him. The Persian having settled down on a\ndivan in the coffee-house, ordered himself a cup of opium. When he had\ndrunk it and the opium had begun to quicken the workings of his brain,\nhe addressed his slave through the open door:\n\n"Tell me, wretched slave," said he, "do you think there is a God, or\nnot?"\n\n"Of course there is," said the slave, and immediately drew from under\nhis girdle a small idol of wood.\n\n"There," said he, "that is the God who has guarded me from the day of my\nbirth. Every one in our country worships the fetish tree, from the wood\nof which this God was made."\n\nThis conversation between the theologian and his slave was listened\nto with surprise by the other guests in the coffee-house. They were\nastonished at the master\'s question, and yet more so at the slave\'s\nreply.\n\nOne of them, a Brahmin, on hearing the words spoken by the slave, turned\nto him and said:\n\n"Miserable fool! Is it possible you believe that God can be carried\nunder a man\'s girdle? There is one God--Brahma, and he is greater than\nthe whole world, for he created it. Brahma is the One, the mighty God,\nand in His honour are built the temples on the Ganges\' banks, where his\ntrue priests, the Brahmins, worship him. They know the true God, and\nnone but they. A thousand score of years have passed, and yet through\nrevolution after revolution these priests have held their sway, because\nBrahma, the one true God, has protected them."\n\nSo spoke the Brahmin, thinking to convince every one; but a Jewish\nbroker who was present replied to him, and said:\n\n"No! the temple of the true God is not in India. Neither does God\nprotect the Brahmin caste. The true God is not the God of the Brahmins,\nbut of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. None does He protect but His chosen\npeople, the Israelites. From the commencement of the world, our nation\nhas been beloved of Him, and ours alone. If we are now scattered over\nthe whole earth, it is but to try us; for God has promised that He will\none day gather His people together in Jerusalem. Then, with the Temple\nof Jerusalem--the wonder of the ancient world--restored to its splendor,\nshall Israel be established a ruler over all nations."\n\nSo spoke the Jew, and burst into tears. He wished to say more, but an\nItalian missionary who was there interrupted him.\n\n"What you are saying is untrue," said he to the Jew. "You attribute\ninjustice to God. He cannot love your nation above the rest. Nay rather,\neven if it be true that of old He favored the Israelites, it is now\nnineteen hundred years since they angered Him, and caused Him to destroy\ntheir nation and scatter them over the earth, so that their faith makes\nno converts and has died out except here and there. God shows preference\nto no nation, but calls all who wish to be saved to the bosom of the\nCatholic Church of Rome, the one outside whose borders no salvation can\nbe found."\n\nSo spoke the Italian. But a Protestant minister, who happened to be\npresent, growing pale, turned to the Catholic missionary and exclaimed:\n\n"How can you say that salvation belongs to your religion? Those only\nwill be saved, who serve God according to the Gospel, in spirit and in\ntruth, as bidden by the word of Christ."\n\nThen a Turk, an office-holder in the custom-house at Surat, who was\nsitting in the coffee-house smoking a pipe, turned with an air of\nsuperiority to both the Christians.\n\n"Your belief in your Roman religion is vain," said he. "It was\nsuperseded twelve hundred years ago by the true faith: that of Mohammed!\nYou cannot but observe how the true Mohammed faith continues to spread\nboth in Europe and Asia, and even in the enlightened country of China.\nYou say yourselves that God has rejected the Jews; and, as a proof, you\nquote the fact that the Jews are humiliated and their faith does not\nspread. Confess then the truth of Mohammedanism, for it is triumphant\nand spreads far and wide. None will be saved but the followers of\nMohammed, God\'s latest prophet; and of them, only the followers of Omar,\nand not of Ali, for the latter are false to the faith."\n\nTo this the Persian theologian, who was of the sect of Ali, wished\nto reply; but by this time a great dispute had arisen among all the\nstrangers of different faiths and creeds present. There were Abyssinian\nChristians, Llamas from Thibet, Ismailians and Fireworshippers. They all\nargued about the nature of God, and how He should be worshipped. Each\nof them asserted that in his country alone was the true God known and\nrightly worshipped.\n\nEvery one argued and shouted, except a Chinaman, a student of Confucius,\nwho sat quietly in one corner of the coffee-house, not joining in the\ndispute. He sat there drinking tea and listening to what the others\nsaid, but did not speak himself.\n\nThe Turk noticed him sitting there, and appealed to him, saying:\n\n"You can confirm what I say, my good Chinaman. You hold your peace,\nbut if you spoke I know you would uphold my opinion. Traders from\nyour country, who come to me for assistance, tell me that though\nmany religions have been introduced into China, you Chinese consider\nMohammedanism the best of all, and adopt it willingly. Confirm, then, my\nwords, and tell us your opinion of the true God and of His prophet."\n\n"Yes, yes," said the rest, turning to the Chinaman, "let us hear what\nyou think on the subject."\n\nThe Chinaman, the student of Confucius, closed his eyes, and thought a\nwhile. Then he opened them again, and drawing his hands out of the wide\nsleeves of his garment, and folding them on his breast, he spoke as\nfollows, in a calm and quiet voice.\n\nSirs, it seems to me that it is chiefly pride that prevents men agreeing\nwith one another on matters of faith. If you care to listen to me, I\nwill tell you a story which will explain this by an example.\n\nI came here from China on an English steamer which had been round the\nworld. We stopped for fresh water, and landed on the east coast of the\nisland of Sumatra. It was midday, and some of us, having landed, sat in\nthe shade of some cocoanut palms by the seashore, not far from a native\nvillage. We were a party of men of different nationalities.\n\nAs we sat there, a blind man approached us. We learned afterwards that\nhe had gone blind from gazing too long and too persistently at the sun,\ntrying to find out what it is, in order to seize its light.\n\nHe strove a long time to accomplish this, constantly looking at the sun;\nbut the only result was that his eyes were injured by its brightness,\nand he became blind.\n\nThen he said to himself:\n\n"The light of the sun is not a liquid; for if it were a liquid it would\nbe possible to pour it from one vessel into another, and it would be\nmoved, like water, by the wind. Neither is it fire; for if it were fire,\nwater would extinguish it. Neither is light a spirit, for it is seen\nby the eye; nor is it matter, for it cannot be moved. Therefore, as the\nlight of the sun is neither liquid, nor fire, nor spirit, nor matter, it\nis--nothing!"\n\nSo he argued, and, as a result of always looking at the sun and always\nthinking about it, he lost both his sight and his reason. And when he\nwent quite blind, he became fully convinced that the sun did not exist.\n\nWith this blind man came a slave, who after placing his master in the\nshade of a cocoanut tree, picked up a cocoanut from the ground, and\nbegan making it into a night-light. He twisted a wick from the fibre\nof the cocoanut: squeezed oil from the nut in the shell, and soaked the\nwick in it.\n\nAs the slave sat doing this, the blind man sighed and said to him:\n\n"Well, slave, was I not right when I told you there is no sun? Do you\nnot see how dark it is? Yet people say there is a sun.... But if so,\nwhat is it?"\n\n"I do not know what the sun is," said the slave. "That is no business of\nmine. But I know what light is. Here I have made a night-light, by the\nhelp of which I can serve you and find anything I want in the hut."\n\nAnd the slave picked up the cocoanut shell, saying:\n\n"This is my sun."\n\nA lame man with crutches, who was sitting near by, heard these words,\nand laughed:\n\n"You have evidently been blind all your life," said he to the blind man,\n"not to know what the sun is. I will tell you what it is. The sun is\na ball of fire, which rises every morning out of the sea and goes down\nagain among the mountains of our island each evening. We have all seen\nthis, and if you had had your eyesight you too would have seen it."\n\nA fisherman, who had been listening to the conversation said:\n\n"It is plain enough that you have never been beyond your own island. If\nyou were not lame, and if you had been out as I have in a fishing-boat,\nyou would know that the sun does not set among the mountains of our\nisland, but as it rises from the ocean every morning so it sets again in\nthe sea every night. What I am telling you is true, for I see it every\nday with my own eyes."\n\nThen an Indian who was of our party, interrupted him by saying:\n\n"I am astonished that a reasonable man should talk such nonsense.\nHow can a ball of fire possibly descend into the water and not be\nextinguished? The sun is not a ball of fire at all, it is the Deity\nnamed Deva, who rides for ever in a chariot round the golden mountain,\nMeru. Sometimes the evil serpents Ragu and Ketu attack Deva and swallow\nhim: and then the earth is dark. But our priests pray that the Deity may\nbe released, and then he is set free. Only such ignorant men as you, who\nhave never been beyond their own island, can imagine that the sun shines\nfor their country alone."\n\nThen the master of an Egyptian vessel, who was present, spoke in his\nturn.\n\n"No," said he, "you also are wrong. The sun is not a Deity, and does not\nmove only round India and its golden mountain. I have sailed much on the\nBlack Sea, and along the coasts of Arabia, and have been to Madagascar\nand to the Philippines. The sun lights the whole earth, and not India\nalone. It does not circle round one mountain, but rises far in the East,\nbeyond the Isles of Japan, and sets far, far away in the West, beyond\nthe islands of England. That is why the Japanese call their country\n\'Nippon,\' that is, \'the birth of the sun.\' I know this well, for I have\nmyself seen much, and heard more from my grandfather, who sailed to the\nvery ends of the sea."\n\nHe would have gone on, but an English sailor from our ship interrupted\nhim.\n\n"There is no country," he said "where people know so much about the\nsun\'s movements as in England. The sun, as every one in England knows,\nrises nowhere and sets nowhere. It is always moving round the earth. We\ncan be sure of this for we have just been round the world ourselves,\nand nowhere knocked up against the sun. Wherever we went, the sun showed\nitself in the morning and hid itself at night, just as it does here."\n\nAnd the Englishman took a stick and, drawing circles on the sand, tried\nto explain how the sun moves in the heavens and goes round the world.\nBut he was unable to explain it clearly, and pointing to the ship\'s\npilot said:\n\n"This man knows more about it than I do. He can explain it properly."\n\nThe pilot, who was an intelligent man, had listened in silence to the\ntalk till he was asked to speak. Now every one turned to him, and he\nsaid:\n\n"You are all misleading one another, and are yourselves deceived. The\nsun does not go round the earth, but the earth goes round the sun,\nrevolving as it goes, and turning towards the sun in the course of each\ntwenty-four hours, not only Japan, and the Philippines, and Sumatra\nwhere we now are, but Africa, and Europe, and America, and many lands\nbesides. The sun does not shine for some one mountain, or for some one\nisland, or for some one sea, nor even for one earth alone, but for other\nplanets as well as our earth. If you would only look up at the heavens,\ninstead of at the ground beneath your own feet, you might all understand\nthis, and would then no longer suppose that the sun shines for you, or\nfor your country alone."\n\nThus spoke the wise pilot, who had voyaged much about the world, and had\ngazed much upon the heavens above.\n\n"So on matters of faith," continued the Chinaman, the student of\nConfucius, "it is pride that causes error and discord among men. As with\nthe sun, so it is with God. Each man wants to have a special God of his\nown, or at least a special God for his native land. Each nation wishes\nto confine in its own temples Him, whom the world cannot contain.\n\n"Can any temple compare with that which God Himself has built to unite\nall men in one faith and one religion?\n\n"All human temples are built on the model of this temple, which is God\'s\nown world. Every temple has its fonts, its vaulted roof, its lamps,\nits pictures or sculptures, its inscriptions, its books of the law, its\nofferings, its altars and its priests. But in what temple is there such\na font as the ocean; such a vault as that of the heavens; such lamps\nas the sun, moon, and stars; or any figures to be compared with living,\nloving, mutually-helpful men? Where are there any records of God\'s\ngoodness so easy to understand as the blessings which God has strewn\nabroad for man\'s happiness? Where is there any book of the law so clear\nto each man as that written in his heart? What sacrifices equal the\nself-denials which loving men and women make for one another? And what\naltar can be compared with the heart of a good man, on which God Himself\naccepts the sacrifice?\n\n"The higher a man\'s conception of God, the better will he know Him. And\nthe better he knows God, the nearer will he draw to Him, imitating His\ngoodness, His mercy, and His love of man.\n\n"Therefore, let him who sees the sun\'s whole light filling the world,\nrefrain from blaming or despising the superstitious man, who in his\nown idol sees one ray of that same light. Let him not despise even the\nunbeliever who is blind and cannot see the sun at all."\n\nSo spoke the Chinaman, the student of Confucius; and all who were\npresent in the coffee-house were silent, and disputed no more as to\nwhose faith was the best.\n\n\n\n\nHOW MUCH LAND DOES A MAN NEED?\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nAn elder sister came to visit her younger sister in the country. The\nelder was married to a tradesman in town, the younger to a peasant in\nthe village. As the sisters sat over their tea talking, the elder began\nto boast of the advantages of town life: saying how comfortably they\nlived there, how well they dressed, what fine clothes her children wore,\nwhat good things they ate and drank, and how she went to the theatre,\npromenades, and entertainments.\n\nThe younger sister was piqued, and in turn disparaged the life of a\ntradesman, and stood up for that of a peasant.\n\n"I would not change my way of life for yours," said she. "We may live\nroughly, but at least we are free from anxiety. You live in better style\nthan we do, but though you often earn more than you need, you are very\nlikely to lose all you have. You know the proverb, \'Loss and gain are\nbrothers twain.\' It often happens that people who are wealthy one day\nare begging their bread the next. Our way is safer. Though a peasant\'s\nlife is not a fat one, it is a long one. We shall never grow rich, but\nwe shall always have enough to eat."\n\nThe elder sister said sneeringly:\n\n"Enough? Yes, if you like to share with the pigs and the calves! What do\nyou know of elegance or manners! However much your good man may slave,\nyou will die as you are living-on a dung heap-and your children the\nsame."\n\n"Well, what of that?" replied the younger. "Of course our work is rough\nand coarse. But, on the other hand, it is sure; and we need not bow to\nany one. But you, in your towns, are surrounded by temptations; today\nall may be right, but tomorrow the Evil One may tempt your husband with\ncards, wine, or women, and all will go to ruin. Don\'t such things happen\noften enough?"\n\nPahom, the master of the house, was lying on the top of the oven, and he\nlistened to the women\'s chatter.\n\n"It is perfectly true," thought he. "Busy as we are from childhood\ntilling Mother Earth, we peasants have no time to let any nonsense\nsettle in our heads. Our only trouble is that we haven\'t land enough. If\nI had plenty of land, I shouldn\'t fear the Devil himself!"\n\nThe women finished their tea, chatted a while about dress, and then\ncleared away the tea-things and lay down to sleep.\n\nBut the Devil had been sitting behind the oven, and had heard all that\nwas said. He was pleased that the peasant\'s wife had led her husband\ninto boasting, and that he had said that if he had plenty of land he\nwould not fear the Devil himself.\n\n"All right," thought the Devil. "We will have a tussle. I\'ll give you\nland enough; and by means of that land I will get you into my power."\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nClose to the village there lived a lady, a small landowner, who had an\nestate of about three hundred acres. She had always lived on good terms\nwith the peasants, until she engaged as her steward an old soldier, who\ntook to burdening the people with fines. However careful Pahom tried to\nbe, it happened again and again that now a horse of his got among the\nlady\'s oats, now a cow strayed into her garden, now his calves found\ntheir way into her meadows-and he always had to pay a fine.\n\nPahom paid, but grumbled, and, going home in a temper, was rough with\nhis family. All through that summer Pahom had much trouble because of\nthis steward; and he was even glad when winter came and the cattle had\nto be stabled. Though he grudged the fodder when they could no longer\ngraze on the pasture-land, at least he was free from anxiety about them.\n\nIn the winter the news got about that the lady was going to sell her\nland, and that the keeper of the inn on the high road was bargaining for\nit. When the peasants heard this they were very much alarmed.\n\n"Well," thought they, "if the innkeeper gets the land he will worry us\nwith fines worse than the lady\'s steward. We all depend on that estate."\n\nSo the peasants went on behalf of their Commune, and asked the lady not\nto sell the land to the innkeeper; offering her a better price for it\nthemselves. The lady agreed to let them have it. Then the peasants tried\nto arrange for the Commune to buy the whole estate, so that it might\nbe held by all in common. They met twice to discuss it, but could not\nsettle the matter; the Evil One sowed discord among them, and they could\nnot agree. So they decided to buy the land individually, each according\nto his means; and the lady agreed to this plan as she had to the other.\n\nPresently Pahom heard that a neighbor of his was buying fifty acres,\nand that the lady had consented to accept one half in cash and to wait a\nyear for the other half. Pahom felt envious.\n\n"Look at that," thought he, "the land is all being sold, and I shall get\nnone of it." So he spoke to his wife.\n\n"Other people are buying," said he, "and we must also buy twenty acres\nor so. Life is becoming impossible. That steward is simply crushing us\nwith his fines."\n\nSo they put their heads together and considered how they could manage to\nbuy it. They had one hundred roubles laid by. They sold a colt, and one\nhalf of their bees; hired out one of their sons as a laborer, and took\nhis wages in advance; borrowed the rest from a brother-in-law, and so\nscraped together half the purchase money.\n\nHaving done this, Pahom chose out a farm of forty acres, some of\nit wooded, and went to the lady to bargain for it. They came to an\nagreement, and he shook hands with her upon it, and paid her a deposit\nin advance. Then they went to town and signed the deeds; he paying half\nthe price down, and undertaking to pay the remainder within two years.\n\nSo now Pahom had land of his own. He borrowed seed, and sowed it on the\nland he had bought. The harvest was a good one, and within a year he had\nmanaged to pay off his debts both to the lady and to his brother-in-law.\nSo he became a landowner, ploughing and sowing his own land, making hay\non his own land, cutting his own trees, and feeding his cattle on his\nown pasture. When he went out to plough his fields, or to look at his\ngrowing corn, or at his grass meadows, his heart would fill with joy.\nThe grass that grew and the flowers that bloomed there, seemed to him\nunlike any that grew elsewhere. Formerly, when he had passed by that\nland, it had appeared the same as any other land, but now it seemed\nquite different.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nSo Pahom was well contented, and everything would have been right if the\nneighboring peasants would only not have trespassed on his corn-fields\nand meadows. He appealed to them most civilly, but they still went on:\nnow the Communal herdsmen would let the village cows stray into his\nmeadows; then horses from the night pasture would get among his corn.\nPahom turned them out again and again, and forgave their owners, and\nfor a long time he forbore from prosecuting any one. But at last he\nlost patience and complained to the District Court. He knew it was the\npeasants\' want of land, and no evil intent on their part, that caused\nthe trouble; but he thought:\n\n"I cannot go on overlooking it, or they will destroy all I have. They\nmust be taught a lesson."\n\nSo he had them up, gave them one lesson, and then another, and two or\nthree of the peasants were fined. After a time Pahom\'s neighbours began\nto bear him a grudge for this, and would now and then let their cattle\non his land on purpose. One peasant even got into Pahom\'s wood at night\nand cut down five young lime trees for their bark. Pahom passing through\nthe wood one day noticed something white. He came nearer, and saw the\nstripped trunks lying on the ground, and close by stood the stumps,\nwhere the tree had been. Pahom was furious.\n\n"If he had only cut one here and there it would have been bad enough,"\nthought Pahom, "but the rascal has actually cut down a whole clump. If I\ncould only find out who did this, I would pay him out."\n\nHe racked his brains as to who it could be. Finally he decided: "It\nmust be Simon-no one else could have done it." Se he went to Simon\'s\nhomestead to have a look around, but he found nothing, and only had an\nangry scene. However\' he now felt more certain than ever that Simon had\ndone it, and he lodged a complaint. Simon was summoned. The case was\ntried, and re-tried, and at the end of it all Simon was acquitted, there\nbeing no evidence against him. Pahom felt still more aggrieved, and let\nhis anger loose upon the Elder and the Judges.\n\n"You let thieves grease your palms," said he. "If you were honest folk\nyourselves, you would not let a thief go free."\n\nSo Pahom quarrelled with the Judges and with his neighbors. Threats to\nburn his building began to be uttered. So though Pahom had more land,\nhis place in the Commune was much worse than before.\n\nAbout this time a rumor got about that many people were moving to new\nparts.\n\n"There\'s no need for me to leave my land," thought Pahom. "But some of\nthe others might leave our village, and then there would be more room\nfor us. I would take over their land myself, and make my estate a bit\nbigger. I could then live more at ease. As it is, I am still too cramped\nto be comfortable."\n\nOne day Pahom was sitting at home, when a peasant passing through the\nvillage, happened to call in. He was allowed to stay the night, and\nsupper was given him. Pahom had a talk with this peasant and asked him\nwhere he came from. The stranger answered that he came from beyond the\nVolga, where he had been working. One word led to another, and the man\nwent on to say that many people were settling in those parts. He told\nhow some people from his village had settled there. They had joined the\nCommune, and had had twenty-five acres per man granted them. The land\nwas so good, he said, that the rye sown on it grew as high as a horse,\nand so thick that five cuts of a sickle made a sheaf. One peasant, he\nsaid, had brought nothing with him but his bare hands, and now he had\nsix horses and two cows of his own.\n\nPahom\'s heart kindled with desire. He thought:\n\n"Why should I suffer in this narrow hole, if one can live so well\nelsewhere? I will sell my land and my homestead here, and with the money\nI will start afresh over there and get everything new. In this crowded\nplace one is always having trouble. But I must first go and find out all\nabout it myself."\n\nTowards summer he got ready and started. He went down the Volga on a\nsteamer to Samara, then walked another three hundred miles on foot, and\nat last reached the place. It was just as the stranger had said. The\npeasants had plenty of land: every man had twenty-five acres of Communal\nland given him for his use, and any one who had money could buy,\nbesides, at fifty-cents an acre as much good freehold land as he wanted.\n\nHaving found out all he wished to know, Pahom returned home as autumn\ncame on, and began selling off his belongings. He sold his land at\na profit, sold his homestead and all his cattle, and withdrew from\nmembership of the Commune. He only waited till the spring, and then\nstarted with his family for the new settlement.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nAs soon as Pahom and his family arrived at their new abode, he applied\nfor admission into the Commune of a large village. He stood treat to the\nElders, and obtained the necessary documents. Five shares of Communal\nland were given him for his own and his sons\' use: that is to say--125\nacres (not altogether, but in different fields) besides the use of\nthe Communal pasture. Pahom put up the buildings he needed, and bought\ncattle. Of the Communal land alone he had three times as much as at his\nformer home, and the land was good corn-land. He was ten times better\noff than he had been. He had plenty of arable land and pasturage, and\ncould keep as many head of cattle as he liked.\n\nAt first, in the bustle of building and settling down, Pahom was pleased\nwith it all, but when he got used to it he began to think that even here\nhe had not enough land. The first year, he sowed wheat on his share of\nthe Communal land, and had a good crop. He wanted to go on sowing\nwheat, but had not enough Communal land for the purpose, and what he had\nalready used was not available; for in those parts wheat is only sown on\nvirgin soil or on fallow land. It is sown for one or two years, and\nthen the land lies fallow till it is again overgrown with prairie grass.\nThere were many who wanted such land, and there was not enough for all;\nso that people quarrelled about it. Those who were better off, wanted it\nfor growing wheat, and those who were poor, wanted it to let to dealers,\nso that they might raise money to pay their taxes. Pahom wanted to sow\nmore wheat; so he rented land from a dealer for a year. He sowed\nmuch wheat and had a fine crop, but the land was too far from the\nvillage--the wheat had to be carted more than ten miles. After a time\nPahom noticed that some peasant-dealers were living on separate farms,\nand were growing wealthy; and he thought:\n\n"If I were to buy some freehold land, and have a homestead on it, it\nwould be a different thing, altogether. Then it would all be nice and\ncompact."\n\nThe question of buying freehold land recurred to him again and again.\n\nHe went on in the same way for three years; renting land and sowing\nwheat. The seasons turned out well and the crops were good, so that he\nbegan to lay money by. He might have gone on living contentedly, but he\ngrew tired of having to rent other people\'s land every year, and having\nto scramble for it. Wherever there was good land to be had, the peasants\nwould rush for it and it was taken up at once, so that unless you were\nsharp about it you got none. It happened in the third year that he and\na dealer together rented a piece of pasture land from some peasants; and\nthey had already ploughed it up, when there was some dispute, and the\npeasants went to law about it, and things fell out so that the labor\nwas all lost. "If it were my own land," thought Pahom, "I should be\nindependent, and there would not be all this unpleasantness."\n\nSo Pahom began looking out for land which he could buy; and he came\nacross a peasant who had bought thirteen hundred acres, but having got\ninto difficulties was willing to sell again cheap. Pahom bargained and\nhaggled with him, and at last they settled the price at 1,500 roubles,\npart in cash and part to be paid later. They had all but clinched the\nmatter, when a passing dealer happened to stop at Pahom\'s one day to get\na feed for his horse. He drank tea with Pahom, and they had a talk. The\ndealer said that he was just returning from the land of the Bashkirs,\nfar away, where he had bought thirteen thousand acres of land all for\n1,000 roubles. Pahom questioned him further, and the tradesman said:\n\n"All one need do is to make friends with the chiefs. I gave away about\none hundred roubles\' worth of dressing-gowns and carpets, besides a case\nof tea, and I gave wine to those who would drink it; and I got the land\nfor less than two cents an acre. And he showed Pahom the title-deeds,\nsaying:\n\n"The land lies near a river, and the whole prairie is virgin soil."\n\nPahom plied him with questions, and the tradesman said:\n\n"There is more land there than you could cover if you walked a year, and\nit all belongs to the Bashkirs. They are as simple as sheep, and land\ncan be got almost for nothing."\n\n"There now," thought Pahom, "with my one thousand roubles, why should I\nget only thirteen hundred acres, and saddle myself with a debt besides.\nIf I take it out there, I can get more than ten times as much for the\nmoney."\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nPahom inquired how to get to the place, and as soon as the tradesman\nhad left him, he prepared to go there himself. He left his wife to look\nafter the homestead, and started on his journey taking his man with\nhim. They stopped at a town on their way, and bought a case of tea, some\nwine, and other presents, as the tradesman had advised. On and on they\nwent until they had gone more than three hundred miles, and on the\nseventh day they came to a place where the Bashkirs had pitched their\ntents. It was all just as the tradesman had said. The people lived on\nthe steppes, by a river, in felt-covered tents. They neither tilled the\nground, nor ate bread. Their cattle and horses grazed in herds on the\nsteppe. The colts were tethered behind the tents, and the mares were\ndriven to them twice a day. The mares were milked, and from the milk\nkumiss was made. It was the women who prepared kumiss, and they also\nmade cheese. As far as the men were concerned, drinking kumiss and tea,\neating mutton, and playing on their pipes, was all they cared about.\nThey were all stout and merry, and all the summer long they never\nthought of doing any work. They were quite ignorant, and knew no\nRussian, but were good-natured enough.\n\nAs soon as they saw Pahom, they came out of their tents and gathered\nround their visitor. An interpreter was found, and Pahom told them he\nhad come about some land. The Bashkirs seemed very glad; they took Pahom\nand led him into one of the best tents, where they made him sit on some\ndown cushions placed on a carpet, while they sat round him. They gave\nhim tea and kumiss, and had a sheep killed, and gave him mutton to\neat. Pahom took presents out of his cart and distributed them among the\nBashkirs, and divided amongst them the tea. The Bashkirs were delighted.\nThey talked a great deal among themselves, and then told the interpreter\nto translate.\n\n"They wish to tell you," said the interpreter, "that they like you, and\nthat it is our custom to do all we can to please a guest and to repay\nhim for his gifts. You have given us presents, now tell us which of the\nthings we possess please you best, that we may present them to you."\n\n"What pleases me best here," answered Pahom, "is your land. Our land is\ncrowded, and the soil is exhausted; but you have plenty of land and it\nis good land. I never saw the like of it."\n\nThe interpreter translated. The Bashkirs talked among themselves for a\nwhile. Pahom could not understand what they were saying, but saw that\nthey were much amused, and that they shouted and laughed. Then they were\nsilent and looked at Pahom while the interpreter said:\n\n"They wish me to tell you that in return for your presents they will\ngladly give you as much land as you want. You have only to point it out\nwith your hand and it is yours."\n\nThe Bashkirs talked again for a while and began to dispute. Pahom asked\nwhat they were disputing about, and the interpreter told him that some\nof them thought they ought to ask their Chief about the land and not act\nin his absence, while others thought there was no need to wait for his\nreturn.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nWhile the Bashkirs were disputing, a man in a large fox-fur cap appeared\non the scene. They all became silent and rose to their feet. The\ninterpreter said, "This is our Chief himself."\n\nPahom immediately fetched the best dressing-gown and five pounds of\ntea, and offered these to the Chief. The Chief accepted them, and seated\nhimself in the place of honour. The Bashkirs at once began telling him\nsomething. The Chief listened for a while, then made a sign with his\nhead for them to be silent, and addressing himself to Pahom, said in\nRussian:\n\n"Well, let it be so. Choose whatever piece of land you like; we have\nplenty of it."\n\n"How can I take as much as I like?" thought Pahom. "I must get a deed to\nmake it secure, or else they may say, \'It is yours,\' and afterwards may\ntake it away again."\n\n"Thank you for your kind words," he said aloud. "You have much land, and\nI only want a little. But I should like to be sure which bit is mine.\nCould it not be measured and made over to me? Life and death are in\nGod\'s hands. You good people give it to me, but your children might wish\nto take it away again."\n\n"You are quite right," said the Chief. "We will make it over to you."\n\n"I heard that a dealer had been here," continued Pahom, "and that you\ngave him a little land, too, and signed title-deeds to that effect. I\nshould like to have it done in the same way."\n\nThe Chief understood.\n\n"Yes," replied he, "that can be done quite easily. We have a scribe, and\nwe will go to town with you and have the deed properly sealed."\n\n"And what will be the price?" asked Pahom.\n\n"Our price is always the same: one thousand roubles a day."\n\nPahom did not understand.\n\n"A day? What measure is that? How many acres would that be?"\n\n"We do not know how to reckon it out," said the Chief. "We sell it by\nthe day. As much as you can go round on your feet in a day is yours, and\nthe price is one thousand roubles a day."\n\nPahom was surprised.\n\n"But in a day you can get round a large tract of land," he said.\n\nThe Chief laughed.\n\n"It will all be yours!" said he. "But there is one condition: If you\ndon\'t return on the same day to the spot whence you started, your money\nis lost."\n\n"But how am I to mark the way that I have gone?"\n\n"Why, we shall go to any spot you like, and stay there. You must start\nfrom that spot and make your round, taking a spade with you. Wherever\nyou think necessary, make a mark. At every turning, dig a hole and pile\nup the turf; then afterwards we will go round with a plough from hole to\nhole. You may make as large a circuit as you please, but before the sun\nsets you must return to the place you started from. All the land you\ncover will be yours."\n\nPahom was delighted. It-was decided to start early next morning. They\ntalked a while, and after drinking some more kumiss and eating some more\nmutton, they had tea again, and then the night came on. They gave Pahom\na feather-bed to sleep on, and the Bashkirs dispersed for the night,\npromising to assemble the next morning at daybreak and ride out before\nsunrise to the appointed spot.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nPahom lay on the feather-bed, but could not sleep. He kept thinking\nabout the land.\n\n"What a large tract I will mark off!" thought he. "I can easily go\nthirty-five miles in a day. The days are long now, and within a circuit\nof thirty-five miles what a lot of land there will be! I will sell the\npoorer land, or let it to peasants, but I\'ll pick out the best and farm\nit. I will buy two ox-teams, and hire two more laborers. About a hundred\nand fifty acres shall be plough-land, and I will pasture cattle on the\nrest."\n\nPahom lay awake all night, and dozed off only just before dawn. Hardly\nwere his eyes closed when he had a dream. He thought he was lying in\nthat same tent, and heard somebody chuckling outside. He wondered who it\ncould be, and rose and went out, and he saw the Bashkir Chief sitting\nin front of the tent holding his side and rolling about with laughter.\nGoing nearer to the Chief, Pahom asked: "What are you laughing at?" But\nhe saw that it was no longer the Chief, but the dealer who had recently\nstopped at his house and had told him about the land. Just as Pahom\nwas going to ask, "Have you been here long?" he saw that it was not the\ndealer, but the peasant who had come up from the Volga, long ago, to\nPahom\'s old home. Then he saw that it was not the peasant either, but\nthe Devil himself with hoofs and horns, sitting there and chuckling,\nand before him lay a man barefoot, prostrate on the ground, with\nonly trousers and a shirt on. And Pahom dreamt that he looked more\nattentively to see what sort of a man it was lying there, and he saw\nthat the man was dead, and that it was himself! He awoke horror-struck.\n\n"What things one does dream," thought he.\n\nLooking round he saw through the open door that the dawn was breaking.\n\n"It\'s time to wake them up," thought he. "We ought to be starting."\n\nHe got up, roused his man (who was sleeping in his cart), bade him\nharness; and went to call the Bashkirs.\n\n"It\'s time to go to the steppe to measure the land," he said.\n\nThe Bashkirs rose and assembled, and the Chief came, too. Then they\nbegan drinking kumiss again, and offered Pahom some tea, but he would\nnot wait.\n\n"If we are to go, let us go. It is high time," said he.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nThe Bashkirs got ready and they all started: some mounted on horses, and\nsome in carts. Pahom drove in his own small cart with his servant, and\ntook a spade with him. When they reached the steppe, the morning red was\nbeginning to kindle. They ascended a hillock (called by the Bashkirs a\nshikhan) and dismounting from their carts and their horses, gathered in\none spot. The Chief came up to Pahom and stretched out his arm towards\nthe plain:\n\n"See," said he, "all this, as far as your eye can reach, is ours. You\nmay have any part of it you like."\n\nPahom\'s eyes glistened: it was all virgin soil, as flat as the palm of\nyour hand, as black as the seed of a poppy, and in the hollows different\nkinds of grasses grew breast high.\n\nThe Chief took off his fox-fur cap, placed it on the ground and said:\n\n"This will be the mark. Start from here, and return here again. All the\nland you go round shall be yours."\n\nPahom took out his money and put it on the cap. Then he took off his\nouter coat, remaining in his sleeveless under coat. He unfastened his\ngirdle and tied it tight below his stomach, put a little bag of bread\ninto the breast of his coat, and tying a flask of water to his girdle,\nhe drew up the tops of his boots, took the spade from his man, and stood\nready to start. He considered for some moments which way he had better\ngo--it was tempting everywhere.\n\n"No matter," he concluded, "I will go towards the rising sun."\n\nHe turned his face to the east, stretched himself, and waited for the\nsun to appear above the rim.\n\n"I must lose no time," he thought, "and it is easier walking while it is\nstill cool."\n\nThe sun\'s rays had hardly flashed above the horizon, before Pahom,\ncarrying the spade over his shoulder, went down into the steppe.\n\nPahom started walking neither slowly nor quickly. After having gone a\nthousand yards he stopped, dug a hole and placed pieces of turf one on\nanother to make it more visible. Then he went on; and now that he had\nwalked off his stiffness he quickened his pace. After a while he dug\nanother hole.\n\nPahom looked back. The hillock could be distinctly seen in the sunlight,\nwith the people on it, and the glittering tires of the cartwheels. At\na rough guess Pahom concluded that he had walked three miles. It\nwas growing warmer; he took off his under-coat, flung it across his\nshoulder, and went on again. It had grown quite warm now; he looked at\nthe sun, it was time to think of breakfast.\n\n"The first shift is done, but there are four in a day, and it is\ntoo soon yet to turn. But I will just take off my boots," said he to\nhimself.\n\nHe sat down, took off his boots, stuck them into his girdle, and went\non. It was easy walking now.\n\n"I will go on for another three miles," thought he, "and then turn to\nthe left. The spot is so fine, that it would be a pity to lose it. The\nfurther one goes, the better the land seems."\n\nHe went straight on a for a while, and when he looked round, the hillock\nwas scarcely visible and the people on it looked like black ants, and he\ncould just see something glistening there in the sun.\n\n"Ah," thought Pahom, "I have gone far enough in this direction, it is\ntime to turn. Besides I am in a regular sweat, and very thirsty."\n\nHe stopped, dug a large hole, and heaped up pieces of turf. Next he\nuntied his flask, had a drink, and then turned sharply to the left. He\nwent on and on; the grass was high, and it was very hot.\n\nPahom began to grow tired: he looked at the sun and saw that it was\nnoon.\n\n"Well," he thought, "I must have a rest."\n\nHe sat down, and ate some bread and drank some water; but he did not\nlie down, thinking that if he did he might fall asleep. After sitting a\nlittle while, he went on again. At first he walked easily: the food had\nstrengthened him; but it had become terribly hot, and he felt sleepy;\nstill he went on, thinking: "An hour to suffer, a life-time to live."\n\nHe went a long way in this direction also, and was about to turn to\nthe left again, when he perceived a damp hollow: "It would be a pity to\nleave that out," he thought. "Flax would do well there." So he went on\npast the hollow, and dug a hole on the other side of it before he turned\nthe corner. Pahom looked towards the hillock. The heat made the air\nhazy: it seemed to be quivering, and through the haze the people on the\nhillock could scarcely be seen.\n\n"Ah!" thought Pahom, "I have made the sides too long; I must make this\none shorter." And he went along the third side, stepping faster. He\nlooked at the sun: it was nearly half way to the horizon, and he had\nnot yet done two miles of the third side of the square. He was still ten\nmiles from the goal.\n\n"No," he thought, "though it will make my land lopsided, I must hurry\nback in a straight line now. I might go too far, and as it is I have a\ngreat deal of land."\n\nSo Pahom hurriedly dug a hole, and turned straight towards the hillock.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\nPahom went straight towards the hillock, but he now walked with\ndifficulty. He was done up with the heat, his bare feet were cut and\nbruised, and his legs began to fail. He longed to rest, but it was\nimpossible if he meant to get back before sunset. The sun waits for no\nman, and it was sinking lower and lower.\n\n"Oh dear," he thought, "if only I have not blundered trying for too\nmuch! What if I am too late?"\n\nHe looked towards the hillock and at the sun. He was still far from his\ngoal, and the sun was already near the rim. Pahom walked on and on; it\nwas very hard walking, but he went quicker and quicker. He pressed on,\nbut was still far from the place. He began running, threw away his coat,\nhis boots, his flask, and his cap, and kept only the spade which he used\nas a support.\n\n"What shall I do," he thought again, "I have grasped too much, and\nruined the whole affair. I can\'t get there before the sun sets."\n\nAnd this fear made him still more breathless. Pahom went on running, his\nsoaking shirt and trousers stuck to him, and his mouth was parched. His\nbreast was working like a blacksmith\'s bellows, his heart was beating\nlike a hammer, and his legs were giving way as if they did not belong to\nhim. Pahom was seized with terror lest he should die of the strain.\n\nThough afraid of death, he could not stop. "After having run all that\nway they will call me a fool if I stop now," thought he. And he ran on\nand on, and drew near and heard the Bashkirs yelling and shouting to\nhim, and their cries inflamed his heart still more. He gathered his last\nstrength and ran on.\n\nThe sun was close to the rim, and cloaked in mist looked large, and red\nas blood. Now, yes now, it was about to set! The sun was quite low, but\nhe was also quite near his aim. Pahom could already see the people on\nthe hillock waving their arms to hurry him up. He could see the fox-fur\ncap on the ground, and the money on it, and the Chief sitting on the\nground holding his sides. And Pahom remembered his dream.\n\n"There is plenty of land," thought he, "but will God let me live on\nit? I have lost my life, I have lost my life! I shall never reach that\nspot!"\n\nPahom looked at the sun, which had reached the earth: one side of it\nhad already disappeared. With all his remaining strength he rushed\non, bending his body forward so that his legs could hardly follow fast\nenough to keep him from falling. Just as he reached the hillock it\nsuddenly grew dark. He looked up--the sun had already set. He gave a\ncry: "All my labor has been in vain," thought he, and was about to stop,\nbut he heard the Bashkirs still shouting, and remembered that though to\nhim, from below, the sun seemed to have set, they on the hillock could\nstill see it. He took a long breath and ran up the hillock. It was still\nlight there. He reached the top and saw the cap. Before it sat the Chief\nlaughing and holding his sides. Again Pahom remembered his dream, and\nhe uttered a cry: his legs gave way beneath him, he fell forward and\nreached the cap with his hands.\n\n"Ah, what a fine fellow!" exclaimed the Chief. "He has gained much\nland!"\n\nPahom\'s servant came running up and tried to raise him, but he saw that\nblood was flowing from his mouth. Pahom was dead!\n\nThe Bashkirs clicked their tongues to show their pity.\n\nHis servant picked up the spade and dug a grave long enough for Pahom\nto lie in, and buried him in it. Six feet from his head to his heels was\nall he needed.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n1. One hundred kopeks make a rouble. The kopek is worth about half a\ncent.\n\n2. A non-intoxicating drink usually made from rye-malt and rye-flour.\n\n3. The brick oven in a Russian peasant\'s hut is usually built so as to\nleave a flat top, large enough to lie on, for those who want to sleep in\na warm place.\n\n4. 120 "desyatins." The "desyatina" is properly 2.7 acres; but in this\nstory round numbers are used.\n\n5. Three roubles per "desyatina."\n\n6. Five "kopeks" for a "desyatina."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'b'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT MEN LIVE BY AND OTHER TALES\n\nBy Leo Tolstoy\n\n\n\n\n     "We know that we have passed out of death into life, because\n     we love the brethren.

Work was cheap, but bread was dear, and what he\nearned he spent for food. The man and his wife had but one sheepskin\ncoat between them for winter wear, and even that was torn to tatters,\nand this was the second year he had been wanting to buy sheep-skins for\na new coat. Before winter Simon saved up a little money: a three-rouble\nnote lay hidden in his wife\'s box, and five roubles and twenty kopeks\nwere owed him by customers in the village.\n\nSo one morning he prepared to go to the village to buy the sheep-skins.\nHe put on over his shirt his wife\'s wadded nankeen jacket, and over that\nhe put his own cloth coat. He took the three-rouble note in his\npocket, cut himself a stick to serve as a staff, and started off after\nbreakfast. "I\'ll collect the five roubles that are due to me,"\nthought he, "add the three I have got, and that will be enough to buy\nsheep-skins for the winter coat."\n\nHe came to the village and called at a peasant\'s hut, but the man was\nnot at home. The peasant\'s wife promised that the money should be\npaid next week, but she would not pay it herself. Then Simon called on\nanother peasant, but this one swore he had no money, and would only pay\ntwenty kopeks which he owed for a pair of boots Simon had mended. Simon\nthen tried to buy the sheep-skins on credit, but the dealer would not\ntrust him.\n\n"Bring your money," said he, "then you may have your pick of the skins.\nWe know what debt-collecting is like." So all the business the shoemaker\ndid was to get the twenty kopeks for boots he had mended, and to take a\npair of felt boots a peasant gave him to sole with leather.\n\nSimon felt downhearted. He spent the twenty kopeks on vodka, and started\nhomewards without having bought any skins. In the morning he had felt\nthe frost; but now, after drinking the vodka, he felt warm, even without\na sheep-skin coat. He trudged along, striking his stick on the frozen\nearth with one hand, swinging the felt boots with the other, and talking\nto himself.\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n"I\'m quite warm," said he, "though I have no sheep-skin coat. I\'ve had\na drop, and it runs through all my veins. I need no sheep-skins. I go\nalong and don\'t worry about anything. That\'s the sort of man I am! What\ndo I care? I can live without sheep-skins. I don\'t need them. My wife\nwill fret, to be sure. And, true enough, it is a shame; one works all\nday long, and then does not get paid. Stop a bit! If you don\'t bring\nthat money along, sure enough I\'ll skin you, blessed if I don\'t. How\'s\nthat? He pays twenty kopeks at a time! What can I do with twenty kopeks?\nDrink it-that\'s all one can do! Hard up, he says he is! So he may\nbe--but what about me? You have a house, and cattle, and everything;\nI\'ve only what I stand up in! You have corn of your own growing; I have\nto buy every grain. Do what I will, I must spend three roubles every\nweek for bread alone. I come home and find the bread all used up, and I\nhave to fork out another rouble and a half. So just pay up what you owe,\nand no nonsense about it!"\n\nBy this time he had nearly reached the shrine at the bend of the road.\nLooking up, he saw something whitish behind the shrine. The daylight was\nfading, and the shoemaker peered at the thing without being able to make\nout what it was. "There was no white stone here before. Can it be an ox?\nIt\'s not like an ox. It has a head like a man, but it\'s too white; and\nwhat could a man be doing there?"\n\nHe came closer, so that it was clearly visible. To his surprise it\nreally was a man, alive or dead, sitting naked, leaning motionless\nagainst the shrine. Terror seized the shoemaker, and he thought, "Some\none has killed him, stripped him, and left him there. If I meddle I\nshall surely get into trouble."\n\nSo the shoemaker went on. He passed in front of the shrine so that he\ncould not see the man. When he had gone some way, he looked back, and\nsaw that the man was no longer leaning against the shrine, but was\nmoving as if looking towards him. The shoemaker felt more frightened\nthan before, and thought, "Shall I go back to him, or shall I go on? If\nI go near him something dreadful may happen. Who knows who the fellow\nis? He has not come here for any good. If I go near him he may jump\nup and throttle me, and there will be no getting away. Or if not, he\'d\nstill be a burden on one\'s hands. What could I do with a naked man? I\ncouldn\'t give him my last clothes. Heaven only help me to get away!"\n\nSo the shoemaker hurried on, leaving the shrine behind him-when suddenly\nhis conscience smote him, and he stopped in the road.\n\n"What are you doing, Simon?" said he to himself. "The man may be dying\nof want, and you slip past afraid. Have you grown so rich as to be\nafraid of robbers? Ah, Simon, shame on you!"\n\nSo he turned back and went up to the man.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nSimon approached the stranger, looked at him, and saw that he was a\nyoung man, fit, with no bruises on his body, only evidently freezing and\nfrightened, and he sat there leaning back without looking up at Simon,\nas if too faint to lift his eyes. Simon went close to him, and then the\nman seemed to wake up. Turning his head, he opened his eyes and looked\ninto Simon\'s face. That one look was enough to make Simon fond of the\nman. He threw the felt boots on the ground, undid his sash, laid it on\nthe boots, and took off his cloth coat.\n\n"It\'s not a time for talking," said he. "Come, put this coat on at\nonce!" And Simon took the man by the elbows and helped him to rise. As\nhe stood there, Simon saw that his body was clean and in good condition,\nhis hands and feet shapely, and his face good and kind. He threw\nhis coat over the man\'s shoulders, but the latter could not find the\nsleeves. Simon guided his arms into them, and drawing the coat well on,\nwrapped it closely about him, tying the sash round the man\'s waist.\n\nSimon even took off his torn cap to put it on the man\'s head, but then\nhis own head felt cold, and he thought: "I\'m quite bald, while he has\nlong curly hair." So he put his cap on his own head again. "It will be\nbetter to give him something for his feet," thought he; and he made the\nman sit down, and helped him to put on the felt boots, saying, "There,\nfriend, now move about and warm yourself. Other matters can be settled\nlater on. Can you walk?"\n\nThe man stood up and looked kindly at Simon, but could not say a word.\n\n"Why don\'t you speak?" said Simon. "It\'s too cold to stay here, we must\nbe getting home. There now, take my stick, and if you\'re feeling weak,\nlean on that. Now step out!"\n\nThe man started walking, and moved easily, not lagging behind.\n\nAs they went along, Simon asked him, "And where do you belong to?" "I\'m\nnot from these parts."\n\n"I thought as much. I know the folks hereabouts. But, how did you come\nto be there by the shrine?"\n\n"I cannot tell."\n\n"Has some one been ill-treating you?"\n\n"No one has ill-treated me. God has punished me."\n\n"Of course God rules all. Still, you\'ll have to find food and shelter\nsomewhere. Where do you want to go to?"\n\n"It is all the same to me."\n\nSimon was amazed. The man did not look like a rogue, and he spoke\ngently, but yet he gave no account of himself. Still Simon thought, "Who\nknows what may have happened?" And he said to the stranger: "Well then,\ncome home with me, and at least warm yourself awhile."\n\nSo Simon walked towards his home, and the stranger kept up with him,\nwalking at his side. The wind had risen and Simon felt it cold under his\nshirt. He was getting over his tipsiness by now, and began to feel the\nfrost. He went along sniffling and wrapping his wife\'s coat round him,\nand he thought to himself: "There now--talk about sheep-skins! I went\nout for sheep-skins and come home without even a coat to my back, and\nwhat is more, I\'m bringing a naked man along with me. Matryona won\'t\nbe pleased!" And when he thought of his wife he felt sad; but when he\nlooked at the stranger and remembered how he had looked up at him at the\nshrine, his heart was glad.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nSimon\'s wife had everything ready early that day. She had cut wood,\nbrought water, fed the children, eaten her own meal, and now she sat\nthinking. She wondered when she ought to make bread: now or tomorrow?\nThere was still a large piece left.\n\n"If Simon has had some dinner in town," thought she, "and does not eat\nmuch for supper, the bread will last out another day."\n\nShe weighed the piece of bread in her hand again and again, and thought:\n"I won\'t make any more today. We have only enough flour left to bake one\nbatch; We can manage to make this last out till Friday."\n\nSo Matryona put away the bread, and sat down at the table to patch her\nhusband\'s shirt. While she worked she thought how her husband was buying\nskins for a winter coat.\n\n"If only the dealer does not cheat him. My good man is much too simple;\nhe cheats nobody, but any child can take him in. Eight roubles is a lot\nof money--he should get a good coat at that price. Not tanned skins, but\nstill a proper winter coat. How difficult it was last winter to get on\nwithout a warm coat. I could neither get down to the river, nor go out\nanywhere. When he went out he put on all we had, and there was nothing\nleft for me. He did not start very early today, but still it\'s time he\nwas back. I only hope he has not gone on the spree!"\n\nHardly had Matryona thought this, when steps were heard on the\nthreshold, and some one entered. Matryona stuck her needle into her work\nand went out into the passage. There she saw two men: Simon, and with\nhim a man without a hat, and wearing felt boots.\n\nMatryona noticed at once that her husband smelt of spirits. "There\nnow, he has been drinking," thought she. And when she saw that he was\ncoatless, had only her jacket on, brought no parcel, stood there silent,\nand seemed ashamed, her heart was ready to break with disappointment.\n"He has drunk the money," thought she, "and has been on the spree with\nsome good-for-nothing fellow whom he has brought home with him."\n\nMatryona let them pass into the hut, followed them in, and saw that the\nstranger was a young, slight man, wearing her husband\'s coat. There\nwas no shirt to be seen under it, and he had no hat. Having entered, he\nstood, neither moving, nor raising his eyes, and Matryona thought: "He\nmust be a bad man--he\'s afraid."\n\nMatryona frowned, and stood beside the oven looking to see what they\nwould do.\n\nSimon took off his cap and sat down on the bench as if things were all\nright.\n\n"Come, Matryona; if supper is ready, let us have some."\n\nMatryona muttered something to herself and did not move, but stayed\nwhere she was, by the oven. She looked first at the one and then at\nthe other of them, and only shook her head. Simon saw that his wife was\nannoyed, but tried to pass it off. Pretending not to notice anything, he\ntook the stranger by the arm.\n\n"Sit down, friend," said he, "and let us have some supper."\n\nThe stranger sat down on the bench.\n\n"Haven\'t you cooked anything for us?" said Simon.\n\nMatryona\'s anger boiled over. "I\'ve cooked, but not for you. It seems to\nme you have drunk your wits away. You went to buy a sheep-skin coat,\nbut come home without so much as the coat you had on, and bring a naked\nvagabond home with you. I have no supper for drunkards like you."\n\n"That\'s enough, Matryona. Don\'t wag your tongue without reason. You had\nbetter ask what sort of man--"\n\n"And you tell me what you\'ve done with the money?"\n\nSimon found the pocket of the jacket, drew out the three-rouble note,\nand unfolded it.\n\n"Here is the money. Trifonof did not pay, but promises to pay soon."\n\nMatryona got still more angry; he had bought no sheep-skins, but had\nput his only coat on some naked fellow and had even brought him to their\nhouse.\n\nShe snatched up the note from the table, took it to put away in safety,\nand said: "I have no supper for you. We can\'t feed all the naked\ndrunkards in the world."\n\n"There now, Matryona, hold your tongue a bit. First hear what a man has\nto say-"\n\n"Much wisdom I shall hear from a drunken fool. I was right in not\nwanting to marry you-a drunkard. The linen my mother gave me you drank;\nand now you\'ve been to buy a coat-and have drunk it, too!"\n\nSimon tried to explain to his wife that he had only spent twenty kopeks;\ntried to tell how he had found the man--but Matryona would not let him\nget a word in. She talked nineteen to the dozen, and dragged in things\nthat had happened ten years before.\n\nMatryona talked and talked, and at last she flew at Simon and seized him\nby the sleeve.\n\n"Give me my jacket. It is the only one I have, and you must needs take\nit from me and wear it yourself. Give it here, you mangy dog, and may\nthe devil take you."\n\nSimon began to pull off the jacket, and turned a sleeve of it inside\nout; Matryona seized the jacket and it burst its seams, She snatched it\nup, threw it over her head and went to the door. She meant to go out,\nbut stopped undecided--she wanted to work off her anger, but she also\nwanted to learn what sort of a man the stranger was.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nMatryona stopped and said: "If he were a good man he would not be naked.\nWhy, he hasn\'t even a shirt on him. If he were all right, you would say\nwhere you came across the fellow."\n\n"That\'s just what I am trying to tell you," said Simon. "As I came to\nthe shrine I saw him sitting all naked and frozen. It isn\'t quite\nthe weather to sit about naked! God sent me to him, or he would have\nperished. What was I to do? How do we know what may have happened to\nhim? So I took him, clothed him, and brought him along. Don\'t be so\nangry, Matryona. It is a sin. Remember, we all must die one day."\n\nAngry words rose to Matryona\'s lips, but she looked at the stranger\nand was silent. He sat on the edge of the bench, motionless, his hands\nfolded on his knees, his head drooping on his breast, his eyes closed,\nand his brows knit as if in pain. Matryona was silent: and Simon said:\n"Matryona, have you no love of God?"\n\nMatryona heard these words, and as she looked at the stranger, suddenly\nher heart softened towards him. She came back from the door, and going\nto the oven she got out the supper. Setting a cup on the table, she\npoured out some kvas. Then she brought out the last piece of bread, and\nset out a knife and spoons.\n\n"Eat, if you want to," said she.\n\nSimon drew the stranger to the table.\n\n"Take your place, young man," said he.\n\nSimon cut the bread, crumbled it into the broth, and they began to eat.\nMatryona sat at the corner of the table resting her head on her hand and\nlooking at the stranger.\n\nAnd Matryona was touched with pity for the stranger, and began to feel\nfond of him. And at once the stranger\'s face lit up; his brows were no\nlonger bent, he raised his eyes and smiled at Matryona.\n\nWhen they had finished supper, the woman cleared away the things and\nbegan questioning the stranger. "Where are you from?" said she.\n\n"I am not from these parts."\n\n"But how did you come to be on the road?"\n\n"I may not tell."\n\n"Did some one rob you?"\n\n"God punished me."\n\n"And you were lying there naked?"\n\n"Yes, naked and freezing. Simon saw me and had pity on me. He took off\nhis coat, put it on me and brought me here. And you have fed me, given\nme drink, and shown pity on me. God will reward you!"\n\nMatryona rose, took from the window Simon\'s old shirt she had been\npatching, and gave it to the stranger. She also brought out a pair of\ntrousers for him.\n\n"There," said she, "I see you have no shirt. Put this on, and lie down\nwhere you please, in the loft or on the oven."\n\nThe stranger took off the coat, put on the shirt, and lay down in the\nloft. Matryona put out the candle, took the coat, and climbed to where\nher husband lay.\n\nMatryona drew the skirts of the coat over her and lay down, but could\nnot sleep; she could not get the stranger out of her mind.\n\nWhen she remembered that he had eaten their last piece of bread and that\nthere was none for tomorrow, and thought of the shirt and trousers she\nhad given away, she felt grieved; but when she remembered how he had\nsmiled, her heart was glad.\n\nLong did Matryona lie awake, and she noticed that Simon also was\nawake--he drew the coat towards him.\n\n"Simon!"\n\n"Well?"\n\n"You have had the last of the bread, and I have not put any to rise.\nI don\'t know what we shall do tomorrow. Perhaps I can borrow some of\nneighbor Martha."\n\n"If we\'re alive we shall find something to eat."\n\nThe woman lay still awhile, and then said, "He seems a good man, but why\ndoes he not tell us who he is?"\n\n"I suppose he has his reasons."\n\n"Simon!"\n\n"Well?"\n\n"We give; but why does nobody give us anything?"\n\nSimon did not know what to say; so he only said, "Let us stop talking,"\nand turned over and went to sleep.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nIn the morning Simon awoke. The children were still asleep; his wife\nhad gone to the neighbor\'s to borrow some bread. The stranger alone was\nsitting on the bench, dressed in the old shirt and trousers, and looking\nupwards. His face was brighter than it had been the day before.\n\nSimon said to him, "Well, friend; the belly wants bread, and the naked\nbody clothes. One has to work for a living What work do you know?"\n\n"I do not know any."\n\nThis surprised Simon, but he said, "Men who want to learn can learn\nanything."\n\n"Men work, and I will work also."\n\n"What is your name?"\n\n"Michael."\n\n"Well, Michael, if you don\'t wish to talk about yourself, that is your\nown affair; but you\'ll have to earn a living for yourself. If you will\nwork as I tell you, I will give you food and shelter."\n\n"May God reward you! I will learn. Show me what to do."\n\nSimon took yarn, put it round his thumb and began to twist it.\n\n"It is easy enough--see!"\n\nMichael watched him, put some yarn round his own thumb in the same way,\ncaught the knack, and twisted the yarn also.\n\nThen Simon showed him how to wax the thread. This also Michael mastered.\nNext Simon showed him how to twist the bristle in, and how to sew, and\nthis, too, Michael learned at once.\n\nWhatever Simon showed him he understood at once, and after three days he\nworked as if he had sewn boots all his life. He worked without stopping,\nand ate little. When work was over he sat silently, looking upwards.\nHe hardly went into the street, spoke only when necessary, and neither\njoked nor laughed. They never saw him smile, except that first evening\nwhen Matryona gave them supper.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nDay by day and week by week the year went round. Michael lived and\nworked with Simon. His fame spread till people said that no one sewed\nboots so neatly and strongly as Simon\'s workman, Michael; and from all\nthe district round people came to Simon for their boots, and he began to\nbe well off.\n\nOne winter day, as Simon and Michael sat working, a carriage on\nsledge-runners, with three horses and with bells, drove up to the hut.\nThey looked out of the window; the carriage stopped at their door, a\nfine servant jumped down from the box and opened the door. A gentleman\nin a fur coat got out and walked up to Simon\'s hut. Up jumped Matryona\nand opened the door wide. The gentleman stooped to enter the hut, and\nwhen he drew himself up again his head nearly reached the ceiling, and\nhe seemed quite to fill his end of the room.\n\nSimon rose, bowed, and looked at the gentleman with astonishment. He had\nnever seen any one like him. Simon himself was lean, Michael was thin,\nand Matryona was dry as a bone, but this man was like some one from\nanother world: red-faced, burly, with a neck like a bull\'s, and looking\naltogether as if he were cast in iron.\n\nThe gentleman puffed, threw off his fur coat, sat down on the bench, and\nsaid, "Which of you is the master bootmaker?"\n\n"I am, your Excellency," said Simon, coming forward.\n\nThen the gentleman shouted to his lad, "Hey, Fedka, bring the leather!"\n\nThe servant ran in, bringing a parcel. The gentleman took the parcel and\nput it on the table.\n\n"Untie it," said he. The lad untied it.\n\nThe gentleman pointed to the leather.\n\n"Look here, shoemaker," said he, "do you see this leather?"\n\n"Yes, your honor."\n\n"But do you know what sort of leather it is?"\n\nSimon felt the leather and said, "It is good leather."\n\n"Good, indeed! Why, you fool, you never saw such leather before in your\nlife. It\'s German, and cost twenty roubles."\n\nSimon was frightened, and said, "Where should I ever see leather like\nthat?"\n\n"Just so! Now, can you make it into boots for me?"\n\n"Yes, your Excellency, I can."\n\nThen the gentleman shouted at him: "You can, can you? Well, remember\nwhom you are to make them for, and what the leather is. You must make me\nboots that will wear for a year, neither losing shape nor coming unsown.\nIf you can do it, take the leather and cut it up; but if you can\'t, say\nso. I warn you now if your boots become unsewn or lose shape within a\nyear, I will have you put in prison. If they don\'t burst or lose shape\nfor a year I will pay you ten roubles for your work."\n\nSimon was frightened, and did not know what to say. He glanced at\nMichael and nudging him with his elbow, whispered: "Shall I take the\nwork?"\n\nMichael nodded his head as if to say, "Yes, take it."\n\nSimon did as Michael advised, and undertook to make boots that would not\nlose shape or split for a whole year.\n\nCalling his servant, the gentleman told him to pull the boot off his\nleft leg, which he stretched out.\n\n"Take my measure!" said he.\n\nSimon stitched a paper measure seventeen inches long, smoothed it out,\nknelt down, wiped his hand well on his apron so as not to soil the\ngentleman\'s sock, and began to measure. He measured the sole, and round\nthe instep, and began to measure the calf of the leg, but the paper was\ntoo short. The calf of the leg was as thick as a beam.\n\n"Mind you don\'t make it too tight in the leg."\n\nSimon stitched on another strip of paper. The gentleman twitched his\ntoes about in his sock, looking round at those in the hut, and as he did\nso he noticed Michael.\n\n"Whom have you there?" asked he.\n\n"That is my workman. He will sew the boots."\n\n"Mind," said the gentleman to Michael, "remember to make them so that\nthey will last me a year."\n\nSimon also looked at Michael, and saw that Michael was not looking at\nthe gentleman, but was gazing into the corner behind the gentleman, as\nif he saw some one there. Michael looked and looked, and suddenly he\nsmiled, and his face became brighter.\n\n"What are you grinning at, you fool?" thundered the gentleman. "You had\nbetter look to it that the boots are ready in time."\n\n"They shall be ready in good time," said Michael.\n\n"Mind it is so," said the gentleman, and he put on his boots and his fur\ncoat, wrapped the latter round him, and went to the door. But he forgot\nto stoop, and struck his head against the lintel.\n\nHe swore and rubbed his head. Then he took his seat in the carriage and\ndrove away.\n\nWhen he had gone, Simon said: "There\'s a figure of a man for you! You\ncould not kill him with a mallet. He almost knocked out the lintel, but\nlittle harm it did him."\n\nAnd Matryona said: "Living as he does, how should he not grow strong?\nDeath itself can\'t touch such a rock as that."\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nThen Simon said to Michael: "Well, we have taken the work, but we must\nsee we don\'t get into trouble over it. The leather is dear, and the\ngentleman hot-tempered. We must make no mistakes. Come, your eye is\ntruer and your hands have become nimbler than mine, so you take this\nmeasure and cut out the boots. I will finish off the sewing of the\nvamps."\n\nMichael did as he was told. He took the leather, spread it out on the\ntable, folded it in two, took a knife and began to cut out.\n\nMatryona came and watched him cutting, and was surprised to see how\nhe was doing it. Matryona was accustomed to seeing boots made, and she\nlooked and saw that Michael was not cutting the leather for boots, but\nwas cutting it round.\n\nShe wished to say something, but she thought to herself: "Perhaps I do\nnot understand how gentleman\'s boots should be made. I suppose Michael\nknows more about it--and I won\'t interfere."\n\nWhen Michael had cut up the leather, he took a thread and began to sew\nnot with two ends, as boots are sewn, but with a single end, as for soft\nslippers.\n\nAgain Matryona wondered, but again she did not interfere. Michael sewed\non steadily till noon. Then Simon rose for dinner, looked around, and\nsaw that Michael had made slippers out of the gentleman\'s leather.\n\n"Ah," groaned Simon, and he thought, "How is it that Michael, who has\nbeen with me a whole year and never made a mistake before, should do\nsuch a dreadful thing? The gentleman ordered high boots, welted, with\nwhole fronts, and Michael has made soft slippers with single soles, and\nhas wasted the leather. What am I to say to the gentleman? I can never\nreplace leather such as this."\n\nAnd he said to Michael, "What are you doing, friend? You have ruined me!\nYou know the gentleman ordered high boots, but see what you have made!"\n\nHardly had he begun to rebuke Michael, when "rat-tat" went the iron ring\nthat hung at the door. Some one was knocking. They looked out of the\nwindow; a man had come on horseback, and was fastening his horse. They\nopened the door, and the servant who had been with the gentleman came\nin.\n\n"Good day," said he.\n\n"Good day," replied Simon. "What can we do for you?"\n\n"My mistress has sent me about the boots."\n\n"What about the boots?"\n\n"Why, my master no longer needs them. He is dead."\n\n"Is it possible?"\n\n"He did not live to get home after leaving you, but died in the\ncarriage. When we reached home and the servants came to help him alight,\nhe rolled over like a sack. He was dead already, and so stiff that\nhe could hardly be got out of the carriage. My mistress sent me here,\nsaying: \'Tell the bootmaker that the gentleman who ordered boots of him\nand left the leather for them no longer needs the boots, but that he\nmust quickly make soft slippers for the corpse. Wait till they are\nready, and bring them back with you.\' That is why I have come."\n\nMichael gathered up the remnants of the leather; rolled them up, took\nthe soft slippers he had made, slapped them together, wiped them down\nwith his apron, and handed them and the roll of leather to the servant,\nwho took them and said: "Good-bye, masters, and good day to you!"\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nAnother year passed, and another, and Michael was now living his sixth\nyear with Simon. He lived as before. He went nowhere, only spoke when\nnecessary, and had only smiled twice in all those years--once when\nMatryona gave him food, and a second time when the gentleman was in\ntheir hut. Simon was more than pleased with his workman. He never now\nasked him where he came from, and only feared lest Michael should go\naway.\n\nThey were all at home one day. Matryona was putting iron pots in the\noven; the children were running along the benches and looking out of the\nwindow; Simon was sewing at one window, and Michael was fastening on a\nheel at the other.\n\nOne of the boys ran along the bench to Michael, leant on his shoulder,\nand looked out of the window.\n\n"Look, Uncle Michael! There is a lady with little girls! She seems to be\ncoming here. And one of the girls is lame."\n\nWhen the boy said that, Michael dropped his work, turned to the window,\nand looked out into the street.\n\nSimon was surprised. Michael never used to look out into the street,\nbut now he pressed against the window, staring at something. Simon also\nlooked out, and saw that a well-dressed woman was really coming to\nhis hut, leading by the hand two little girls in fur coats and woolen\nshawls. The girls could hardly be told one from the other, except that\none of them was crippled in her left leg and walked with a limp.\n\nThe woman stepped into the porch and entered the passage. Feeling about\nfor the entrance she found the latch, which she lifted, and opened the\ndoor. She let the two girls go in first, and followed them into the hut.\n\n"Good day, good folk!"\n\n"Pray come in," said Simon. "What can we do for you?"\n\nThe woman sat down by the table. The two little girls pressed close to\nher knees, afraid of the people in the hut.\n\n"I want leather shoes made for these two little girls for spring."\n\n"We can do that. We never have made such small shoes, but we can make\nthem; either welted or turnover shoes, linen lined. My man, Michael, is\na master at the work."\n\nSimon glanced at Michael and saw that he had left his work and was\nsitting with his eyes fixed on the little girls. Simon was surprised.\nIt was true the girls were pretty, with black eyes, plump, and\nrosy-cheeked, and they wore nice kerchiefs and fur coats, but still\nSimon could not understand why Michael should look at them like\nthat--just as if he had known them before. He was puzzled, but went on\ntalking with the woman, and arranging the price. Having fixed it, he\nprepared the measure. The woman lifted the lame girl on to her lap and\nsaid: "Take two measures from this little girl. Make one shoe for the\nlame foot and three for the sound one. They both have the same size\nfeet. They are twins."\n\nSimon took the measure and, speaking of the lame girl, said: "How did it\nhappen to her? She is such a pretty girl. Was she born so?"\n\n"No, her mother crushed her leg."\n\nThen Matryona joined in. She wondered who this woman was, and whose the\nchildren were, so she said: "Are not you their mother then?"\n\n"No, my good woman; I am neither their mother nor any relation to them.\nThey were quite strangers to me, but I adopted them."\n\n"They are not your children and yet you are so fond of them?"\n\n"How can I help being fond of them? I fed them both at my own breasts.\nI had a child of my own, but God took him. I was not so fond of him as I\nnow am of them."\n\n"Then whose children are they?"\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\nThe woman, having begun talking, told them the whole story.\n\n"It is about six years since their parents died, both in one week: their\nfather was buried on the Tuesday, and their mother died on the Friday.\nThese orphans were born three days after their father\'s death, and their\nmother did not live another day. My husband and I were then living as\npeasants in the village. We were neighbors of theirs, our yard being\nnext to theirs. Their father was a lonely man; a wood-cutter in the\nforest. When felling trees one day, they let one fall on him. It fell\nacross his body and crushed his bowels out. They hardly got him home\nbefore his soul went to God; and that same week his wife gave birth to\ntwins--these little girls. She was poor and alone; she had no one,\nyoung or old, with her. Alone she gave them birth, and alone she met her\ndeath."\n\n"The next morning I went to see her, but when I entered the hut, she,\npoor thing, was already stark and cold. In dying she had rolled on to\nthis child and crushed her leg. The village folk came to the hut, washed\nthe body, laid her out, made a coffin, and buried her. They were good\nfolk. The babies were left alone. What was to be done with them? I\nwas the only woman there who had a baby at the time. I was nursing my\nfirst-born--eight weeks old. So I took them for a time. The peasants\ncame together, and thought and thought what to do with them; and at last\nthey said to me: \'For the present, Mary, you had better keep the girls,\nand later on we will arrange what to do for them.\' So I nursed the sound\none at my breast, but at first I did not feed this crippled one. I did\nnot suppose she would live. But then I thought to myself, why should the\npoor innocent suffer? I pitied her, and began to feed her. And so I fed\nmy own boy and these two--the three of them--at my own breast. I was\nyoung and strong, and had good food, and God gave me so much milk that\nat times it even overflowed. I used sometimes to feed two at a time,\nwhile the third was waiting. When one had enough I nursed the third. And\nGod so ordered it that these grew up, while my own was buried before he\nwas two years old. And I had no more children, though we prospered.\nNow my husband is working for the corn merchant at the mill. The pay\nis good, and we are well off. But I have no children of my own, and how\nlonely I should be without these little girls! How can I help loving\nthem! They are the joy of my life!"\n\nShe pressed the lame little girl to her with one hand, while with the\nother she wiped the tears from her cheeks.\n\nAnd Matryona sighed, and said: "The proverb is true that says, \'One may\nlive without father or mother, but one cannot live without God.\'"\n\nSo they talked together, when suddenly the whole hut was lighted up as\nthough by summer lightning from the corner where Michael sat. They all\nlooked towards him and saw him sitting, his hands folded on his knees,\ngazing upwards and smiling.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\nThe woman went away with the girls. Michael rose from the bench, put\ndown his work, and took off his apron. Then, bowing low to Simon and\nhis wife, he said: "Farewell, masters. God has forgiven me. I ask your\nforgiveness, too, for anything done amiss."\n\nAnd they saw that a light shone from Michael. And Simon rose, bowed down\nto Michael, and said: "I see, Michael, that you are no common man, and I\ncan neither keep you nor question you. Only tell me this: how is it that\nwhen I found you and brought you home, you were gloomy, and when my\nwife gave you food you smiled at her and became brighter? Then when the\ngentleman came to order the boots, you smiled again and became brighter\nstill? And now, when this woman brought the little girls, you smiled a\nthird time, and have become as bright as day? Tell me, Michael, why does\nyour face shine so, and why did you smile those three times?"\n\nAnd Michael answered: "Light shines from me because I have been\npunished, but now God has pardoned me. And I smiled three times, because\nGod sent me to learn three truths, and I have learnt them. One I learnt\nwhen your wife pitied me, and that is why I smiled the first time. The\nsecond I learnt when the rich man ordered the boots, and then I smiled\nagain. And now, when I saw those little girls, I learn the third and\nlast truth, and I smiled the third time."\n\nAnd Simon said, "Tell me, Michael, what did God punish you for? and what\nwere the three truths? that I, too, may know them."\n\nAnd Michael answered: "God punished me for disobeying Him. I was an\nangel in heaven and disobeyed God. God sent me to fetch a woman\'s soul.\nI flew to earth, and saw a sick woman lying alone, who had just given\nbirth to twin girls. They moved feebly at their mother\'s side, but she\ncould not lift them to her breast. When she saw me, she understood that\nGod had sent me for her soul, and she wept and said: \'Angel of God! My\nhusband has just been buried, killed by a falling tree. I have neither\nsister, nor aunt, nor mother: no one to care for my orphans. Do not take\nmy soul! Let me nurse my babes, feed them, and set them on their feet\nbefore I die. Children cannot live without father or mother.\' And I\nhearkened to her. I placed one child at her breast and gave the other\ninto her arms, and returned to the Lord in heaven. I flew to the Lord,\nand said: \'I could not take the soul of the mother. Her husband was\nkilled by a tree; the woman has twins, and prays that her soul may not\nbe taken. She says: "Let me nurse and feed my children, and set them on\ntheir feet. Children cannot live without father or mother." I have not\ntaken her soul.\' And God said: \'Go-take the mother\'s soul, and learn\nthree truths: Learn What dwells in man, What is not given to man, and\nWhat men live by. When thou has learnt these things, thou shalt return\nto heaven.\' So I flew again to earth and took the mother\'s soul. The\nbabes dropped from her breasts. Her body rolled over on the bed and\ncrushed one babe, twisting its leg. I rose above the village, wishing\nto take her soul to God; but a wind seized me, and my wings drooped and\ndropped off. Her soul rose alone to God, while I fell to earth by the\nroadside."\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\nAnd Simon and Matryona understood who it was that had lived with them,\nand whom they had clothed and fed. And they wept with awe and with joy.\nAnd the angel said: "I was alone in the field, naked. I had never known\nhuman needs, cold and hunger, till I became a man. I was famished,\nfrozen, and did not know what to do. I saw, near the field I was in, a\nshrine built for God, and I went to it hoping to find shelter. But\nthe shrine was locked, and I could not enter. So I sat down behind the\nshrine to shelter myself at least from the wind. Evening drew on. I was\nhungry, frozen, and in pain. Suddenly I heard a man coming along the\nroad. He carried a pair of boots, and was talking to himself. For the\nfirst time since I became a man I saw the mortal face of a man, and his\nface seemed terrible to me and I turned from it. And I heard the man\ntalking to himself of how to cover his body from the cold in winter, and\nhow to feed wife and children. And I thought: \'I am perishing of cold\nand hunger, and here is a man thinking only of how to clothe himself and\nhis wife, and how to get bread for themselves. He cannot help me.\' When\nthe man saw me he frowned and became still more terrible, and passed me\nby on the other side. I despaired; but suddenly I heard him coming back.\nI looked up, and did not recognize the same man; before, I had seen\ndeath in his face; but now he was alive, and I recognized in him the\npresence of God. He came up to me, clothed me, took me with him, and\nbrought me to his home. I entered the house; a woman came to meet us and\nbegan to speak. The woman was still more terrible than the man had been;\nthe spirit of death came from her mouth; I could not breathe for the\nstench of death that spread around her. She wished to drive me out into\nthe cold, and I knew that if she did so she would die. Suddenly her\nhusband spoke to her of God, and the woman changed at once. And when she\nbrought me food and looked at me, I glanced at her and saw that death no\nlonger dwelt in her; she had become alive, and in her, too, I saw God.\n\n"Then I remembered the first lesson God had set me: \'Learn what dwells\nin man.\' And I understood that in man dwells Love! I was glad that God\nhad already begun to show me what He had promised, and I smiled for the\nfirst time. But I had not yet learnt all. I did not yet know What is not\ngiven to man, and What men live by.\n\n"I lived with you, and a year passed. A man came to order boots that\nshould wear for a year without losing shape or cracking. I looked at\nhim, and suddenly, behind his shoulder, I saw my comrade--the angel of\ndeath. None but me saw that angel; but I knew him, and knew that before\nthe sun set he would take that rich man\'s soul. And I thought to myself,\n\'The man is making preparations for a year, and does not know that he\nwill die before evening.\' And I remembered God\'s second saying, \'Learn\nwhat is not given to man.\'\n\n"What dwells in man I already knew. Now I learnt what is not given\nhim. It is not given to man to know his own needs. And I smiled for the\nsecond time. I was glad to have seen my comrade angel--glad also that\nGod had revealed to me the second saying.\n\n"But I still did not know all. I did not know What men live by. And I\nlived on, waiting till God should reveal to me the last lesson. In the\nsixth year came the girl-twins with the woman; and I recognized the\ngirls, and heard how they had been kept alive. Having heard the story,\nI thought, \'Their mother besought me for the children\'s sake, and I\nbelieved her when she said that children cannot live without father or\nmother; but a stranger has nursed them, and has brought them up.\' And\nwhen the woman showed her love for the children that were not her own,\nand wept over them, I saw in her the living God and understood What men\nlive by. And I knew that God had revealed to me the last lesson, and had\nforgiven my sin. And then I smiled for the third time."\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\nAnd the angel\'s body was bared, and he was clothed in light so that eye\ncould not look on him; and his voice grew louder, as though it came not\nfrom him but from heaven above. And the angel said:\n\n"I have learnt that all men live not by care for themselves but by love.\n\n"It was not given to the mother to know what her children needed for\ntheir life. Nor was it given to the rich man to know what he himself\nneeded. Nor is it given to any man to know whether, when evening comes,\nhe will need boots for his body or slippers for his corpse.\n\n"I remained alive when I was a man, not by care of myself, but because\nlove was present in a passer-by, and because he and his wife pitied and\nloved me. The orphans remained alive not because of their mother\'s care,\nbut because there was love in the heart of a woman, a stranger to them,\nwho pitied and loved them. And all men live not by the thought they\nspend on their own welfare, but because love exists in man.\n\n"I knew before that God gave life to men and desires that they should\nlive; now I understood more than that.\n\n"I understood that God does not wish men to live apart, and therefore he\ndoes not reveal to them what each one needs for himself; but he wishes\nthem to live united, and therefore reveals to each of them what is\nnecessary for all.\n\n"I have now understood that though it seems to men that they live by\ncare for themselves, in truth it is love alone by which they live. He\nwho has love, is in God, and God is in him, for God is love."\n\nAnd the angel sang praise to God, so that the hut trembled at his voice.\nThe roof opened, and a column of fire rose from earth to heaven. Simon\nand his wife and children fell to the ground. Wings appeared upon the\nangel\'s shoulders, and he rose into the heavens.\n\nAnd when Simon came to himself the hut stood as before, and there was no\none in it but his own family.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHREE QUESTIONS\n\n\nIt once occurred to a certain king, that if he always knew the right\ntime to begin everything; if he knew who were the right people to listen\nto, and whom to avoid; and, above all, if he always knew what was the\nmost important thing to do, he would never fail in anything he might\nundertake.\n\nAnd this thought having occurred to him, he had it proclaimed throughout\nhis kingdom that he would give a great reward to any one who would teach\nhim what was the right time for every action, and who were the most\nnecessary people, and how he might know what was the most important\nthing to do.\n\nAnd learned men came to the King, but they all answered his questions\ndifferently.\n\nIn reply to the first question, some said that to know the right time\nfor every action, one must draw up in advance, a table of days, months\nand years, and must live strictly according to it. Only thus, said they,\ncould everything be done at its proper time. Others declared that it\nwas impossible to decide beforehand the right time for every action;\nbut that, not letting oneself be absorbed in idle pastimes, one should\nalways attend to all that was going on, and then do what was most\nneedful. Others, again, said that however attentive the King might be to\nwhat was going on, it was impossible for one man to decide correctly the\nright time for every action, but that he should have a Council of wise\nmen, who would help him to fix the proper time for everything.\n\nBut then again others said there were some things which could not wait\nto be laid before a Council, but about which one had at once to decide\nwhether to undertake them or not. But in order to decide that, one must\nknow beforehand what was going to happen. It is only magicians who know\nthat; and, therefore, in order to know the right time for every action,\none must consult magicians.\n\nEqually various were the answers to the second question. Some said, the\npeople the King most needed were his councillors; others, the priests;\nothers, the doctors; while some said the warriors were the most\nnecessary.\n\nTo the third question, as to what was the most important occupation:\nsome replied that the most important thing in the world was science.\nOthers said it was skill in warfare; and others, again, that it was\nreligious worship.\n\nAll the answers being different, the King agreed with none of them, and\ngave the reward to none. But still wishing to find the right answers to\nhis questions, he decided to consult a hermit, widely renowned for his\nwisdom.\n\nThe hermit lived in a wood which he never quitted, and he received none\nbut common folk. So the King put on simple clothes, and before reaching\nthe hermit\'s cell dismounted from his horse, and, leaving his body-guard\nbehind, went on alone.\n\nWhen the King approached, the hermit was digging the ground in front of\nhis hut. Seeing the King, he greeted him and went on digging. The hermit\nwas frail and weak, and each time he stuck his spade into the ground and\nturned a little earth, he breathed heavily.\n\nThe King went up to him and said: "I have come to you, wise hermit, to\nask you to answer three questions: How can I learn to do the right thing\nat the right time? Who are the people I most need, and to whom should\nI, therefore, pay more attention than to the rest? And, what affairs are\nthe most important, and need my first attention?"\n\nThe hermit listened to the King, but answered nothing. He just spat on\nhis hand and recommenced digging.\n\n"You are tired," said the King, "let me take the spade and work awhile\nfor you."\n\n"Thanks!" said the hermit, and, giving the spade to the King, he sat\ndown on the ground.\n\nWhen he had dug two beds, the King stopped and repeated his questions.\nThe hermit again gave no answer, but rose, stretched out his hand for\nthe spade, and said:\n\n"Now rest awhile-and let me work a bit."\n\nBut the King did not give him the spade, and continued to dig. One hour\npassed, and another. The sun began to sink behind the trees, and the\nKing at last stuck the spade into the ground, and said:\n\n"I came to you, wise man, for an answer to my questions. If you can give\nme none, tell me so, and I will return home."\n\n"Here comes some one running," said the hermit, "let us see who it is."\n\nThe King turned round, and saw a bearded man come running out of the\nwood. The man held his hands pressed against his stomach, and blood was\nflowing from under them. When he reached the King, he fell fainting on\nthe ground moaning feebly. The King and the hermit unfastened the man\'s\nclothing. There was a large wound in his stomach. The King washed it as\nbest he could, and bandaged it with his handkerchief and with a towel\nthe hermit had. But the blood would not stop flowing, and the King again\nand again removed the bandage soaked with warm blood, and washed and\nrebandaged the wound. When at last the blood ceased flowing, the man\nrevived and asked for something to drink. The King brought fresh water\nand gave it to him. Meanwhile the sun had set, and it had become cool.\nSo the King, with the hermit\'s help, carried the wounded man into the\nhut and laid him on the bed. Lying on the bed the man closed his eyes\nand was quiet; but the King was so tired with his walk and with the\nwork he had done, that he crouched down on the threshold, and also fell\nasleep--so soundly that he slept all through the short summer night.\nWhen he awoke in the morning, it was long before he could remember where\nhe was, or who was the strange bearded man lying on the bed and gazing\nintently at him with shining eyes.\n\n"Forgive me!" said the bearded man in a weak voice, when he saw that the\nKing was awake and was looking at him.\n\n"I do not know you, and have nothing to forgive you for," said the King.\n\n"You do not know me, but I know you. I am that enemy of yours who swore\nto revenge himself on you, because you executed his brother and seized\nhis property. I knew you had gone alone to see the hermit, and I\nresolved to kill you on your way back. But the day passed and you did\nnot return. So I came out from my ambush to find you, and I came upon\nyour bodyguard, and they recognized me, and wounded me. I escaped from\nthem, but should have bled to death had you not dressed my wound. I\nwished to kill you, and you have saved my life. Now, if I live, and if\nyou wish it, I will serve you as your most faithful slave, and will bid\nmy sons do the same. Forgive me!"\n\nThe King was very glad to have made peace with his enemy so easily, and\nto have gained him for a friend, and he not only forgave him, but said\nhe would send his servants and his own physician to attend him, and\npromised to restore his property.\n\nHaving taken leave of the wounded man, the King went out into the porch\nand looked around for the hermit. Before going away he wished once more\nto beg an answer to the questions he had put. The hermit was outside, on\nhis knees, sowing seeds in the beds that had been dug the day before.\n\nThe King approached him, and said:\n\n"For the last time, I pray you to answer my questions, wise man."\n\n"You have already been answered!" said the hermit, still crouching on\nhis thin legs, and looking up at the King, who stood before him.\n\n"How answered? What do you mean?" asked the King.\n\n"Do you not see," replied the hermit. "If you had not pitied my weakness\nyesterday, and had not dug those beds for me, but had gone your way,\nthat man would have attacked you, and you would have repented of not\nhaving stayed with me. So the most important time was when you were\ndigging the beds; and I was the most important man; and to do me good\nwas your most important business. Afterwards when that man ran to us,\nthe most important time was when you were attending to him, for if you\nhad not bound up his wounds he would have died without having made peace\nwith you. So he was the most important man, and what you did for him was\nyour most important business. Remember then: there is only one time that\nis important--Now! It is the most important time because it is the only\ntime when we have any power. The most necessary man is he with whom you\nare, for no man knows whether he will ever have dealings with any one\nelse: and the most important affair is, to do him good, because for that\npurpose alone was man sent into this life!"\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE COFFEE-HOUSE OF SURAT\n\n(After Bernardin de Saint-Pierre)\n\n\nIn the town of Surat, in India, was a coffee-house where many travellers\nand foreigners from all parts of the world met and conversed.\n\nOne day a learned Persian theologian visited this coffee-house. He was a\nman who had spent his life studying the nature of the Deity, and reading\nand writing books upon the subject. He had thought, read, and written so\nmuch about God, that eventually he lost his wits, became quite confused,\nand ceased even to believe in the existence of a God. The Shah, hearing\nof this, had banished him from Persia.\n\nAfter having argued all his life about the First Cause, this unfortunate\ntheologian had ended by quite perplexing himself, and instead of\nunderstanding that he had lost his own reason, he began to think that\nthere was no higher Reason controlling the universe.\n\nThis man had an African slave who followed him everywhere. When the\ntheologian entered the coffee-house, the slave remained outside, near\nthe door, sitting on a stone in the glare of the sun, and driving away\nthe flies that buzzed around him. The Persian having settled down on a\ndivan in the coffee-house, ordered himself a cup of opium. When he had\ndrunk it and the opium had begun to quicken the workings of his brain,\nhe addressed his slave through the open door:\n\n"Tell me, wretched slave," said he, "do you think there is a God, or\nnot?"\n\n"Of course there is," said the slave, and immediately drew from under\nhis girdle a small idol of wood.\n\n"There," said he, "that is the God who has guarded me from the day of my\nbirth. Every one in our country worships the fetish tree, from the wood\nof which this God was made."\n\nThis conversation between the theologian and his slave was listened\nto with surprise by the other guests in the coffee-house. They were\nastonished at the master\'s question, and yet more so at the slave\'s\nreply.\n\nOne of them, a Brahmin, on hearing the words spoken by the slave, turned\nto him and said:\n\n"Miserable fool! Is it possible you believe that God can be carried\nunder a man\'s girdle? There is one God--Brahma, and he is greater than\nthe whole world, for he created it. Brahma is the One, the mighty God,\nand in His honour are built the temples on the Ganges\' banks, where his\ntrue priests, the Brahmins, worship him. They know the true God, and\nnone but they. A thousand score of years have passed, and yet through\nrevolution after revolution these priests have held their sway, because\nBrahma, the one true God, has protected them."\n\nSo spoke the Brahmin, thinking to convince every one; but a Jewish\nbroker who was present replied to him, and said:\n\n"No! the temple of the true God is not in India. Neither does God\nprotect the Brahmin caste. The true God is not the God of the Brahmins,\nbut of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. None does He protect but His chosen\npeople, the Israelites. From the commencement of the world, our nation\nhas been beloved of Him, and ours alone. If we are now scattered over\nthe whole earth, it is but to try us; for God has promised that He will\none day gather His people together in Jerusalem. Then, with the Temple\nof Jerusalem--the wonder of the ancient world--restored to its splendor,\nshall Israel be established a ruler over all nations."\n\nSo spoke the Jew, and burst into tears. He wished to say more, but an\nItalian missionary who was there interrupted him.\n\n"What you are saying is untrue," said he to the Jew. "You attribute\ninjustice to God. He cannot love your nation above the rest. Nay rather,\neven if it be true that of old He favored the Israelites, it is now\nnineteen hundred years since they angered Him, and caused Him to destroy\ntheir nation and scatter them over the earth, so that their faith makes\nno converts and has died out except here and there. God shows preference\nto no nation, but calls all who wish to be saved to the bosom of the\nCatholic Church of Rome, the one outside whose borders no salvation can\nbe found."\n\nSo spoke the Italian. But a Protestant minister, who happened to be\npresent, growing pale, turned to the Catholic missionary and exclaimed:\n\n"How can you say that salvation belongs to your religion? Those only\nwill be saved, who serve God according to the Gospel, in spirit and in\ntruth, as bidden by the word of Christ."\n\nThen a Turk, an office-holder in the custom-house at Surat, who was\nsitting in the coffee-house smoking a pipe, turned with an air of\nsuperiority to both the Christians.\n\n"Your belief in your Roman religion is vain," said he. "It was\nsuperseded twelve hundred years ago by the true faith: that of Mohammed!\nYou cannot but observe how the true Mohammed faith continues to spread\nboth in Europe and Asia, and even in the enlightened country of China.\nYou say yourselves that God has rejected the Jews; and, as a proof, you\nquote the fact that the Jews are humiliated and their faith does not\nspread. Confess then the truth of Mohammedanism, for it is triumphant\nand spreads far and wide. None will be saved but the followers of\nMohammed, God\'s latest prophet; and of them, only the followers of Omar,\nand not of Ali, for the latter are false to the faith."\n\nTo this the Persian theologian, who was of the sect of Ali, wished\nto reply; but by this time a great dispute had arisen among all the\nstrangers of different faiths and creeds present. There were Abyssinian\nChristians, Llamas from Thibet, Ismailians and Fireworshippers. They all\nargued about the nature of God, and how He should be worshipped. Each\nof them asserted that in his country alone was the true God known and\nrightly worshipped.\n\nEvery one argued and shouted, except a Chinaman, a student of Confucius,\nwho sat quietly in one corner of the coffee-house, not joining in the\ndispute. He sat there drinking tea and listening to what the others\nsaid, but did not speak himself.\n\nThe Turk noticed him sitting there, and appealed to him, saying:\n\n"You can confirm what I say, my good Chinaman. You hold your peace,\nbut if you spoke I know you would uphold my opinion. Traders from\nyour country, who come to me for assistance, tell me that though\nmany religions have been introduced into China, you Chinese consider\nMohammedanism the best of all, and adopt it willingly. Confirm, then, my\nwords, and tell us your opinion of the true God and of His prophet."\n\n"Yes, yes," said the rest, turning to the Chinaman, "let us hear what\nyou think on the subject."\n\nThe Chinaman, the student of Confucius, closed his eyes, and thought a\nwhile. Then he opened them again, and drawing his hands out of the wide\nsleeves of his garment, and folding them on his breast, he spoke as\nfollows, in a calm and quiet voice.\n\nSirs, it seems to me that it is chiefly pride that prevents men agreeing\nwith one another on matters of faith. If you care to listen to me, I\nwill tell you a story which will explain this by an example.\n\nI came here from China on an English steamer which had been round the\nworld. We stopped for fresh water, and landed on the east coast of the\nisland of Sumatra. It was midday, and some of us, having landed, sat in\nthe shade of some cocoanut palms by the seashore, not far from a native\nvillage. We were a party of men of different nationalities.\n\nAs we sat there, a blind man approached us. We learned afterwards that\nhe had gone blind from gazing too long and too persistently at the sun,\ntrying to find out what it is, in order to seize its light.\n\nHe strove a long time to accomplish this, constantly looking at the sun;\nbut the only result was that his eyes were injured by its brightness,\nand he became blind.\n\nThen he said to himself:\n\n"The light of the sun is not a liquid; for if it were a liquid it would\nbe possible to pour it from one vessel into another, and it would be\nmoved, like water, by the wind. Neither is it fire; for if it were fire,\nwater would extinguish it. Neither is light a spirit, for it is seen\nby the eye; nor is it matter, for it cannot be moved. Therefore, as the\nlight of the sun is neither liquid, nor fire, nor spirit, nor matter, it\nis--nothing!"\n\nSo he argued, and, as a result of always looking at the sun and always\nthinking about it, he lost both his sight and his reason. And when he\nwent quite blind, he became fully convinced that the sun did not exist.\n\nWith this blind man came a slave, who after placing his master in the\nshade of a cocoanut tree, picked up a cocoanut from the ground, and\nbegan making it into a night-light. He twisted a wick from the fibre\nof the cocoanut: squeezed oil from the nut in the shell, and soaked the\nwick in it.\n\nAs the slave sat doing this, the blind man sighed and said to him:\n\n"Well, slave, was I not right when I told you there is no sun? Do you\nnot see how dark it is? Yet people say there is a sun.... But if so,\nwhat is it?"\n\n"I do not know what the sun is," said the slave. "That is no business of\nmine. But I know what light is. Here I have made a night-light, by the\nhelp of which I can serve you and find anything I want in the hut."\n\nAnd the slave picked up the cocoanut shell, saying:\n\n"This is my sun."\n\nA lame man with crutches, who was sitting near by, heard these words,\nand laughed:\n\n"You have evidently been blind all your life," said he to the blind man,\n"not to know what the sun is. I will tell you what it is. The sun is\na ball of fire, which rises every morning out of the sea and goes down\nagain among the mountains of our island each evening. We have all seen\nthis, and if you had had your eyesight you too would have seen it."\n\nA fisherman, who had been listening to the conversation said:\n\n"It is plain enough that you have never been beyond your own island. If\nyou were not lame, and if you had been out as I have in a fishing-boat,\nyou would know that the sun does not set among the mountains of our\nisland, but as it rises from the ocean every morning so it sets again in\nthe sea every night. What I am telling you is true, for I see it every\nday with my own eyes."\n\nThen an Indian who was of our party, interrupted him by saying:\n\n"I am astonished that a reasonable man should talk such nonsense.\nHow can a ball of fire possibly descend into the water and not be\nextinguished? The sun is not a ball of fire at all, it is the Deity\nnamed Deva, who rides for ever in a chariot round the golden mountain,\nMeru. Sometimes the evil serpents Ragu and Ketu attack Deva and swallow\nhim: and then the earth is dark. But our priests pray that the Deity may\nbe released, and then he is set free. Only such ignorant men as you, who\nhave never been beyond their own island, can imagine that the sun shines\nfor their country alone."\n\nThen the master of an Egyptian vessel, who was present, spoke in his\nturn.\n\n"No," said he, "you also are wrong. The sun is not a Deity, and does not\nmove only round India and its golden mountain. I have sailed much on the\nBlack Sea, and along the coasts of Arabia, and have been to Madagascar\nand to the Philippines. The sun lights the whole earth, and not India\nalone. It does not circle round one mountain, but rises far in the East,\nbeyond the Isles of Japan, and sets far, far away in the West, beyond\nthe islands of England. That is why the Japanese call their country\n\'Nippon,\' that is, \'the birth of the sun.\' I know this well, for I have\nmyself seen much, and heard more from my grandfather, who sailed to the\nvery ends of the sea."\n\nHe would have gone on, but an English sailor from our ship interrupted\nhim.\n\n"There is no country," he said "where people know so much about the\nsun\'s movements as in England. The sun, as every one in England knows,\nrises nowhere and sets nowhere. It is always moving round the earth. We\ncan be sure of this for we have just been round the world ourselves,\nand nowhere knocked up against the sun. Wherever we went, the sun showed\nitself in the morning and hid itself at night, just as it does here."\n\nAnd the Englishman took a stick and, drawing circles on the sand, tried\nto explain how the sun moves in the heavens and goes round the world.\nBut he was unable to explain it clearly, and pointing to the ship\'s\npilot said:\n\n"This man knows more about it than I do. He can explain it properly."\n\nThe pilot, who was an intelligent man, had listened in silence to the\ntalk till he was asked to speak. Now every one turned to him, and he\nsaid:\n\n"You are all misleading one another, and are yourselves deceived. The\nsun does not go round the earth, but the earth goes round the sun,\nrevolving as it goes, and turning towards the sun in the course of each\ntwenty-four hours, not only Japan, and the Philippines, and Sumatra\nwhere we now are, but Africa, and Europe, and America, and many lands\nbesides. The sun does not shine for some one mountain, or for some one\nisland, or for some one sea, nor even for one earth alone, but for other\nplanets as well as our earth. If you would only look up at the heavens,\ninstead of at the ground beneath your own feet, you might all understand\nthis, and would then no longer suppose that the sun shines for you, or\nfor your country alone."\n\nThus spoke the wise pilot, who had voyaged much about the world, and had\ngazed much upon the heavens above.\n\n"So on matters of faith," continued the Chinaman, the student of\nConfucius, "it is pride that causes error and discord among men. As with\nthe sun, so it is with God. Each man wants to have a special God of his\nown, or at least a special God for his native land. Each nation wishes\nto confine in its own temples Him, whom the world cannot contain.\n\n"Can any temple compare with that which God Himself has built to unite\nall men in one faith and one religion?\n\n"All human temples are built on the model of this temple, which is God\'s\nown world. Every temple has its fonts, its vaulted roof, its lamps,\nits pictures or sculptures, its inscriptions, its books of the law, its\nofferings, its altars and its priests. But in what temple is there such\na font as the ocean; such a vault as that of the heavens; such lamps\nas the sun, moon, and stars; or any figures to be compared with living,\nloving, mutually-helpful men? Where are there any records of God\'s\ngoodness so easy to understand as the blessings which God has strewn\nabroad for man\'s happiness? Where is there any book of the law so clear\nto each man as that written in his heart? What sacrifices equal the\nself-denials which loving men and women make for one another? And what\naltar can be compared with the heart of a good man, on which God Himself\naccepts the sacrifice?\n\n"The higher a man\'s conception of God, the better will he know Him. And\nthe better he knows God, the nearer will he draw to Him, imitating His\ngoodness, His mercy, and His love of man.\n\n"Therefore, let him who sees the sun\'s whole light filling the world,\nrefrain from blaming or despising the superstitious man, who in his\nown idol sees one ray of that same light. Let him not despise even the\nunbeliever who is blind and cannot see the sun at all."\n\nSo spoke the Chinaman, the student of Confucius; and all who were\npresent in the coffee-house were silent, and disputed no more as to\nwhose faith was the best.\n\n\n\n\nHOW MUCH LAND DOES A MAN NEED?\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nAn elder sister came to visit her younger sister in the country. The\nelder was married to a tradesman in town, the younger to a peasant in\nthe village. As the sisters sat over their tea talking, the elder began\nto boast of the advantages of town life: saying how comfortably they\nlived there, how well they dressed, what fine clothes her children wore,\nwhat good things they ate and drank, and how she went to the theatre,\npromenades, and entertainments.\n\nThe younger sister was piqued, and in turn disparaged the life of a\ntradesman, and stood up for that of a peasant.\n\n"I would not change my way of life for yours," said she. "We may live\nroughly, but at least we are free from anxiety. You live in better style\nthan we do, but though you often earn more than you need, you are very\nlikely to lose all you have. You know the proverb, \'Loss and gain are\nbrothers twain.\' It often happens that people who are wealthy one day\nare begging their bread the next. Our way is safer. Though a peasant\'s\nlife is not a fat one, it is a long one. We shall never grow rich, but\nwe shall always have enough to eat."\n\nThe elder sister said sneeringly:\n\n"Enough? Yes, if you like to share with the pigs and the calves! What do\nyou know of elegance or manners! However much your good man may slave,\nyou will die as you are living-on a dung heap-and your children the\nsame."\n\n"Well, what of that?" replied the younger. "Of course our work is rough\nand coarse. But, on the other hand, it is sure; and we need not bow to\nany one. But you, in your towns, are surrounded by temptations; today\nall may be right, but tomorrow the Evil One may tempt your husband with\ncards, wine, or women, and all will go to ruin. Don\'t such things happen\noften enough?"\n\nPahom, the master of the house, was lying on the top of the oven, and he\nlistened to the women\'s chatter.\n\n"It is perfectly true," thought he. "Busy as we are from childhood\ntilling Mother Earth, we peasants have no time to let any nonsense\nsettle in our heads. Our only trouble is that we haven\'t land enough. If\nI had plenty of land, I shouldn\'t fear the Devil himself!"\n\nThe women finished their tea, chatted a while about dress, and then\ncleared away the tea-things and lay down to sleep.\n\nBut the Devil had been sitting behind the oven, and had heard all that\nwas said. He was pleased that the peasant\'s wife had led her husband\ninto boasting, and that he had said that if he had plenty of land he\nwould not fear the Devil himself.\n\n"All right," thought the Devil. "We will have a tussle. I\'ll give you\nland enough; and by means of that land I will get you into my power."\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nClose to the village there lived a lady, a small landowner, who had an\nestate of about three hundred acres. She had always lived on good terms\nwith the peasants, until she engaged as her steward an old soldier, who\ntook to burdening the people with fines. However careful Pahom tried to\nbe, it happened again and again that now a horse of his got among the\nlady\'s oats, now a cow strayed into her garden, now his calves found\ntheir way into her meadows-and he always had to pay a fine.\n\nPahom paid, but grumbled, and, going home in a temper, was rough with\nhis family. All through that summer Pahom had much trouble because of\nthis steward; and he was even glad when winter came and the cattle had\nto be stabled. Though he grudged the fodder when they could no longer\ngraze on the pasture-land, at least he was free from anxiety about them.\n\nIn the winter the news got about that the lady was going to sell her\nland, and that the keeper of the inn on the high road was bargaining for\nit. When the peasants heard this they were very much alarmed.\n\n"Well," thought they, "if the innkeeper gets the land he will worry us\nwith fines worse than the lady\'s steward. We all depend on that estate."\n\nSo the peasants went on behalf of their Commune, and asked the lady not\nto sell the land to the innkeeper; offering her a better price for it\nthemselves. The lady agreed to let them have it. Then the peasants tried\nto arrange for the Commune to buy the whole estate, so that it might\nbe held by all in common. They met twice to discuss it, but could not\nsettle the matter; the Evil One sowed discord among them, and they could\nnot agree. So they decided to buy the land individually, each according\nto his means; and the lady agreed to this plan as she had to the other.\n\nPresently Pahom heard that a neighbor of his was buying fifty acres,\nand that the lady had consented to accept one half in cash and to wait a\nyear for the other half. Pahom felt envious.\n\n"Look at that," thought he, "the land is all being sold, and I shall get\nnone of it." So he spoke to his wife.\n\n"Other people are buying," said he, "and we must also buy twenty acres\nor so. Life is becoming impossible. That steward is simply crushing us\nwith his fines."\n\nSo they put their heads together and considered how they could manage to\nbuy it. They had one hundred roubles laid by. They sold a colt, and one\nhalf of their bees; hired out one of their sons as a laborer, and took\nhis wages in advance; borrowed the rest from a brother-in-law, and so\nscraped together half the purchase money.\n\nHaving done this, Pahom chose out a farm of forty acres, some of\nit wooded, and went to the lady to bargain for it. They came to an\nagreement, and he shook hands with her upon it, and paid her a deposit\nin advance. Then they went to town and signed the deeds; he paying half\nthe price down, and undertaking to pay the remainder within two years.\n\nSo now Pahom had land of his own. He borrowed seed, and sowed it on the\nland he had bought. The harvest was a good one, and within a year he had\nmanaged to pay off his debts both to the lady and to his brother-in-law.\nSo he became a landowner, ploughing and sowing his own land, making hay\non his own land, cutting his own trees, and feeding his cattle on his\nown pasture. When he went out to plough his fields, or to look at his\ngrowing corn, or at his grass meadows, his heart would fill with joy.\nThe grass that grew and the flowers that bloomed there, seemed to him\nunlike any that grew elsewhere. Formerly, when he had passed by that\nland, it had appeared the same as any other land, but now it seemed\nquite different.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nSo Pahom was well contented, and everything would have been right if the\nneighboring peasants would only not have trespassed on his corn-fields\nand meadows. He appealed to them most civilly, but they still went on:\nnow the Communal herdsmen would let the village cows stray into his\nmeadows; then horses from the night pasture would get among his corn.\nPahom turned them out again and again, and forgave their owners, and\nfor a long time he forbore from prosecuting any one. But at last he\nlost patience and complained to the District Court. He knew it was the\npeasants\' want of land, and no evil intent on their part, that caused\nthe trouble; but he thought:\n\n"I cannot go on overlooking it, or they will destroy all I have. They\nmust be taught a lesson."\n\nSo he had them up, gave them one lesson, and then another, and two or\nthree of the peasants were fined. After a time Pahom\'s neighbours began\nto bear him a grudge for this, and would now and then let their cattle\non his land on purpose. One peasant even got into Pahom\'s wood at night\nand cut down five young lime trees for their bark. Pahom passing through\nthe wood one day noticed something white. He came nearer, and saw the\nstripped trunks lying on the ground, and close by stood the stumps,\nwhere the tree had been. Pahom was furious.\n\n"If he had only cut one here and there it would have been bad enough,"\nthought Pahom, "but the rascal has actually cut down a whole clump. If I\ncould only find out who did this, I would pay him out."\n\nHe racked his brains as to who it could be. Finally he decided: "It\nmust be Simon-no one else could have done it." Se he went to Simon\'s\nhomestead to have a look around, but he found nothing, and only had an\nangry scene. However\' he now felt more certain than ever that Simon had\ndone it, and he lodged a complaint. Simon was summoned. The case was\ntried, and re-tried, and at the end of it all Simon was acquitted, there\nbeing no evidence against him. Pahom felt still more aggrieved, and let\nhis anger loose upon the Elder and the Judges.\n\n"You let thieves grease your palms," said he. "If you were honest folk\nyourselves, you would not let a thief go free."\n\nSo Pahom quarrelled with the Judges and with his neighbors. Threats to\nburn his building began to be uttered. So though Pahom had more land,\nhis place in the Commune was much worse than before.\n\nAbout this time a rumor got about that many people were moving to new\nparts.\n\n"There\'s no need for me to leave my land," thought Pahom. "But some of\nthe others might leave our village, and then there would be more room\nfor us. I would take over their land myself, and make my estate a bit\nbigger. I could then live more at ease. As it is, I am still too cramped\nto be comfortable."\n\nOne day Pahom was sitting at home, when a peasant passing through the\nvillage, happened to call in. He was allowed to stay the night, and\nsupper was given him. Pahom had a talk with this peasant and asked him\nwhere he came from. The stranger answered that he came from beyond the\nVolga, where he had been working. One word led to another, and the man\nwent on to say that many people were settling in those parts. He told\nhow some people from his village had settled there. They had joined the\nCommune, and had had twenty-five acres per man granted them. The land\nwas so good, he said, that the rye sown on it grew as high as a horse,\nand so thick that five cuts of a sickle made a sheaf. One peasant, he\nsaid, had brought nothing with him but his bare hands, and now he had\nsix horses and two cows of his own.\n\nPahom\'s heart kindled with desire. He thought:\n\n"Why should I suffer in this narrow hole, if one can live so well\nelsewhere? I will sell my land and my homestead here, and with the money\nI will start afresh over there and get everything new. In this crowded\nplace one is always having trouble. But I must first go and find out all\nabout it myself."\n\nTowards summer he got ready and started. He went down the Volga on a\nsteamer to Samara, then walked another three hundred miles on foot, and\nat last reached the place. It was just as the stranger had said. The\npeasants had plenty of land: every man had twenty-five acres of Communal\nland given him for his use, and any one who had money could buy,\nbesides, at fifty-cents an acre as much good freehold land as he wanted.\n\nHaving found out all he wished to know, Pahom returned home as autumn\ncame on, and began selling off his belongings. He sold his land at\na profit, sold his homestead and all his cattle, and withdrew from\nmembership of the Commune. He only waited till the spring, and then\nstarted with his family for the new settlement.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nAs soon as Pahom and his family arrived at their new abode, he applied\nfor admission into the Commune of a large village. He stood treat to the\nElders, and obtained the necessary documents. Five shares of Communal\nland were given him for his own and his sons\' use: that is to say--125\nacres (not altogether, but in different fields) besides the use of\nthe Communal pasture. Pahom put up the buildings he needed, and bought\ncattle. Of the Communal land alone he had three times as much as at his\nformer home, and the land was good corn-land. He was ten times better\noff than he had been. He had plenty of arable land and pasturage, and\ncould keep as many head of cattle as he liked.\n\nAt first, in the bustle of building and settling down, Pahom was pleased\nwith it all, but when he got used to it he began to think that even here\nhe had not enough land. The first year, he sowed wheat on his share of\nthe Communal land, and had a good crop. He wanted to go on sowing\nwheat, but had not enough Communal land for the purpose, and what he had\nalready used was not available; for in those parts wheat is only sown on\nvirgin soil or on fallow land. It is sown for one or two years, and\nthen the land lies fallow till it is again overgrown with prairie grass.\nThere were many who wanted such land, and there was not enough for all;\nso that people quarrelled about it. Those who were better off, wanted it\nfor growing wheat, and those who were poor, wanted it to let to dealers,\nso that they might raise money to pay their taxes. Pahom wanted to sow\nmore wheat; so he rented land from a dealer for a year. He sowed\nmuch wheat and had a fine crop, but the land was too far from the\nvillage--the wheat had to be carted more than ten miles. After a time\nPahom noticed that some peasant-dealers were living on separate farms,\nand were growing wealthy; and he thought:\n\n"If I were to buy some freehold land, and have a homestead on it, it\nwould be a different thing, altogether. Then it would all be nice and\ncompact."\n\nThe question of buying freehold land recurred to him again and again.\n\nHe went on in the same way for three years; renting land and sowing\nwheat. The seasons turned out well and the crops were good, so that he\nbegan to lay money by. He might have gone on living contentedly, but he\ngrew tired of having to rent other people\'s land every year, and having\nto scramble for it. Wherever there was good land to be had, the peasants\nwould rush for it and it was taken up at once, so that unless you were\nsharp about it you got none. It happened in the third year that he and\na dealer together rented a piece of pasture land from some peasants; and\nthey had already ploughed it up, when there was some dispute, and the\npeasants went to law about it, and things fell out so that the labor\nwas all lost. "If it were my own land," thought Pahom, "I should be\nindependent, and there would not be all this unpleasantness."\n\nSo Pahom began looking out for land which he could buy; and he came\nacross a peasant who had bought thirteen hundred acres, but having got\ninto difficulties was willing to sell again cheap. Pahom bargained and\nhaggled with him, and at last they settled the price at 1,500 roubles,\npart in cash and part to be paid later. They had all but clinched the\nmatter, when a passing dealer happened to stop at Pahom\'s one day to get\na feed for his horse. He drank tea with Pahom, and they had a talk. The\ndealer said that he was just returning from the land of the Bashkirs,\nfar away, where he had bought thirteen thousand acres of land all for\n1,000 roubles. Pahom questioned him further, and the tradesman said:\n\n"All one need do is to make friends with the chiefs. I gave away about\none hundred roubles\' worth of dressing-gowns and carpets, besides a case\nof tea, and I gave wine to those who would drink it; and I got the land\nfor less than two cents an acre. And he showed Pahom the title-deeds,\nsaying:\n\n"The land lies near a river, and the whole prairie is virgin soil."\n\nPahom plied him with questions, and the tradesman said:\n\n"There is more land there than you could cover if you walked a year, and\nit all belongs to the Bashkirs. They are as simple as sheep, and land\ncan be got almost for nothing."\n\n"There now," thought Pahom, "with my one thousand roubles, why should I\nget only thirteen hundred acres, and saddle myself with a debt besides.\nIf I take it out there, I can get more than ten times as much for the\nmoney."\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nPahom inquired how to get to the place, and as soon as the tradesman\nhad left him, he prepared to go there himself. He left his wife to look\nafter the homestead, and started on his journey taking his man with\nhim. They stopped at a town on their way, and bought a case of tea, some\nwine, and other presents, as the tradesman had advised. On and on they\nwent until they had gone more than three hundred miles, and on the\nseventh day they came to a place where the Bashkirs had pitched their\ntents. It was all just as the tradesman had said. The people lived on\nthe steppes, by a river, in felt-covered tents. They neither tilled the\nground, nor ate bread. Their cattle and horses grazed in herds on the\nsteppe. The colts were tethered behind the tents, and the mares were\ndriven to them twice a day. The mares were milked, and from the milk\nkumiss was made. It was the women who prepared kumiss, and they also\nmade cheese. As far as the men were concerned, drinking kumiss and tea,\neating mutton, and playing on their pipes, was all they cared about.\nThey were all stout and merry, and all the summer long they never\nthought of doing any work. They were quite ignorant, and knew no\nRussian, but were good-natured enough.\n\nAs soon as they saw Pahom, they came out of their tents and gathered\nround their visitor. An interpreter was found, and Pahom told them he\nhad come about some land. The Bashkirs seemed very glad; they took Pahom\nand led him into one of the best tents, where they made him sit on some\ndown cushions placed on a carpet, while they sat round him. They gave\nhim tea and kumiss, and had a sheep killed, and gave him mutton to\neat. Pahom took presents out of his cart and distributed them among the\nBashkirs, and divided amongst them the tea. The Bashkirs were delighted.\nThey talked a great deal among themselves, and then told the interpreter\nto translate.\n\n"They wish to tell you," said the interpreter, "that they like you, and\nthat it is our custom to do all we can to please a guest and to repay\nhim for his gifts. You have given us presents, now tell us which of the\nthings we possess please you best, that we may present them to you."\n\n"What pleases me best here," answered Pahom, "is your land. Our land is\ncrowded, and the soil is exhausted; but you have plenty of land and it\nis good land. I never saw the like of it."\n\nThe interpreter translated. The Bashkirs talked among themselves for a\nwhile. Pahom could not understand what they were saying, but saw that\nthey were much amused, and that they shouted and laughed. Then they were\nsilent and looked at Pahom while the interpreter said:\n\n"They wish me to tell you that in return for your presents they will\ngladly give you as much land as you want. You have only to point it out\nwith your hand and it is yours."\n\nThe Bashkirs talked again for a while and began to dispute. Pahom asked\nwhat they were disputing about, and the interpreter told him that some\nof them thought they ought to ask their Chief about the land and not act\nin his absence, while others thought there was no need to wait for his\nreturn.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nWhile the Bashkirs were disputing, a man in a large fox-fur cap appeared\non the scene. They all became silent and rose to their feet. The\ninterpreter said, "This is our Chief himself."\n\nPahom immediately fetched the best dressing-gown and five pounds of\ntea, and offered these to the Chief. The Chief accepted them, and seated\nhimself in the place of honour. The Bashkirs at once began telling him\nsomething. The Chief listened for a while, then made a sign with his\nhead for them to be silent, and addressing himself to Pahom, said in\nRussian:\n\n"Well, let it be so. Choose whatever piece of land you like; we have\nplenty of it."\n\n"How can I take as much as I like?" thought Pahom. "I must get a deed to\nmake it secure, or else they may say, \'It is yours,\' and afterwards may\ntake it away again."\n\n"Thank you for your kind words," he said aloud. "You have much land, and\nI only want a little. But I should like to be sure which bit is mine.\nCould it not be measured and made over to me? Life and death are in\nGod\'s hands. You good people give it to me, but your children might wish\nto take it away again."\n\n"You are quite right," said the Chief. "We will make it over to you."\n\n"I heard that a dealer had been here," continued Pahom, "and that you\ngave him a little land, too, and signed title-deeds to that effect. I\nshould like to have it done in the same way."\n\nThe Chief understood.\n\n"Yes," replied he, "that can be done quite easily. We have a scribe, and\nwe will go to town with you and have the deed properly sealed."\n\n"And what will be the price?" asked Pahom.\n\n"Our price is always the same: one thousand roubles a day."\n\nPahom did not understand.\n\n"A day? What measure is that? How many acres would that be?"\n\n"We do not know how to reckon it out," said the Chief. "We sell it by\nthe day. As much as you can go round on your feet in a day is yours, and\nthe price is one thousand roubles a day."\n\nPahom was surprised.\n\n"But in a day you can get round a large tract of land," he said.\n\nThe Chief laughed.\n\n"It will all be yours!" said he. "But there is one condition: If you\ndon\'t return on the same day to the spot whence you started, your money\nis lost."\n\n"But how am I to mark the way that I have gone?"\n\n"Why, we shall go to any spot you like, and stay there. You must start\nfrom that spot and make your round, taking a spade with you. Wherever\nyou think necessary, make a mark. At every turning, dig a hole and pile\nup the turf; then afterwards we will go round with a plough from hole to\nhole. You may make as large a circuit as you please, but before the sun\nsets you must return to the place you started from. All the land you\ncover will be yours."\n\nPahom was delighted. It-was decided to start early next morning. They\ntalked a while, and after drinking some more kumiss and eating some more\nmutton, they had tea again, and then the night came on. They gave Pahom\na feather-bed to sleep on, and the Bashkirs dispersed for the night,\npromising to assemble the next morning at daybreak and ride out before\nsunrise to the appointed spot.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nPahom lay on the feather-bed, but could not sleep. He kept thinking\nabout the land.\n\n"What a large tract I will mark off!" thought he. "I can easily go\nthirty-five miles in a day. The days are long now, and within a circuit\nof thirty-five miles what a lot of land there will be! I will sell the\npoorer land, or let it to peasants, but I\'ll pick out the best and farm\nit. I will buy two ox-teams, and hire two more laborers. About a hundred\nand fifty acres shall be plough-land, and I will pasture cattle on the\nrest."\n\nPahom lay awake all night, and dozed off only just before dawn. Hardly\nwere his eyes closed when he had a dream. He thought he was lying in\nthat same tent, and heard somebody chuckling outside. He wondered who it\ncould be, and rose and went out, and he saw the Bashkir Chief sitting\nin front of the tent holding his side and rolling about with laughter.\nGoing nearer to the Chief, Pahom asked: "What are you laughing at?" But\nhe saw that it was no longer the Chief, but the dealer who had recently\nstopped at his house and had told him about the land. Just as Pahom\nwas going to ask, "Have you been here long?" he saw that it was not the\ndealer, but the peasant who had come up from the Volga, long ago, to\nPahom\'s old home. Then he saw that it was not the peasant either, but\nthe Devil himself with hoofs and horns, sitting there and chuckling,\nand before him lay a man barefoot, prostrate on the ground, with\nonly trousers and a shirt on. And Pahom dreamt that he looked more\nattentively to see what sort of a man it was lying there, and he saw\nthat the man was dead, and that it was himself! He awoke horror-struck.\n\n"What things one does dream," thought he.\n\nLooking round he saw through the open door that the dawn was breaking.\n\n"It\'s time to wake them up," thought he. "We ought to be starting."\n\nHe got up, roused his man (who was sleeping in his cart), bade him\nharness; and went to call the Bashkirs.\n\n"It\'s time to go to the steppe to measure the land," he said.\n\nThe Bashkirs rose and assembled, and the Chief came, too. Then they\nbegan drinking kumiss again, and offered Pahom some tea, but he would\nnot wait.\n\n"If we are to go, let us go. It is high time," said he.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nThe Bashkirs got ready and they all started: some mounted on horses, and\nsome in carts. Pahom drove in his own small cart with his servant, and\ntook a spade with him. When they reached the steppe, the morning red was\nbeginning to kindle. They ascended a hillock (called by the Bashkirs a\nshikhan) and dismounting from their carts and their horses, gathered in\none spot. The Chief came up to Pahom and stretched out his arm towards\nthe plain:\n\n"See," said he, "all this, as far as your eye can reach, is ours. You\nmay have any part of it you like."\n\nPahom\'s eyes glistened: it was all virgin soil, as flat as the palm of\nyour hand, as black as the seed of a poppy, and in the hollows different\nkinds of grasses grew breast high.\n\nThe Chief took off his fox-fur cap, placed it on the ground and said:\n\n"This will be the mark. Start from here, and return here again. All the\nland you go round shall be yours."\n\nPahom took out his money and put it on the cap. Then he took off his\nouter coat, remaining in his sleeveless under coat. He unfastened his\ngirdle and tied it tight below his stomach, put a little bag of bread\ninto the breast of his coat, and tying a flask of water to his girdle,\nhe drew up the tops of his boots, took the spade from his man, and stood\nready to start. He considered for some moments which way he had better\ngo--it was tempting everywhere.\n\n"No matter," he concluded, "I will go towards the rising sun."\n\nHe turned his face to the east, stretched himself, and waited for the\nsun to appear above the rim.\n\n"I must lose no time," he thought, "and it is easier walking while it is\nstill cool."\n\nThe sun\'s rays had hardly flashed above the horizon, before Pahom,\ncarrying the spade over his shoulder, went down into the steppe.\n\nPahom started walking neither slowly nor quickly. After having gone a\nthousand yards he stopped, dug a hole and placed pieces of turf one on\nanother to make it more visible. Then he went on; and now that he had\nwalked off his stiffness he quickened his pace. After a while he dug\nanother hole.\n\nPahom looked back. The hillock could be distinctly seen in the sunlight,\nwith the people on it, and the glittering tires of the cartwheels. At\na rough guess Pahom concluded that he had walked three miles. It\nwas growing warmer; he took off his under-coat, flung it across his\nshoulder, and went on again. It had grown quite warm now; he looked at\nthe sun, it was time to think of breakfast.\n\n"The first shift is done, but there are four in a day, and it is\ntoo soon yet to turn. But I will just take off my boots," said he to\nhimself.\n\nHe sat down, took off his boots, stuck them into his girdle, and went\non. It was easy walking now.\n\n"I will go on for another three miles," thought he, "and then turn to\nthe left. The spot is so fine, that it would be a pity to lose it. The\nfurther one goes, the better the land seems."\n\nHe went straight on a for a while, and when he looked round, the hillock\nwas scarcely visible and the people on it looked like black ants, and he\ncould just see something glistening there in the sun.\n\n"Ah," thought Pahom, "I have gone far enough in this direction, it is\ntime to turn. Besides I am in a regular sweat, and very thirsty."\n\nHe stopped, dug a large hole, and heaped up pieces of turf. Next he\nuntied his flask, had a drink, and then turned sharply to the left. He\nwent on and on; the grass was high, and it was very hot.\n\nPahom began to grow tired: he looked at the sun and saw that it was\nnoon.\n\n"Well," he thought, "I must have a rest."\n\nHe sat down, and ate some bread and drank some water; but he did not\nlie down, thinking that if he did he might fall asleep. After sitting a\nlittle while, he went on again. At first he walked easily: the food had\nstrengthened him; but it had become terribly hot, and he felt sleepy;\nstill he went on, thinking: "An hour to suffer, a life-time to live."\n\nHe went a long way in this direction also, and was about to turn to\nthe left again, when he perceived a damp hollow: "It would be a pity to\nleave that out," he thought. "Flax would do well there." So he went on\npast the hollow, and dug a hole on the other side of it before he turned\nthe corner. Pahom looked towards the hillock. The heat made the air\nhazy: it seemed to be quivering, and through the haze the people on the\nhillock could scarcely be seen.\n\n"Ah!" thought Pahom, "I have made the sides too long; I must make this\none shorter." And he went along the third side, stepping faster. He\nlooked at the sun: it was nearly half way to the horizon, and he had\nnot yet done two miles of the third side of the square. He was still ten\nmiles from the goal.\n\n"No," he thought, "though it will make my land lopsided, I must hurry\nback in a straight line now. I might go too far, and as it is I have a\ngreat deal of land."\n\nSo Pahom hurriedly dug a hole, and turned straight towards the hillock.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\nPahom went straight towards the hillock, but he now walked with\ndifficulty. He was done up with the heat, his bare feet were cut and\nbruised, and his legs began to fail. He longed to rest, but it was\nimpossible if he meant to get back before sunset. The sun waits for no\nman, and it was sinking lower and lower.\n\n"Oh dear," he thought, "if only I have not blundered trying for too\nmuch! What if I am too late?"\n\nHe looked towards the hillock and at the sun. He was still far from his\ngoal, and the sun was already near the rim. Pahom walked on and on; it\nwas very hard walking, but he went quicker and quicker. He pressed on,\nbut was still far from the place. He began running, threw away his coat,\nhis boots, his flask, and his cap, and kept only the spade which he used\nas a support.\n\n"What shall I do," he thought again, "I have grasped too much, and\nruined the whole affair. I can\'t get there before the sun sets."\n\nAnd this fear made him still more breathless. Pahom went on running, his\nsoaking shirt and trousers stuck to him, and his mouth was parched. His\nbreast was working like a blacksmith\'s bellows, his heart was beating\nlike a hammer, and his legs were giving way as if they did not belong to\nhim. Pahom was seized with terror lest he should die of the strain.\n\nThough afraid of death, he could not stop. "After having run all that\nway they will call me a fool if I stop now," thought he. And he ran on\nand on, and drew near and heard the Bashkirs yelling and shouting to\nhim, and their cries inflamed his heart still more. He gathered his last\nstrength and ran on.\n\nThe sun was close to the rim, and cloaked in mist looked large, and red\nas blood. Now, yes now, it was about to set! The sun was quite low, but\nhe was also quite near his aim. Pahom could already see the people on\nthe hillock waving their arms to hurry him up. He could see the fox-fur\ncap on the ground, and the money on it, and the Chief sitting on the\nground holding his sides. And Pahom remembered his dream.\n\n"There is plenty of land," thought he, "but will God let me live on\nit? I have lost my life, I have lost my life! I shall never reach that\nspot!"\n\nPahom looked at the sun, which had reached the earth: one side of it\nhad already disappeared. With all his remaining strength he rushed\non, bending his body forward so that his legs could hardly follow fast\nenough to keep him from falling. Just as he reached the hillock it\nsuddenly grew dark. He looked up--the sun had already set. He gave a\ncry: "All my labor has been in vain," thought he, and was about to stop,\nbut he heard the Bashkirs still shouting, and remembered that though to\nhim, from below, the sun seemed to have set, they on the hillock could\nstill see it. He took a long breath and ran up the hillock. It was still\nlight there. He reached the top and saw the cap. Before it sat the Chief\nlaughing and holding his sides. Again Pahom remembered his dream, and\nhe uttered a cry: his legs gave way beneath him, he fell forward and\nreached the cap with his hands.\n\n"Ah, what a fine fellow!" exclaimed the Chief. "He has gained much\nland!"\n\nPahom\'s servant came running up and tried to raise him, but he saw that\nblood was flowing from his mouth. Pahom was dead!\n\nThe Bashkirs clicked their tongues to show their pity.\n\nHis servant picked up the spade and dug a grave long enough for Pahom\nto lie in, and buried him in it. Six feet from his head to his heels was\nall he needed.\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n1. One hundred kopeks make a rouble. The kopek is worth about half a\ncent.\n\n2. A non-intoxicating drink usually made from rye-malt and rye-flour.\n\n3. The brick oven in a Russian peasant\'s hut is usually built so as to\nleave a flat top, large enough to lie on, for those who want to sleep in\na warm place.\n\n4. 120 "desyatins."
