It is dark on board the ships; it has just struck eight bells.\n\nToward the north the activity of the day begins gradually to replace\nthe nocturnal quiet; here the relief guard has passed clanking their\narms, there the doctor is already hastening to the hospital, further on\nthe soldier has crept out of his earth hut and is washing his sunburnt\nface in ice-encrusted water, and, turning towards the crimsoning east,\ncrosses himself quickly as he prays to God; here a tall and heavy\ncamel-wagon has dragged creaking to the cemetery, to bury the bloody\ndead, with whom it is laden nearly to the top. You go to the wharf--a\npeculiar odor of coal, manure, dampness, and of beef strikes you;\nthousands of objects of all sorts--wood, meat, gabions, flour, iron, and\nso forth--lie in heaps about the wharf; soldiers of various regiments,\nwith knapsacks and muskets, without knapsacks and without muskets,\nthrong thither, smoke, quarrel, drag weights aboard the steamer which\nlies smoking beside the quay; unattached two-oared boats, filled with\nall sorts of people,--soldiers, sailors, merchants, women,--land at and\nleave the wharf.\n\n"To the Grafsky, Your Excellency? be so good." Two or three retired\nsailors rise in their boats and offer you their services.\n\nYou select the one who is nearest to you, you step over the\nhalf-decomposed carcass of a brown horse, which lies there in the mud\nbeside the boat, and reach the stern. You quit the shore. All about\nyou is the sea, already glittering in the morning sun, in front of you\nis an aged sailor, in a camel\'s-hair coat, and a young, white-headed\nboy, who work zealously and in silence at the oars. You gaze at the\nmotley vastness of the vessels, scattered far and near over the bay,\nand at the small black dots of boats moving about on the shining\nazure expanse, and at the bright and beautiful buildings of the city,\ntinted with the rosy rays of the morning sun, which are visible in one\ndirection, and at the foaming white line of the quay, and the sunken\nships from which black tips of masts rise sadly here and there, and\nat the distant fleet of the enemy faintly visible as they rock on the\ncrystal horizon of the sea, and at the streaks of foam on which leap\nsalt bubbles beaten up by the oars; you listen to the monotonous sound\nof voices which fly to you over the water, and the grand sounds of\nfiring, which, as it seems to you, is increasing in Sevastopol.\n\nIt cannot be that, at the thought that you too are in Sevastopol, a\ncertain feeling of manliness, of pride, has not penetrated your soul,\nand that the blood has not begun to flow more swiftly through your\nveins.\n\n"Your Excellency! you are steering straight into the Kistentin,"[A]\nsays your old sailor to you as he turns round to make sure of the\ndirection which you are imparting to the boat, with the rudder to the\nright.\n\n[A] The vessel Constantine.\n\n"And all the cannon are still on it," remarks the white-headed boy,\ncasting a glance over the ship as we pass.\n\n"Of course; it\'s new. Korniloff lived on board of it," said the old\nman, also glancing at the ship.\n\n"See where it has burst!" says the boy, after a long silence, looking\nat a white cloud of spreading smoke which has suddenly appeared high\nover the South Bay, accompanied by the sharp report of an exploding\nbomb.\n\n"_He_ is firing to-day with his new battery," adds the old man, calmly\nspitting on his hands. "Now, give way, Mishka! we\'ll overtake the\nbarge." And your boat moves forward more swiftly over the broad swells\nof the bay, and you actually do overtake the heavy barge, upon which\nsome bags are piled, and which is rowed by awkward soldiers, and it\ntouches the Grafsky wharf amid a multitude of boats of every sort which\nare landing.\n\nThrongs of gray soldiers, black sailors, and women of various colors\nmove noisily along the shore. The women are selling rolls, Russian\npeasants with samovars are crying _hot sbiten_;[B] and here upon the\nfirst steps are strewn rusted cannon-balls, bombs, grape-shot, and\ncast-iron cannon of various calibers; a little further on is a large\nsquare, upon which lie huge beams, gun-carriages, sleeping soldiers;\nthere stand horses, wagons, green guns, ammunition-chests, and stacks\nof arms; soldiers, sailors, officers, women, children, and merchants\nare moving about; carts are arriving with hay, bags, and casks; here\nand there Cossacks make their way through, or officers on horseback,\nor a general in a drosky. To the right, the street is hemmed in by a\nbarricade, in whose embrasures stand some small cannon, and beside\nthese sits a sailor smoking his pipe. On the left a handsome house\nwith Roman ciphers on the pediment, beneath which stand soldiers and\nblood-stained litters--everywhere you behold the unpleasant signs of\na war encampment. Your first impression is inevitably of the most\ndisagreeable sort. The strange mixture of camp and town life, of a\nbeautiful city and a dirty bivouac, is not only not beautiful, but\nseems repulsive disorder; it even seems to you that every one is\nthoroughly frightened, and is fussing about without knowing what he\nis doing. But look more closely at the faces of these people who are\nmoving about you, and you will gain an entirely different idea. Look at\nthis little soldier from the provinces, for example, who is leading a\ntroika of brown horses to water, and is purring something to himself so\ncomposedly that he evidently will not go astray in this motley crowd,\nwhich does not exist for him; but he is fulfilling his duty, whatever\nthat may be,--watering the horses or carrying arms,--with just as much\ncomposure, self-confidence, and equanimity as though it were taking\nplace in Tula or Saransk. You will read the same expression on the face\nof this officer who passes by in immaculate white gloves, and in the\nface of the sailor who is smoking as he sits on the barricade, and in\nthe faces of the working soldiers, waiting with their litters on the\nsteps of the former club, and in the face of yonder girl, who, fearing\nto wet her pink gown, skips across the street on the little stones.\n\n[B] A drink made of water, molasses, laurel-leaves or salvia, which is\ndrunk like tea, especially by the lower classes.\n\nYes! disenchantment certainly awaits you, if you are entering\nSevastopol for the first time. In vain will you seek, on even a\nsingle countenance, for traces of anxiety, discomposure, or even of\nenthusiasm, readiness for death, decision,--there is nothing of the\nsort. You will see the tradespeople quietly engaged in the duties\nof their callings, so that, possibly, you may reproach yourself for\nsuperfluous raptures, you may entertain some doubt as to the justice\nof the ideas regarding the heroism of the defenders of Sevastopol\nwhich you have formed from stories, descriptions, and the sights\nand sounds on the northern side. But, before you doubt, go upon the\nbastions, observe the defenders of Sevastopol on the very scene of\nthe defence, or, better still, go straight across into that house,\nwhich was formerly the Sevastopol Assembly House, and upon whose roof\nstand soldiers with litters,--there you will behold the defenders\nof Sevastopol, there you will behold frightful and sad, great and\nlaughable, but wonderful sights, which elevate the soul.\n\nYou enter the great Hall of Assembly. You have but just opened the door\nwhen the sight and smell of forty or fifty seriously wounded men and\nof those who have undergone amputation--some in hammocks, the majority\nupon the floor--suddenly strike you. Trust not to the feeling which\ndetains you upon the threshold of the hall; be not ashamed of having\ncome to _look at_ the sufferers, be not ashamed to approach and address\nthem: the unfortunates like to see a sympathizing human face, they like\nto tell of their sufferings and to hear words of love and interest. You\nwalk along between the beds and seek a face less stern and suffering,\nwhich you decide to approach, with the object of conversing.\n\n"Where are you wounded?" you inquire, timidly and with indecision, of\nan old, gaunt soldier, who, seated in his hammock, is watching you with\na good-natured glance, and seems to invite you to approach him. I say\n"you ask timidly," because these sufferings inspire you, over and above\nthe feeling of profound sympathy, with a fear of offending and with a\nlofty reverence for the man who has undergone them.\n\n"In the leg," replies the soldier; but, at the same time, you perceive,\nby the folds of the coverlet, that he has lost his leg above the knee.\n"God be thanked now," he adds,--"I shall get my discharge."\n\n"Were you wounded long ago?"\n\n"It was six weeks ago, Your Excellency."\n\n"Does it still pain you?"\n\n"No, there\'s no pain now; only there\'s a sort of gnawing in my calf\nwhen the weather is bad, but that\'s nothing."\n\n"How did you come to be wounded?"\n\n"On the fifth bastion, during the first bombardment. I had just trained\na cannon, and was on the point of going away, so, to another embrasure\nwhen _it_ struck me in the leg, just as if I had stepped into a hole\nand had no leg."\n\n"Was it not painful at the first moment?"\n\n"Not at all; only as though something boiling hot had struck my leg."\n\n"Well, and then?"\n\n"And then--nothing; only the skin began to draw as though it had been\nrubbed hard. The first thing of all, Your Excellency, _is not to think\nat all_. If you don\'t think about a thing, it amounts to nothing. Men\nsuffer from thinking more than from anything else."\n\nAt that moment, a woman in a gray striped dress and a black kerchief\nbound about her head approaches you.\n\nShe joins in your conversation with the sailor, and begins to tell\nabout him, about his sufferings, his desperate condition for the space\nof four weeks, and how, when he was wounded, he made the litter halt\nthat he might see the volley from our battery, how the grand-duke spoke\nto him and gave him twenty-five rubles, and how he said to him that he\nwanted to go back to the bastion to direct the younger men, even if he\ncould not work himself. As she says all this in a breath, the woman\nglances now at you, now at the sailor, who has turned away as though\nhe did not hear her and plucks some lint from his pillow, and her eyes\nsparkle with peculiar enthusiasm.\n\n"This is my housewife, Your Excellency!" the sailor says to you, with\nan expression which seems to say, "You must excuse her. Every one knows\nit\'s a woman\'s way--she\'s talking nonsense."\n\nYou begin to understand the defenders of Sevastopol. For some reason,\nyou feel ashamed of yourself in the presence of this man. You would\nlike to say a very great deal to him, in order to express to him your\nsympathy and admiration; but you find no words, or you are dissatisfied\nwith those which come into your head,--and you do reverence in silence\nbefore this taciturn, unconscious grandeur and firmness of soul, this\nmodesty in the face of his own merits.\n\n"Well, God grant you a speedy recovery," you say to him, and you halt\nbefore another invalid, who is lying on the floor and appears to be\nawaiting death in intolerable agony.\n\nHe is a blond man with pale, swollen face. He is lying on his back,\nwith his left arm thrown out, in a position which is expressive of\ncruel suffering. His parched, open mouth with difficulty emits his\nstertorous breathing; his blue, leaden eyes are rolled up, and from\nbeneath the wadded coverlet the remains of his right arm, enveloped\nin bandages, protrude. The oppressive odor of a corpse strikes you\nforcibly, and the consuming, internal fire which has penetrated every\nlimb of the sufferer seems to penetrate you also.\n\n"Is he unconscious?" you inquire of the woman, who comes up to you and\ngazes at you tenderly as at a relative.\n\n"No, he can still hear, but he\'s very bad," she adds, in a whisper. "I\ngave him some tea to-day,--what if he is a stranger, one must still have\npity!--and he hardly tasted it."\n\n"How do you feel?" you ask him.\n\nThe wounded man turns his eyeballs at the sound of your voice, but he\nneither sees nor understands you.\n\n"There\'s a gnawing at my heart."\n\nA little further on, you see an old soldier changing his linen. His\nface and body are of a sort of cinnamon-brown color, and gaunt as a\nskeleton. He has no arm at all; it has been cut off at the shoulder. He\nis sitting with a wide-awake air, he puts himself to rights; but you\nsee, by his dull, corpse-like gaze, his frightful gauntness, and the\nwrinkles on his face, that he is a being who has suffered for the best\npart of his life.\n\nOn the other side, you behold in a cot the pale, suffering, and\ndelicate face of a woman, upon whose cheek plays a feverish flush.\n\n"That\'s our little sailor lass who was struck in the leg by a bomb on\nthe 5th," your guide tells you. "She was carrying her husband\'s dinner\nto him in the bastion."\n\n"Has it been amputated?"\n\n"They cut it off above the knee."\n\nNow, if your nerves are strong, pass through the door on the left.\nIn yonder room they are applying bandages and performing operations.\nThere, you will see doctors with their arms blood-stained above the\nelbow, and with pale, stern faces, busied about a cot, upon which, with\neyes widely opened, and uttering, as in delirium, incoherent, sometimes\nsimple and touching words, lies a wounded man under the influence of\nchloroform. The doctors are busy with the repulsive but beneficent\nwork of amputation. You see the sharp, curved knife enter the healthy,\nwhite body, you see the wounded man suddenly regain consciousness with\na piercing cry and curses, you see the army surgeon fling the amputated\narm into a corner, you see another wounded man, lying in a litter in\nthe same apartment, shrink convulsively and groan as he gazes at the\noperation upon his comrade, not so much from physical pain as from the\nmoral torture of anticipation.--You behold the frightful, soul-stirring\nscenes; you behold war, not from its conventional, beautiful, and\nbrilliant side, with music and drum-beat, with fluttering flags and\ngalloping generals, but you behold war in its real phase--in blood, in\nsuffering, in death.\n\nOn emerging from this house of pain, you will infallibly experience\na sensation of pleasure, you will inhale the fresh air more fully,\nyou will feel satisfaction in the consciousness of your health, but,\nat the same time, you will draw from the sight of these sufferings a\nconsciousness of your nothingness, and you will go calmly and without\nany indecision to the bastion.\n\n"What do the death and sufferings of such an insignificant worm as I\nsignify in comparison with so many deaths and such great sufferings?"\nBut the sight of the clear sky, the brilliant sun, the fine city, the\nopen church, and the soldiers moving about in various directions soon\nrestores your mind to its normal condition of frivolity, petty cares,\nand absorption in the present alone.\n\nPerhaps you meet the funeral procession of some officer coming from the\nchurch, with rose-colored coffin, and music and fluttering banners;\nperhaps the sounds of firing reach your ear from the bastion, but this\ndoes not lead you back to your former thoughts; the funeral seems to\nyou a very fine military spectacle, and you do not connect with this\nspectacle, or with the sounds, any clear idea of suffering and death,\nas you did at the point where the bandaging was going on.\n\nPassing the barricade and the church, you come to the most lively part\nof the city. On both sides hang the signs of shops and inns. Merchants,\nwomen in bonnets and kerchiefs, dandified officers,--everything speaks\nto you of the firmness of spirit, of the independence and the security\nof the inhabitants.\n\nEnter the inn on the right if you wish to hear the conversations of\nsailors and officers; stories of the preceding night are sure to be in\nprogress there, and of Fenka, and the affair of the 24th, and of the\ndearness and badness of cutlets, and of such and such a comrade who has\nbeen killed.\n\n"Devil take it, how bad things are with us to-day!" ejaculates the bass\nvoice of a beardless naval officer, with white brows and lashes, in a\ngreen knitted sash.\n\n"Where?" asks another.\n\n"In the fourth bastion," replies the young officer, and you are\ncertain to look at the white-lashed officer with great attention, and\neven with some respect, at the words, "in the fourth bastion." His\nexcessive ease of manner, the way he flourishes his hands, his loud\nlaugh, and his voice, which seems to you insolent, reveal to you that\npeculiar boastful frame of mind which some very young men acquire\nafter danger; nevertheless, you think he is about to tell you how bad\nthe condition of things on the fourth bastion is because of the bombs\nand balls. Nothing of the sort! things are bad because it is muddy.\n"It\'s impossible to pass through the battery," says he, pointing at\nhis boots, which are covered with mud above the calf. "And my best\ngun-captain was killed to-day; he was struck plump in the forehead,"\nsays another. "Who\'s that? Mitiukhin?" "No!... What now, are they going\nto give me any veal? the villains!" he adds to the servant of the inn.\n"Not Mitiukhin, but Abrosimoff. Such a fine young fellow!--he was in the\nsixth sally."\n\nAt another corner of the table, over a dish of cutlets with peas, and\na bottle of sour Crimean wine called "Bordeaux," sit two infantry\nofficers; one with a red collar, who is young and has two stars on his\ncoat, is telling the other, with a black collar and no stars, about the\naffair at Alma. The former has already drunk a good deal, and it is\nevident, from the breaks in his narrative, from his undecided glance\nexpressive of doubt as to whether he is believed, and chiefly from\nthe altogether too prominent part which he has played in it all, and\nfrom the excessive horror of it all, that he is strongly disinclined\nto bear strict witness to the truth. But these tales, which you will\nhear for a long time to come in every corner of Russia, are nothing\nto you; you prefer to go to the bastions, especially to the fourth,\nof which you have heard so many and such diverse things. When any one\nsays that he has been in the fourth bastion, he says it with a peculiar\nair of pride and satisfaction; when any one says, "I am going to the\nfourth bastion," either a little agitation or a very great indifference\nis infallibly perceptible in him; when any one wants to jest about\nanother, he says, "You must be stationed in the fourth bastion;" when\nyou meet litters and inquire whence they come, the answer is generally,\n"From the fourth bastion." On the whole, two totally different opinions\nexist with regard to this terrible bastion; one is held by those who\nhave never been in it, and who are convinced that the fourth bastion is\na regular grave for every one who enters it, and the other by those\nwho live in it, like the white-lashed midshipman, and who, when they\nmention the fourth bastion, will tell you whether it is dry or muddy\nthere, whether it is warm or cold in the mud hut, and so forth.\n\nDuring the half-hour which you have passed in the inn, the weather has\nchanged; a fog which before spread over the sea has collected into\ndamp, heavy, gray clouds, and has veiled the sun; a kind of melancholy,\nfrozen mist sprinkles from above, and wets the roofs, the sidewalks,\nand the soldiers\' overcoats.\n\nPassing by yet another barricade, you emerge from the door at the right\nand ascend the principal street. Behind this barricade, the houses are\nunoccupied on both sides of the street, there are no signs, the doors\nare covered with boards, the windows are broken in; here the corners\nare broken away, there the roofs are pierced. The buildings seem to\nbe old, to have undergone every sort of vicissitude and deprivation\ncharacteristic of veterans, and appear to gaze proudly and somewhat\nscornfully upon you. You stumble over the cannon-balls which strew\nthe way, and into holes filled with water, which have been excavated\nin the stony ground by the bombs. In the street you meet and overtake\nbodies of soldiers, sharpshooters, officers; now and then you encounter\na woman or a child, but it is no longer a woman in a bonnet, but a\nsailor\'s daughter in an old fur cloak and soldier\'s boots. As you\nproceed along the street, and descend a small declivity, you observe\nthat there are no longer any houses about you, but only some strange\nheaps of ruined stones, boards, clay, and beams; ahead of you, upon a\nsteep hill, you perceive a black, muddy expanse, intersected by canals,\nand this that is in front is the fourth bastion. Here you meet still\nfewer people, no women are visible, the soldiers walk briskly, you come\nacross drops of blood on the road, and you will certainly encounter\nthere four soldiers with a stretcher and upon the stretcher a pale\nyellowish face and a blood-stained overcoat. If you inquire, "Where\nis he wounded?" the bearers will say angrily, without turning towards\nyou, "In the leg or the arm," if he is slightly wounded, or they will\npreserve a gloomy silence if no head is visible on the stretcher and he\nis already dead or badly hurt.\n\nThe shriek of a cannon-ball or a bomb close by surprises you\nunpleasantly, as you ascend the hill. You understand all at once,\nand quite differently from what you have before, the significance of\nthose sounds of shots which you heard in the city. A quietly cheerful\nmemory flashes suddenly before your fancy; your own personality begins\nto occupy you more than your observations; your attention to all\nthat surrounds you diminishes, and a certain disagreeable feeling of\nuncertainty suddenly overmasters you. In spite of this decidedly base\nvoice, which suddenly speaks within you, at the sight of danger, you\nforce it to be silent, especially when you glance at a soldier who\nruns laughing past you at a trot, waving his hands, and slipping down\nthe hill in the mud, and you involuntarily expand your chest, throw up\nyour head a little higher, and climb the slippery, clayey hill. As soon\nas you have reached the top, rifle-balls begin to whiz to the right\nand left of you, and, possibly, you begin to reflect whether you will\nnot go into the trench which runs parallel with the road; but this\ntrench is full of such yellow, liquid, foul-smelling mud, more than\nknee-deep, that you will infallibly choose the path on the hill, the\nmore so as you see that _every one uses the path_. After traversing a\ncouple of hundred paces, you emerge upon a muddy expanse, all ploughed\nup, and surrounded on all sides by gabions, earthworks, platforms,\nearth huts, upon which great cast-iron guns stand, and cannon-balls\nlie in symmetrical heaps. All these seem to be heaped up without any\naim, connection, or order. Here in the battery sit a knot of sailors;\nthere in the middle of the square, half buried in mud, lies a broken\ncannon; further on, a foot-soldier, with his gun, is marching through\nthe battery, and dragging his feet with difficulty through the sticky\nsoil. But everywhere, on all sides, in every spot, you see broken\ndishes, unexploded bombs, cannon-balls, signs of encampment, all sunk\nin the liquid, viscous mud. You seem to hear not far from you the thud\nof a cannon-ball; on all sides, you seem to hear the varied sounds\nof balls,--humming like bees, whistling sharply, or in a whine like a\ncord--you hear the frightful roar of the fusillade, which seems to shake\nyou all through with some horrible fright.\n\n"So this is it, the fourth bastion, this is it--that terrible, really\nfrightful place!" you think to yourself, and you experience a little\nsensation of pride, and a very large sensation of suppressed terror.\nBut you are mistaken, this is not the fourth bastion. It is the\nYazonovsky redoubt--a place which is comparatively safe; and not at all\ndreadful.\n\nIn order to reach the fourth bastion, you turn to the right, through\nthis narrow trench, through which the foot-soldier has gone. In this\ntrench you will perhaps meet stretchers again, sailors and soldiers\nwith shovels; you will see the superintendent of the mines, mud huts,\ninto which only two men can crawl by bending down, and there you will\nsee sharpshooters of the Black Sea battalions, who are changing their\nshoes, eating, smoking their pipes, and living; and you will still see\neverywhere that same stinking mud, traces of a camp, and cast-off iron\ndebris in every possible form. Proceeding yet three hundred paces,\nyou will emerge again upon a battery,--on an open space, all cut up\ninto holes and surrounded by gabions, covered with earth, cannon, and\nearthworks. Here you will perhaps see five sailors playing cards under\nthe shelter of the breastworks, and a naval officer who, perceiving\nthat you are a new-comer, and curious, will with pleasure show his\nhousehold arrangements, and everything which may be of interest to you.\n\nThis officer rolls himself a cigarette of yellow paper, with so much\ncomposure as he sits on a gun, walks so calmly from one embrasure\nto another, converses with you so quietly, without the slightest\naffectation, that, in spite of the bullets which hum above you\neven more thickly than before, you become cool yourself, question\nattentively, and listen to the officer\'s replies.\n\nThis officer will tell you, but only if you ask him, about the\nbombardment on the 5th, he will tell you how only one gun in his\nbattery could be used, and out of all the gunners who served it only\neight remained, and how, nevertheless, on the next morning, the 6th, he\nfired all the guns; he will tell you how a bomb fell upon a sailor\'s\nearth hut on the 5th, and laid low eleven men; he will point out to\nyou, from the embrasures, the enemy\'s batteries and entrenchments,\nwhich are not more than thirty or forty fathoms distant from this\npoint. I fear, however, that, under the influence of the whizzing\nbullets, you may thrust yourself out of the embrasure in order to view\nthe enemy; you will see nothing, and, if you do see anything, you will\nbe very much surprised that that white stone wall, which is so near you\nand from which white smoke rises in puffs,--that that white wall is the\nenemy--_he_, as the soldiers and sailors say.\n\nIt is even quite possible that the naval officer will want to discharge\na shot or two in your presence, out of vanity or simply for his own\npleasure. "Send the captain and his crew to the cannon;" and fourteen\nsailors step up briskly and merrily to the gun and load it--one\nthrusting his pipe into his pocket, another one chewing a biscuit,\nstill another clattering his heels on the platform.\n\nObserve the faces, the bearing, the movements of these men. In every\nwrinkle of that sunburned face, with its high cheek-bones, in every\nmuscle, in the breadth of those shoulders, in the stoutness of those\nlegs shod in huge boots, in every calm, firm, deliberate gesture,\nthese chief traits which constitute the power of Russia--simplicity\nand straightforwardness--are visible; but here, on every face, it\nseems to you that the danger, misery, and the sufferings of war\nhave, in addition to these principal characteristics, left traces of\nconsciousness of personal worth, emotion, and exalted thought.\n\nAll at once a frightful roar, which shakes not your organs of hearing\nalone but your whole being, startles you so that you tremble all over.\nThen you hear the distant shriek of the shot as it pursues its course,\nand the dense smoke of the powder conceals from you the platform and\nthe black figures of the sailors who are moving about upon it. You\nhear various remarks of the sailors in reference to this shot, and you\nsee their animation, and an exhibition of a feeling which you had not\nexpected to behold perhaps--a feeling of malice, of revenge against\nthe enemy, which lies hidden in the soul of each man. "It struck the\nembrasure itself; it seems to have killed two men--see, they\'ve carried\nthem off!" you hear in joyful exclamation. "And now they are angry;\nthey\'ll fire at us directly," says some one; and, in fact, shortly\nafter you see a flash in front and smoke; the sentry, who is standing\non the breastwork, shouts "Can-non!" And then the ball shrieks past\nyou, strikes the earth, and scatters a shower of dirt and stones about\nit.\n\nThis ball enrages the commander of the battery; he orders a second and\na third gun to be loaded, the enemy also begins to reply to us, and\nyou experience a sensation of interest, you hear and see interesting\nthings. Again the sentry shouts, "Can-non!" and you hear the same\nreport and blow, the same shower, or he shouts "Mortar!" and you hear\nthe monotonous, even rather pleasant whistle of the bomb, with which it\nis difficult to connect the thought of horror; you hear this whistle\napproaching you, and increasing in swiftness, then you see the black\nsphere, the impact on the ground, the resounding explosion of the bomb\nwhich can be felt. With the whistle and shriek, splinters fly again,\nstones whiz through the air, and mud showers over you. At these sounds\nyou experience a strange feeling of enjoyment, and, at the same time,\nof terror. At the moment when you know that the projectile is flying\ntowards you, it will infallibly occur to you that this shot will kill\nyou; but the feeling of self-love upholds you, and no one perceives\nthe knife which is cutting your heart. But when the shot has flown\npast without touching you, you grow animated, and a certain cheerful,\ninexpressibly pleasant feeling overpowers you, but only for a moment,\nso that you discover a peculiar sort of charm in danger, in this game\nof life and death, you want cannon-balls or bombs to strike nearer to\nyou.\n\nBut again the sentry has shouted in his loud, thick voice, "Mortar!"\nagain there is a shriek, and a bomb bursts, but with this noise comes\nthe groan of a man. You approach the wounded man, at the same moment\nwith the bearers; he has a strange, inhuman aspect, covered as he is\nwith blood and mud. A part of the sailor\'s breast has been torn away.\nDuring the first moments, there is visible on his mud-stained face\nonly fear and a certain simulated, premature expression of suffering,\npeculiar to men in that condition; but, at the same time, as the\nstretcher is brought to him and he is laid upon it on his sound side,\nyou observe that this expression is replaced by an expression of a\nsort of exaltation and lofty, inexpressible thought. His eyes shine\nmore brilliantly, his teeth are clenched, his head is held higher with\ndifficulty, and, as they lift him up, he stops the bearers and says\nto his comrades, with difficulty and in a trembling voice: "Farewell,\nbrothers!" He tries to say something more, and it is plain that he\nwants to say something touching, but he repeats once more: "Farewell,\nbrothers!"\n\nAt that moment, one of his fellow-sailors steps up to him, puts the cap\non the head which the wounded man holds towards him, and, waving his\nhand indifferently, returns calmly to his gun. "That\'s the way with\nseven or eight men every day," says the naval officer to you, in reply\nto the expression of horror which has appeared upon your countenance,\nas he yawns and rolls a cigarette of yellow paper.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThus you have seen the defenders of Sevastopol, on the very scene of\nthe defence, and you go back paying no attention, for some reason\nor other, to the cannon-balls and bullets, which continue to shriek\nthe whole way until you reach the ruined theatre,--you proceed with\ncomposure, and with your soul in a state of exaltation.\n\nThe principal and cheering conviction which you have brought away is\nthe conviction of the impossibility of the Russian people wavering\nanywhere whatever--and this impossibility you have discerned not in the\nmultitude of traverses, breastworks, artfully interlaced trenches,\nmines, and ordnance, piled one upon the other, of which you have\ncomprehended nothing; but you have discerned it in the eyes, the\nspeech, the manners, in what is called the spirit of the defenders\nof Sevastopol. What they are doing they do so simply, with so little\neffort and exertion, that you are convinced that they can do a hundred\ntimes more--that they can do anything. You understand that the feeling\nwhich makes them work is not a feeling of pettiness, ambition,\nforgetfulness, which you have yourself experienced, but a different\nsentiment, one more powerful, and one which has made of them men who\nlive with their ordinary composure under the fire of cannon, amid\nhundreds of chances of death, instead of the one to which all men are\nsubject who live under these conditions amid incessant labor, poverty,\nand dirt. Men will not accept these frightful conditions for the sake\nof a cross or a title, nor because of threats; there must be another\nlofty incentive as a cause, and this cause is the feeling which rarely\nappears, of which a Russian is ashamed, that which lies at the bottom\nof each man\'s soul--love for his country.\n\nOnly now have the tales of the early days of the siege of Sevastopol,\nwhen there were no fortifications there, no army, no physical\npossibility of holding it, and when at the same time there was not\nthe slightest doubt that it would not surrender to the enemy,--of the\ndays when that hero worthy of ancient Greece, Korniloff, said, as he\nreviewed the army: "We will die, children, but we will not surrender\nSevastopol;" and our Russians, who are not fitted to be phrase-makers,\nreplied: "We will die! hurrah!"--only now have tales of that time ceased\nto be for you the most beautiful historical legends, and have become\nreal facts and worthy of belief. You comprehend clearly, you figure\nto yourself, those men whom you have just seen, as the very heroes of\nthose grievous times, who have not fallen, but have been raised by the\nspirit, and have joyfully prepared for death, not for the sake of the\ncity, but of the country. This epos of Sevastopol, whose hero was the\nRussian people, will leave mighty traces in Russia for a long time to\ncome.\n\nNight is already falling. The sun has emerged from the gray clouds,\nwhich cover the sky just before its setting, and has suddenly\nilluminated with a crimson glow the purple vapors, the greenish sea\ncovered with ships and boats rocking on the regular swell, and the\nwhite buildings of the city, and the people who are moving through its\nstreets. Sounds of some old waltz played by the regimental band on the\nboulevard, and the sounds of firing from the bastions, which echo them\nstrangely, are borne across the water.\n\n\n\n\nSEVASTOPOL IN MAY, 1855.\n\n\nI.\n\nSix months have already passed since the first cannon-ball whistled\nfrom the bastions of Sevastopol, and ploughed the earth in the works\nof the enemy, and since that day thousands of bombs, cannon-balls, and\nrifle-balls have been flying incessantly from the bastions into the\ntrenches and from the trenches into the bastions, and the angel of\ndeath has never ceased to hover over them.\n\nThousands of men have been disappointed in satisfying their ambition;\nthousands have succeeded in satisfying theirs, in becoming swollen\nwith pride; thousands repose in the embrace of death. How many red\ncoffins and canvas canopies there have been! And still the same sounds\nare echoed from the bastions, and still on clear evenings the French\npeer from their camp, with involuntary tremor, at the yellow, furrowed\nbastions of Sevastopol, at the black forms of our sailors moving about\nupon them, and count the embrasures and the iron cannon which project\nangrily from them; the under officer still gazes through his telescope,\nfrom the heights of the telegraph station, at the dark figures of the\nFrench at their batteries, at their tents, at the columns moving over\nthe green hill, and at the puffs of smoke which issue forth from the\ntrenches,--and a crowd of men, formed of divers races, still streams in\nthrongs from various quarters, with the same ardor as ever, and with\ndesires differing even more greatly than their races, towards this\nfateful spot. And the question, unsolved by the diplomats, has still\nnot been solved by powder and blood.\n\n\nII.\n\nOn the boulevard of the besieged city of Sevastopol, not far from the\npavilion, the regimental band was playing, and throngs of military\nmen and of women moved gayly through the streets. The brilliant sun\nof spring had risen in the morning over the works of the English, had\npassed over the bastions, then over the city, over the Nikolaevsky\nbarracks, and, illuminating all with equal cheer, had now sunk into\nthe blue and distant sea, which was lighted with a silvery gleam as it\nheaved in peace.\n\nA tall, rather bent infantry officer, who was drawing upon his hand a\nglove which was presentable, if not entirely white, came out of one of\nthe small naval huts, built on the left side of the Morskaya[C] street,\nand, staring thoughtfully at the ground, took his way up the slope to\nthe boulevard.\n\n[C] Sea.\n\nThe expression of this officer\'s homely countenance did not indicate\nany great mental capacity, but rather simplicity, judgment, honor, and\na tendency to solid worth. He was badly built, not graceful, and he\nseemed to be constrained in his movements. He was dressed in a little\nworn cap, a cloak of a rather peculiar shade of lilac, from beneath\nwhose edge the gold of a watch-chain was visible; in trousers with\nstraps, and brilliantly polished calfskin boots. He must have been\neither a German--but his features clearly indicate his purely Russian\ndescent--or an adjutant, or a regimental quartermaster, only in that\ncase he would have had spurs, or an officer who had exchanged from the\ncavalry for the period of the campaign, or possibly from the Guards. He\nwas, in fact, an officer who had exchanged from the cavalry, and as he\nascended the boulevard, at the present moment, he was meditating upon a\nletter which he had just received from a former comrade, now a retired\nland-owner in the Government of T., and his wife, pale, blue-eyed\nNatasha, his great friend. He recalled one passage of the letter, in\nwhich his comrade said:--\n\n"When our _Invalid_[D] arrives, Pupka (this was the name by which the\nretired uhlan called his wife) rushes headlong into the vestibule,\nseizes the paper, and runs with it to the seat in the arbor, _in\nthe drawing-room_ (in which, if you remember, you and I passed such\ndelightful winter evenings when the regiment was stationed in our\ntown), and reads your heroic deeds with such ardor as it is impossible\nfor you to imagine. She often speaks of you. \'There is Mikhailoff,\' she\nsays, \'he\'s such a _love of a man_. I am ready to kiss him when I see\nhim. He fights on the bastions, and he will surely receive the Cross of\nSt. George, and he will be talked about in the newspapers ...\' and so\non, and so on ... so that I am really beginning to be jealous of you."\n\n[D] Military Gazette.\n\nIn another place he writes: "The papers reach us frightfully late,\nand, although there is plenty of news conveyed by word of mouth, not\nall of it can be trusted. For instance, the _young ladies with the\nmusic_, acquaintances of yours, were saying yesterday that Napoleon\nwas already captured by our Cossacks, and that he had been sent to\nPetersburg; but you will comprehend how much I believe of this.\nMoreover, a traveller from Petersburg told us (he has been sent on\nspecial business by the minister, is a very agreeable person, and, now\nthat there is no one in town, he is more of a _resource_ to us than\nyou can well imagine ...) well, he declares it to be a fact that our\ntroops have taken Eupatoria, _so that the French have no communication\nwhatever with Balaklava_, and that in this engagement two hundred of\nours were killed, but that the French lost fifteen thousand. My wife\nwas in such raptures over this that she _caroused_ all night, and she\ndeclares that her instinct tells her that you certainly took part in\nthat affair, and that you distinguished yourself."\n\nIn spite of these words, and of the expressions which I have purposely\nput in italics, and the whole tone of the letter, Staff-Captain\nMikhailoff recalled, with inexpressibly sad delight, his pale friend\nin the provinces, and how she had sat with him in the arbor in the\nevening, and talked about sentiment, and he thought of his good\ncomrade, the uhlan, and of how the latter had grown angry and had lost\nthe game when they had played cards for kopek stakes in his study, and\nhow the wife had laughed at them ... he recalled the friendship of\nthese two people for himself (perhaps it seemed to him to lie chiefly\non the side of his pale feminine friend); all these faces with their\nsurroundings flitted before his mind\'s eye, in a wonderfully sweet,\ncheerfully rosy light, and, smiling at his reminiscences, he placed his\nhand on the pocket which contained the letter so dear to him.\n\nFrom reminiscences Captain Mikhailoff involuntarily proceeded to dreams\nand hopes. "And what will be the joy and amazement of Natasha," he\nthought, as he paced along the narrow lane, "... when she suddenly\nreads in the _Invalid_ a description of how I was the first to climb\nupon the cannon, and that I have received the George! I shall certainly\nbe promoted to a full captaincy, by virtue of seniority. Then it is\nquite possible that I may get the grade of major in the line, this\nvery year, because many of our brothers have already been killed, and\nmany more will be in this campaign. And after that there will be more\naffairs on hand, and a regiment will be entrusted to me, since I am\nan experienced man ... lieutenant-colonel ... the Order of St. Anna\non my neck ... colonel!..." and he was already a general, granting an\ninterview to Natasha, the widow of his comrade, who, according to his\ndreams, would have died by that time, when the sounds of the music\non the boulevard penetrated more distinctly to his ears, the crowds\nof people caught his eye, and he found himself on the boulevard, a\nstaff-captain of infantry as before.\n\n\nIII.\n\nHe went, first of all, to the pavilion, near which were standing the\nmusicians, for whom other soldiers of the same regiment were holding\nthe notes, in the absence of stands, and about whom a ring of cadets,\nnurses, and children had formed, intent rather on seeing than on\nhearing. Around the pavilion stood, sat, or walked sailors, adjutants,\nand officers in white gloves. Along the grand avenue of the boulevard\npaced officers of every sort, and women of every description, rarely in\nbonnets, mostly with kerchiefs on their heads (some had neither bonnets\nnor kerchiefs), but no one was old, and it was worthy of note that all\nwere gay young creatures. Beyond, in the shady and fragrant alleys of\nwhite acacia, isolated groups walked and sat.\n\nNo one was especially delighted to encounter Captain Mikhailoff on\nthe boulevard, with the exception, possibly, of the captain of his\nregiment, Obzhogoff, and Captain Suslikoff, who pressed his hand\nwarmly; but the former was dressed in camel\'s-hair trousers, no\ngloves, a threadbare coat, and his face was very red and covered with\nperspiration, and the second shouted so loudly and incoherently that it\nwas mortifying to walk with them, particularly in the presence of the\nofficers in white gloves (with one of whom, an adjutant, Staff-Captain\nMikhailoff exchanged bows; and he might have bowed to another\nstaff-officer, since he had met him twice at the house of a mutual\nacquaintance). Besides, what pleasure was it to him to promenade with\nthese two gentlemen, Obzhogoff and Suslikoff, when he had met them and\nshaken hands with them six times that day already? It was not for this\nthat he had come.\n\nHe wanted to approach the adjutant with whom he had exchanged bows, and\nto enter into conversation with these officers, not for the sake of\nletting Captains Obzhogoff and Suslikoff and Lieutenant Pashtetzky see\nhim talking with them, but simply because they were agreeable people,\nand, what was more, they knew the news, and would have told it.\n\nBut why is Captain Mikhailoff afraid, and why cannot he make up his\nmind to approach them? "What if they should, all at once, refuse\nto recognize me," he thinks, "or, having bowed to me, what if they\ncontinue their conversation among themselves, as though I did not\nexist, or walk away from me entirely, and leave me standing there\nalone among the _aristocrats_." The word aristocrats (in the sense of\na higher, select circle, in any rank of life) has acquired for some\ntime past with us, in Russia, a great popularity, and has penetrated\ninto every locality and into every class of society whither vanity has\npenetrated--among merchants, among officials, writers, and officers, to\nSaratoff, to Mamaduish, to Vinnitz, everywhere where men exist.\n\nTo Captain Obzhogoff, Staff-Captain Mikhailoff was an _aristocrat_. To\nStaff-Captain Mikhailoff, Adjutant Kalugin was an _aristocrat_, because\nhe was an adjutant, and was on such a footing with the other adjutants\nas to call them "thou"! To Adjutant Kalugin, Count Nordoff was an\n_aristocrat_, because he was an adjutant on the Emperor\'s staff.\n\nVanity! vanity! and vanity everywhere, even on the brink of the grave,\nand among men ready to die for the highest convictions. Vanity! It\nmust be that it is a characteristic trait, and a peculiar malady of\nour century. Why was nothing ever heard among the men of former days,\nof this passion, any more than of the small-pox or the cholera? Why did\nHomer and Shakespeare talk of love, of glory, of suffering, while the\nliterature of our age is nothing but an endless narrative of snobs and\nvanity?\n\nThe staff-captain walked twice in indecision past the group of _his\naristocrats_, and the third time he exerted an effort over himself\nand went up to them. This group consisted of four officers: Adjutant\nKalugin, an acquaintance of Mikhailoff\'s, Adjutant Prince Galtsin,\nwho was something of an aristocrat even for Kalugin himself, Colonel\nNeferdoff, one of the so-called _hundred and twenty-two_ men of the\nworld (who had entered the service for this campaign, from the retired\nlist), and Captain of Cavalry Praskukhin, also one of the hundred and\ntwenty-two. Luckily for Mikhailoff, Kalugin was in a very fine humor\n(the general had just been talking to him in a very confidential way,\nand Prince Galtsin, who had just arrived from Petersburg, was stopping\nwith him); he did not consider it beneath his dignity to give his\nhand to Captain Mikhailoff, which Praskukhin, however, could not make\nup his mind to do, though he had met Mikhailoff very frequently on the\nbastion, had drunk the latter\'s wine and vodka, and was even indebted\nto him twenty rubles and a half at preference. As he did not yet know\nPrince Galtsin very well, he did not wish to convict himself, in the\nlatter\'s presence, of an acquaintance with a simple staff-captain of\ninfantry. He bowed slightly to the latter.\n\n"Well, Captain," said Kalugin, "when are we to go to the bastion again?\nDo you remember how we met each other on the Schvartz redoubt--it was\nhot there, hey?"\n\n"Yes, it was hot," said Mikhailoff, recalling how he had, that night,\nas he was making his way along the trenches to the bastion, encountered\nKalugin, who was walking along like a hero, valiantly clanking his\nsword. "I ought to have gone there to-morrow, according to present\narrangements; but we have a sick man," pursued Mikhailoff, "one\nofficer, as...."\n\nHe was about to relate how it was not his turn, but, as the commander\nof the eighth company was ill, and the company had only a cornet\nleft, he had regarded it as his duty to offer himself in the place\nof Lieutenant Nepshisetzky, and was, therefore, going to the bastion\nto-day. But Kalugin did not hear him out.\n\n"I have a feeling that something is going to happen within a few days,"\nhe said to Prince Galtsin.\n\n"And won\'t there be something to-day?" asked Mikhailoff, glancing first\nat Kalugin, then at Galtsin.\n\nNo one made him any reply. Prince Galtsin merely frowned a little, sent\nhis eyes past the other\'s cap, and, after maintaining silence for a\nmoment, said:--\n\n"That\'s a magnificent girl in the red kerchief. You don\'t know her, do\nyou, captain?"\n\n"She lives near my quarters; she is the daughter of a sailor," replied\nthe staff-captain.\n\n"Come on; let\'s have a good look at her."\n\nAnd Prince Galtsin linked one arm in that of Kalugin, the other in that\nof the staff-captain, being convinced in advance that he could afford\nthe latter no greater gratification, which was, in fact, quite true.\n\nThe staff-captain was superstitious, and considered it a great sin\nto occupy himself with women before a battle; but on this occasion he\nfeigned to be a vicious man, which Prince Galtsin and Kalugin evidently\ndid not believe, and which greatly amazed the girl in the red kerchief,\nwho had more than once observed how the staff-captain blushed as he\npassed her little window. Praskukhin walked behind, and kept touching\nPrince Galtsin with his hand, and making various remarks in the French\ntongue; but as a fourth person could not walk on the small path, he\nwas obliged to walk alone, and it was only on the second round that he\ntook the arm of the brave and well known naval officer _Servyagin_,\nwho had stepped up and spoken to him, and who was also desirous of\njoining the circle of _aristocrats_. And the gallant and famous beau\njoyfully thrust his honest and muscular hand through the elbow of a\nman who was known to all, and even well known to Servyagin, as not\ntoo nice. When Praskukhin, explaining to the prince his acquaintance\nwith _that sailor_, whispered to him that the latter was well known\nfor his bravery, Prince Galtsin, having been on the fourth bastion on\nthe previous evening, having seen a bomb burst twenty paces from him,\nconsidering himself no less a hero than this gentleman, and thinking\nthat many a reputation is acquired undeservedly, paid no particular\nattention to Servyagin.\n\nIt was so agreeable to Staff-Captain Mikhailoff to walk about in this\ncompany that he forgot the _dear_ letter from T----, and the gloomy\nthoughts which had assailed him in connection with his impending\ndeparture for the bastion. He remained with them until they began\nto talk exclusively among themselves, avoiding his glances, thereby\ngiving him to understand that he might go, and finally deserted him\nentirely. But the staff-captain was content, nevertheless, and as he\npassed Yunker[E] Baron Pesth, who had been particularly haughty and\nself-conceited since the preceding night, which was the first that he\nhad spent in the bomb-proof of the fifth bastion, and consequently\nconsidered himself a hero, he was not in the least offended at the\npresumptuous expression with which the yunker straightened himself up\nand doffed his hat before him.\n\n[E] A civilian, without military training, attached to a regiment as a\nnon-commissioned officer, who may eventually become a regular officer.\n\n\nIV.\n\nWhen later the staff-captain crossed the threshold of his quarters,\nentirely different thoughts entered his mind. He looked around his\nlittle chamber, with its uneven earth floor, and saw the windows all\nawry, pasted over with paper, his old bed, with a rug nailed over\nit, upon which was depicted a lady on horseback, and over which hung\ntwo Tula pistols, the dirty couch of a cadet who lived with him, and\nwhich was covered with a chintz coverlet; he saw his Nikita, who, with\nuntidy, tallowed hair, rose from the floor, scratching his head; he saw\nhis ancient cloak, his extra pair of boots, and a little bundle, from\nwhich peeped a bit of cheese and the neck of a porter bottle filled\nwith vodka, which had been prepared for his use on the bastion, and all\nat once he remembered that he was obliged to go with his company that\nnight to the fortifications.\n\n"It is certainly foreordained that I am to be killed to-night," thought\nthe captain.... "I feel it. And the principal point is that I need not\nhave gone, but that I offered myself. And the man who thrusts himself\nforward is always killed. And what\'s the matter with that accursed\nNepshisetsky? It is quite possible that he is not sick at all; and they\nwill kill another man for his sake, they will infallibly kill him.\nHowever, if they don\'t kill me, I shall be promoted probably. I saw how\ndelighted the regimental commander was when I asked him to allow me to\ngo, if Lieutenant Nepshisetsky was ill. If I don\'t turn out a major,\nthen I shall certainly get the Vladimir cross. This is the thirteenth\ntime that I have been to the bastion. Ah, the thirteenth is an unlucky\nnumber. They will surely kill me, I feel that I shall be killed; but\nsome one had to go, it was impossible for the lieutenant of the corps\nto go. And, whatever happens, the honor of the regiment, the honor of\nthe army, depends on it. It was my _duty_ to go ... yes, my sacred\nduty. But I have a foreboding."\n\nThe captain forgot that this was not the first time that a similar\nforeboding had assailed him, in a greater or less degree, when it had\nbeen necessary to go to the bastion, and he did not know that every\none who sets out on an affair experiences this foreboding with more or\nless force. Having calmed himself with this conception of duty, which\nwas especially and strongly developed in the staff-captain, he seated\nhimself at the table, and began to write a farewell letter to his\nfather. Ten minutes later, having finished his letter, he rose from the\ntable, his eyes wet with tears, and, mentally reciting all the prayers\nhe knew, he set about dressing. His coarse, drunken servant indolently\nhanded him his new coat (the old one, which the captain generally wore\nwhen going to the bastion, was not mended).\n\n"Why is not my coat mended? You never do anything but sleep, you\ngood-for-nothing!" said Mikhailoff, angrily.\n\n"Sleep!" grumbled Nikita. "You run like a dog all day long; perhaps you\nstop--but you must not sleep, even then!"\n\n"You are drunk again, I see."\n\n"I didn\'t get drunk on your money, so you needn\'t scold."\n\n"Hold your tongue, blockhead!" shouted the captain, who was ready to\nstrike the man. He had been absent-minded at first, but now he was, at\nlast, out of patience, and embittered by the rudeness of Nikita, whom\nhe loved, even spoiled, and who had lived with him for twelve years.\n\n"Blockhead? Blockhead?" repeated the servant. "Why do you call me a\nblockhead, sir? Is this a time for that sort of thing? It is not good\nto curse."\n\nMikhailoff recalled whither he was on the point of going, and felt\nashamed of himself.\n\n"You are enough to put a saint out of patience, Nikita," he said, in a\ngentle voice. "Leave that letter to my father on the table, and don\'t\ntouch it," he added, turning red.\n\n"Yes, sir," said Nikita, melting under the influence of the wine which\nhe had drunk, as he had said, "at his own expense," and winking his\neyes with a visible desire to weep.\n\nBut when the captain said: "Good-by, Nikita," on the porch, Nikita\nsuddenly broke down into repressed sobs, and ran to kiss his master\'s\nhand.... "Farewell, master!" he exclaimed, sobbing. The old sailor\'s\nwife, who was standing on the porch, could not, in her capacity of a\nwoman, refrain from joining in this touching scene, so she began to\nwipe her eyes with her dirty sleeve, and to say something about even\ngentlemen having their trials to bear, and that she, poor creature, had\nbeen left a widow. And she related for the hundredth time to drunken\nNikita the story of her woes; how her husband had been killed in the\nfirst bombardment, and how her little house had been utterly ruined\n(the one in which she was now living did not belong to her), and so on.\nWhen his master had departed, Nikita lighted his pipe, requested the\ndaughter of their landlord to go for some vodka, and very soon ceased\nto weep, but, on the contrary, got into a quarrel with the old woman\nabout some small bucket, which, he declared, she had broken.\n\n"But perhaps I shall only be wounded," meditated the captain, as he\nmarched through the twilight to the bastion with his company. "But\nwhere? How? Here or here?" he thought, indicating his belly and his\nbreast.... "If it should be here (he thought of the upper portion of\nhis leg), it might run round. Well, but if it were here, and by a\nsplinter, that would finish me."\n\nThe captain reached the fortifications safely through the trenches,\nset his men to work, with the assistance of an officer of sappers, in\nthe darkness, which was complete, and seated himself in a pit behind\nthe breastworks. There was not much firing; only once in a while\nthe lightning flashed from our batteries, then from _his_, and the\nbrilliant fuse of a bomb traced an arc of flame against the dark,\nstarry heavens. But all the bombs fell far in the rear and to the right\nof the rifle-pits in which the captain sat. He drank his vodka, ate his\ncheese, lit his cigarette, and, after saying his prayers, he tried to\nget a little sleep.\n\n\nV.\n\nPrince Galtsin, Lieutenant-Colonel Neferdoff, and Praskukhin, whom no\none had invited, to whom no one spoke, but who never left them, all\nwent to drink tea with Adjutant Kalugin.\n\n"Well, you did not finish telling me about Vaska Mendel," said\nKalugin, as he took off his cloak, seated himself by the window in a\nsoft lounging-chair, and unbuttoned the collar of his fresh, stiffly\nstarched cambric shirt: "How did he come to marry?"\n\n"That\'s a joke, my dear fellow! There was a time, I assure you, when\nnothing else was talked of in Petersburg," said Prince Galtsin, with a\nlaugh, as he sprang up from the piano, and seated himself on the window\nbeside Kalugin. "It is simply ludicrous, and I know all the details of\nthe affair."\n\nAnd he began to relate--in a merry, and skilful manner--a love story,\nwhich we will omit, because it possesses no interest for us. But it\nis worthy of note that not only Prince Galtsin, but all the gentlemen\nwho had placed themselves here, one on the window-sill, another with\nhis legs coiled up under him, a third at the piano, seemed totally\ndifferent persons from what they were when on the boulevard; there was\nnothing of that absurd arrogance and haughtiness which they and their\nkind exhibit in public to the infantry officers; here they were among\ntheir own set and natural, especially Kalugin and Prince Galtsin, and\nwere like very good, amiable, and merry children. The conversation\nturned on their companions in the service in Petersburg, and on their\nacquaintances.\n\n"What of Maslovsky?"\n\n"Which? the uhlan of the body-guard or of the horse-guard?"\n\n"I know both of them. The one in the horse-guards was with me when he\nwas a little boy, and had only just left school. What is the elder one?\na captain of cavalry?"\n\n"Oh, yes! long ago."\n\n"And is he still going about with his gypsy maid?"\n\n"No, he has deserted her ..." and so forth, and so forth, in the same\nstrain.\n\nThen Prince Galtsin seated himself at the piano, and sang a gypsy song\nin magnificent style. Praskukhin began to sing second, although no\none had asked him, and he did it so well that they requested him to\naccompany the prince again, which he gladly consented to do.\n\nThe servant came in with the tea, cream, and cracknels on a silver\nsalver.\n\n"Serve the prince," said Kalugin.\n\n"Really, it is strange to think," said Galtsin, taking a glass, and\nwalking to the window, "that we are in a beleaguered city; tea with\ncream, and such quarters as I should be only too happy to get in\nPetersburg."\n\n"Yes, if it were not for that," said the old lieutenant-colonel, who\nwas dissatisfied with everything, "this constant waiting for something\nwould be simply unendurable ... and to see how men are killed, killed\nevery day,--and there is no end to it, and under such circumstances it\nwould not be comfortable to live in the mud."\n\n"And how about our infantry officers?" said Kalugin. "They live in the\nbastions with the soldiers in the casemates and eat beet soup with the\nsoldiers--how about them?"\n\n"How about them? They don\'t change their linen for ten days at a time,\nand they are heroes--wonderful men."\n\nAt this moment an officer of infantry entered the room.\n\n"I ... I was ordered ... may I present myself to the gen ... to His\nExcellency from General N.?" he inquired, bowing with an air of\nembarrassment.\n\nKalugin rose, but, without returning the officer\'s salute, he asked\nhim, with insulting courtesy and strained official smile, whether\n_they_[F] would not wait awhile; and, without inviting him to be seated\nor paying any further attention to him, he turned to Prince Galtsin\nand began to speak to him in French, so that the unhappy officer, who\nremained standing in the middle of the room, absolutely did not know\nwhat to do with himself.\n\n[F] A polite way of referring to the general in the plural.\n\n"It is on very important business, sir," said the officer, after a\nmomentary pause.\n\n"Ah! very well, then," said Kalugin, putting on his cloak, and\naccompanying him to the door.\n\n"_Eh bien, messieurs_, I think there will be hot work to-night," said\nKalugin in French, on his return from the general\'s.\n\n"Hey? What? A sortie?" They all began to question him.\n\n"I don\'t know yet--you will see for yourselves," replied Kalugin, with a\nmysterious smile.\n\n"And my commander is on the bastion--of course, I shall have to go,"\nsaid Praskukhin, buckling on his sword.\n\nBut no one answered him: he must know for himself whether he had to go\nor not.\n\nPraskukhin and Neferdoff went off, in order to betake themselves to\ntheir posts. "Farewell, gentlemen!" "Au revoir, gentlemen! We shall\nmeet again to-night!" shouted Kalugin from the window when Praskukhin\nand Neferdoff trotted down the street, bending over the bows of their\nCossack saddles. The trampling of their Cossack horses soon died away\nin the dusky street.\n\n"No, tell me, is something really going to take place to-night?" said\nGaltsin, in French, as he leaned with Kalugin on the window-sill, and\ngazed at the bombs which were flying over the bastions.\n\n"I can tell you, you see ... you have been on the bastions, of course?"\n(Galtsin made a sign of assent, although he had been only once to the\nfourth bastion.) "Well, there was a trench opposite our lunette",\nand Kalugin, who was not a specialist, although he considered his\njudgment on military affairs particularly accurate, began to explain\nthe position of our troops and of the enemy\'s works and the plan of the\nproposed affair, mixing up the technical terms of fortifications a good\ndeal in the process.\n\n"But they are beginning to hammer away at our casemates. Oho! was that\nours or _his_? there, it has burst," they said, as they leaned on the\nwindow-sill, gazing at the fiery line of the bomb, which exploded in\nthe air, at the lightning of the discharges, at the dark blue sky,\nmomentarily illuminated, and at the white smoke of the powder, and\nlistened to the sounds of the firing, which grew louder and louder.\n\n"What a charming sight? is it not?" said Kalugin, in French, directing\nthe attention of his guest to the really beautiful spectacle. "Do you\nknow, you cannot distinguish the stars from the bombs at times."\n\n"Yes, I was just thinking that that was a star; but it darted down ...\nthere, it has burst now. And that big star yonder, what is it called?\nIt is just exactly like a bomb."\n\n"Do you know, I have grown so used to these bombs that I am convinced\nthat a starlight night in Russia will always seem to me to be all\nbombs; one gets so accustomed to them."\n\n"But am not I to go on this sortie?" inquired Galtsin, after a\nmomentary silence.\n\n"Enough of that, brother! Don\'t think of such a thing! I won\'t let you\ngo!" replied Kalugin. "Your turn will come, brother!"\n\n"Seriously? So you think that it is not necessary to go? Hey?..."\n\nAt that moment, a frightful crash of rifles was heard in the direction\nin which these gentlemen were looking, above the roar of the cannon,\nand thousands of small fires, flaring up incessantly, without\nintermission, flashed along the entire line.\n\n"That\'s it, when the real work has begun!" said Kalugin.--"That is the\nsound of the rifles, and I cannot hear it in cold blood; it takes a\nsort of hold on your soul, you know. And there is the hurrah!" he\nadded, listening to the prolonged and distant roar of hundreds of\nvoices, "A-a-aa!" which reached him from the bastion.\n\n"What is this hurrah, theirs or ours?"\n\n"I don\'t know; but it has come to a hand-to-hand fight, for the firing\nhas ceased."\n\nAt that moment, an officer followed by his Cossack galloped up to the\nporch, and slipped down from his horse.\n\n"Where from?"\n\n"From the bastion. The general is wanted."\n\n"Let us go. Well, now, what is it?"\n\n"They have attacked the lodgements ... have taken them ... the French\nhave brought up their heavy reserves ... they have attacked our forces\n... there were only two battalions," said the panting officer, who\nwas the same that had come in the evening, drawing his breath with\ndifficulty, but stepping to the door with perfect unconcern.\n\n"Well, have they retreated?" inquired Galtsin.\n\n"No," answered the officer, angrily. "The battalion came up and beat\nthem back; but the commander of the regiment is killed, and many\nofficers, and I have been ordered to ask for re-enforcements...."\n\nAnd with these words he and Kalugin went off to the general, whither we\nwill not follow them.\n\nFive minutes later, Kalugin was mounted on the Cossack\'s horse (and\nwith that peculiar, _quasi_-Cossack seat, in which, as I have observed,\nall adjutants find something especially captivating, for some reason\nor other), and rode at a trot to the bastion, in order to give some\norders, and to await the news of the final result of the affair. And\nPrince Galtsin, under the influence of that oppressive emotion which\nthe signs of a battle near at hand usually produce on a spectator who\ntakes no part in it, went out into the street, and began to pace up and\ndown there without any object.\n\n\nVI.\n\nThe soldiers were bearing the wounded on stretchers, and supporting\nthem by their arms. It was completely dark in the streets; now and\nthen, a rare light flashed in the hospital or from the spot where\nthe officers were seated. The same thunder of cannon and exchange of\nrifle-shots was borne from the bastions, and the same fires flashed\nagainst the dark heavens. Now and then, you could hear the trampling\nhoofs of an orderly\'s horse, the groan of a wounded man, the footsteps\nand voices of the stretcher-bearers, or the conversation of some of the\nfrightened female inhabitants, who had come out on their porches to\nview the cannonade.\n\nAmong the latter were our acquaintances Nikita, the old sailor\'s widow,\nwith whom he had already made his peace, and her ten-year-old daughter.\n"Lord, Most Holy Mother of God!" whispered the old woman to herself\nwith a sigh, as she watched the bombs, which, like balls of fire,\nsailed incessantly from one side to the other. "What a shame, what a\nshame! I-i-hi-hi! It was not so in the first bombardment. See, there it\nhas burst, the cursed thing! right above our house in the suburbs."\n\n"No, it is farther off, in aunt Arinka\'s garden, that they all fall,"\nsaid the little girl.\n\n"And where, where is my master now!" said Nikita, with a drawl, for he\nwas still rather drunk. "Oh, how I love that master of mine!--I don\'t\nknow myself!--I love him so that if, which God forbid, they should\nkill him in this sinful fight, then, if you will believe it, aunty, I\ndon\'t know myself what I might do to myself in that case--by Heavens, I\ndon\'t! He is such a master that words will not do him justice! Would\nI exchange him for one of those who play cards? That is simply--whew!\nthat\'s all there is to say!" concluded Nikita, pointing at the lighted\nwindow of his master\'s room, in which, as the staff-captain was\nabsent, Yunker Zhvadchevsky had invited his friends to a carouse, on\nthe occasion of his receiving the cross: Sub-Lieutenant Ugrovitch and\nSub-Lieutenant Nepshisetsky, who was ill with a cold in the head.\n\n"Those little stars! They dart through the sky like stars, like stars!"\nsaid the little girl, breaking the silence which succeeded Nikita\'s\nwords. "There, there! another has dropped! Why do they do it, mamma?"\n\n"They will ruin our little cabin entirely," said the old woman,\nsighing, and not replying to her little daughter\'s question.\n\n"And when uncle and I went there to-day, mamma," continued the little\ngirl, in a shrill voice, "there was such a big cannon-ball lying in the\nroom, near the cupboard; it had broken through the wall and into the\nroom ... and it is so big that you couldn\'t lift it."\n\n"Those who had husbands and money have gone away," said the old woman,\n"and now they have ruined my last little house. See, see how they are\nfiring, the wretches. Lord, Lord!"\n\n"And as soon as we came out, a bomb flew at us, and burst and scattered\nthe earth about, and a piece of the shell came near striking uncle and\nme."\n\n\nVII.\n\nPrince Galtsin met more and more wounded men, in stretchers and on\nfoot, supporting each other, and talking loudly.\n\n"When they rushed up, brothers," said one tall soldier, who had two\nguns on his shoulder, in a bass voice, "when they rushed up and\nshouted, \'Allah, Allah!\'[G] they pressed each other on. You kill one,\nand another takes his place--you can do nothing. You never saw such\nnumbers as there were of them...."\n\n[G] A The Russian soldiers, who had been fighting the Turks, were so\naccustomed to this cry of the enemy that they always declared that the\nFrench also cried "Allah."--AUTHOR\'S NOTE.\n\nBut at this point in his story Galtsin interrupted him.\n\n"You come from the bastion?"\n\n"Just so, Your Honor!"\n\n"Well, what has been going on there? Tell me."\n\n"Why, what has been going on? They attacked in force, Your Honor;\nthey climbed over the wall, and that\'s the end of it. They conquered\ncompletely, Your Honor."\n\n"How conquered? You repulsed them, surely?"\n\n"How could we repulse them, when he came up with his whole force? They\nkilled all our men, and there was no help given us."\n\nThe soldier was mistaken, for the trenches were behind our forces; but\nthis is a peculiar thing, which any one may observe: a soldier who has\nbeen wounded in an engagement always thinks that the day has been lost,\nand that the encounter has been a frightfully bloody one.\n\n"Then, what did they mean by telling me that you had repulsed them?"\nsaid Galtsin, with irritation. "Perhaps the enemy was repulsed after\nyou left? Is it long since you came away?"\n\n"I have this instant come from there, Your Honor," replied the soldier.\n"It is hardly possible. The trenches remained in his hands ... he won a\ncomplete victory."\n\n"Well, and are you not ashamed to have surrendered the trenches? This\nis horrible!" said Galtsin, angered by such indifference.\n\n"What, when he was there in force?" growled the soldier.\n\n"And, Your Honor," said a soldier on a stretcher, who had just come up\nwith them, "how could we help surrendering, when nearly all of us had\nbeen killed? If we had been in force, we would only have surrendered\nwith our lives. But what was there to do? I ran one man through, and\nthen I was struck.... O-oh! softly, brothers! steady, brothers! go more\nsteadily!... O-oh!" groaned the wounded man.\n\n"There really seem to be a great many extra men coming this way," said\nGaltsin, again stopping the tall soldier with the two rifles. "Why are\nyou walking off? Hey there, halt!"\n\nThe soldier halted, and removed his cap with his left hand.\n\n"Where are you going, and why?" he shouted at him sternly. "He ..."\n\nBut, approaching the soldier very closely at that moment, he perceived\nthat the latter\'s right arm was bandaged, and covered with blood far\nabove the elbow.\n\n"I am wounded, Your Honor!"\n\n"Wounded? how?"\n\n"It must have been a bullet, here!" said the soldier, pointing at his\narm, "but I cannot tell yet. My head has been broken by something,"\nand, bending over, he showed the hair upon the back of it all clotted\ntogether with blood.\n\n"And whose gun is that second one you have?"\n\n"A choice French one, Your Honor! I captured it. And I should not have\ncome away if it had not been to accompany this soldier; he might fall\ndown," he added, pointing at the soldier, who was walking a little in\nfront, leaning upon his gun, and dragging his left foot heavily after\nhim.\n\nPrince Galtsin all at once became frightfully ashamed of his unjust\nsuspicions. He felt that he was growing crimson, and turned away,\nwithout questioning the wounded men further, and, without looking after\nthem, he went to the place where the injured men were being cared for.\n\nHaving forced his way with difficulty to the porch, through the wounded\nmen who had come on foot, and the stretcher-bearers, who were entering\nwith the wounded and emerging with the dead, Galtsin entered the first\nroom, glanced round, and involuntarily turned back, and immediately ran\ninto the street. It was too terrible.\n\n\nVIII.\n\nThe vast, dark, lofty hall, lighted only by the four or five candles,\nwhich the doctors were carrying about to inspect the wounded, was\nliterally full. The stretcher-bearers brought in the wounded, ranged\nthem one beside another on the floor, which was already so crowded that\nthe unfortunate wretches hustled each other and sprinkled each other\nwith their blood, and then went forth for more. The pools of blood\nwhich were visible on the unoccupied places, the hot breaths of several\nhundred men, and the steam which rose from those who were toiling\nwith the stretchers produced a peculiar, thick, heavy, offensive\natmosphere, in which the candles burned dimly in the different parts\nof the room. The dull murmur of diverse groans, sighs, death-rattles,\nbroken now and again by a shriek, was borne throughout the apartment.\nSisters of charity, with tranquil faces, and with an expression not of\nempty, feminine, tearfully sickly compassion, but of active, practical\nsympathy, flitted hither and thither among the blood-stained cloaks and\nshirts, stepping over the wounded, with medicine, water, bandages, lint.\n\nDoctors, with their sleeves rolled up, knelt beside the wounded, beside\nwhom the assistant surgeons held the candles, inspecting, feeling, and\nprobing the wounds, in spite of the terrible groans and entreaties of\nthe sufferers. One of the doctors was seated at a small table by the\ndoor, and, at the moment when Galtsin entered the room, he was just\nwriting down "No. 532."\n\n"Ivan Bogaeff, common soldier, third company of the S---- regiment,\n_fractura femoris complicata_!" called another from the extremity of\nthe hall, as he felt of the crushed leg.... "Turn him over."\n\n"O-oi, my fathers, good fathers!" shrieked the soldier, beseeching them\nnot to touch him.\n\n"_Perforatio capitis._"\n\n"Semyon Neferdoff, lieutenant-colonel of the N---- regiment of infantry.\nHave a little patience, colonel: you can only be attended to this way;\nI will let you alone," said a third, picking away at the head of the\nunfortunate colonel, with some sort of a hook.\n\n"Ai! stop! Oi! for God\'s sake, quick, quick, for the sake a-a-a-a!..."\n\n"_Perforatio pectoris_ ... Sevastyan Sereda, common soldier ... of what\nregiment? however, you need not write that: _moritur_. Carry him away,"\nsaid the doctor, abandoning the soldier, who was rolling his eyes, and\nalready emitting the death-rattle.\n\nForty stretcher-bearers stood at the door, awaiting the task of\ntransporting to the hospital the men who had been attended to, and the\ndead to the chapel, and gazed at this picture in silence, only uttering\na heavy sigh from time to time....\n\n\nIX.\n\nOn his way to the bastion, Kalugin met numerous wounded men; but,\nknowing from experience that such a spectacle has a bad effect on the\nspirits of a man on the verge of an action, he not only did not pause\nto interrogate them, but, on the contrary, he tried not to pay any heed\nto them. At the foot of the hill he encountered an orderly, who was\ngalloping from the bastion at full speed.\n\n"Zobkin! Zobkin! Stop a minute!"\n\n"Well, what is it?"\n\n"Where are you from?"\n\n"From the lodgements."\n\n"Well, how are things there! Hot?"\n\n"Ah, frightfully!"\n\nAnd the orderly galloped on.\n\nIn fact, although there was not much firing from the rifles, the\ncannonade had begun with fresh vigor and greater heat than ever.\n\n"Ah, that\'s bad!" thought Kalugin, experiencing a rather unpleasant\nsensation, and there came to him also a presentiment, that is to say, a\nvery usual thought--the thought of death.\n\nBut Kalugin was an egotist and gifted with nerves of steel; in a word,\nhe was what is called brave. He did not yield to his first sensation,\nand began to arouse his courage; he recalled to mind a certain adjutant\nof Napoleon, who, after having given the command to advance, galloped\nup to Napoleon, his head all covered with blood.\n\n"You are wounded?" said Napoleon to him. "I beg your pardon, Sire, I am\ndead,"--and the adjutant fell from his horse, and died on the spot.\n\nThis seemed very fine to him, and he fancied that he somewhat resembled\nthis adjutant; then he gave his horse a blow with the whip; and assumed\nstill more of that knowing Cossack bearing, glanced at his orderly, who\nwas galloping behind him, standing upright in his stirrups, and thus in\ndashing style he reached the place where it was necessary to dismount.\nHere he found four soldiers, who were smoking their pipes as they sat\non the stones.\n\n"What are you doing here?" he shouted at them.\n\n"We have been carrying a wounded man from the field, Your Honor, and\nhave sat down to rest," one of them replied, concealing his pipe behind\nhis back, and pulling off his cap.\n\n"Resting indeed! March off to your posts!"\n\nAnd, in company with them, he walked up the hill through the trenches,\nencountering wounded men at every step.\n\nOn attaining the crest of the hill, he turned to the left, and, after\ntaking a few steps, found himself quite alone. Splinters whizzed near\nhim, and struck in the trenches. Another bomb rose in front of him, and\nseemed to be flying straight at him. All of a sudden he felt terrified;\nhe ran off five paces at full speed, and lay down on the ground. But\nwhen the bomb burst, and at a distance from him, he grew dreadfully\nvexed at himself, and glanced about as he rose, to see whether any one\nhad perceived him fall, but there was no one about.\n\nWhen fear has once made its way into the mind, it does not speedily\ngive way to another feeling. He, who had boasted that he would\nnever bend, hastened along the trench with accelerated speed, and\nalmost on his hands and knees. "Ah! this is very bad!" he thought,\nas he stumbled. "I shall certainly be killed!" And, conscious of how\ndifficult it was for him to breathe, and that the perspiration was\nbreaking out all over his body, he was amazed at himself, but he no\nlonger strove to conquer his feelings.\n\nAll at once steps became audible in advance of him. He quickly\nstraightened himself up, raised his head, and, boldly clanking his\nsword, began to proceed at a slower pace than before. He did not know\nhimself. When he joined the officer of sappers and the sailor who\nwere coming to meet him, and the former called to him, "Lie down,"\npointing to the bright speck of a bomb, which, growing ever brighter\nand brighter, swifter and swifter, as it approached, crashed down\nin the vicinity of the trench, he only bent his head a very little,\ninvoluntarily, under the influence of the terrified shout, and went his\nway.\n\n"Whew! what a brave man!" ejaculated the sailor, who had calmly watched\nthe exploding bomb, and, with practised glance, at once calculated\nthat its splinters could not strike inside the trench; "he did not even\nwish to lie down."\n\nOnly a few steps remained to be taken, across an open space, before\nKalugin would reach the casemate of the commander of the bastion, when\nhe was again attacked by dimness of vision and that stupid sensation of\nfear; his heart began to beat more violently, the blood rushed to his\nhead, and he was obliged to exert an effort over himself in order to\nreach the casemate.\n\n"Why are you so out of breath?" inquired the general, when Kalugin had\ncommunicated to him his orders.\n\n"I have been walking very fast, Your Excellency!"\n\n"Will you not take a glass of wine?"\n\nKalugin drank the wine, and lighted a cigarette. The engagement had\nalready come to an end; only the heavy cannonade continued, going on\nfrom both sides.\n\nIn the casemate sat General N., the commander of the bastion, and six\nother officers, among whom was Praskukhin, discussing various details\nof the conflict. Seated in this comfortable apartment, with blue\nhangings, with a sofa, a bed, a table, covered with papers, a wall\nclock, and the holy pictures, before which burned a lamp, and gazing\nupon these signs of habitation, and at the arshin-thick (twenty-eight\ninches) beams which formed the ceiling, and listening to the shots,\nwhich were deadened by the casemate, Kalugin positively could not\nunderstand how he had twice permitted himself to be overcome with such\nunpardonable weakness. He was angry with himself, and he longed for\ndanger, in order that he might subject himself to another trial.\n\n"I am glad that you are here, captain," he said to a naval officer,\nin the cloak of staff-officer, with a large moustache and the cross\nof St. George, who entered the casemate at that moment, and asked the\ngeneral to give him some men, that he might repair the two embrasures\non his battery, which had been demolished. "The general ordered me to\ninquire," continued Kalugin, when the commander of the battery ceased\nto address the general, "whether your guns can fire grape-shot into\nthe trenches."\n\n"Only one of my guns will do that," replied the captain, gruffly.\n\n"Let us go and see, all the same."\n\nThe captain frowned, and grunted angrily:--\n\n"I have already passed the whole night there, and I came here to try\nand get a little rest," said he. "Cannot you go alone? My assistant,\nLieutenant Kartz, is there, and he will show you everything."\n\nThe captain had now been for six months in command of this, one of the\nmost dangerous of the batteries--and even when there were no casemates\nhe had lived, without relief, in the bastion and among the sailors,\nfrom the beginning of the siege, and he bore a reputation among them\nfor bravery. Therefore his refusal particularly struck and amazed\nKalugin. "That\'s what reputation is worth!" he thought.\n\n"Well, then, I will go alone, if you will permit it," he said, in a\nsomewhat bantering tone to the captain, who, however, paid not the\nslightest heed to his words.\n\nBut Kalugin did not reflect that he had passed, in all, at different\ntimes, perhaps fifty hours on the bastion, while the captain had lived\nthere for six months. Kalugin was actuated, moreover, by vanity, by\na desire to shine, by the hope of reward, of reputation, and by the\ncharm of risk; but the captain had already gone through all that: he\nhad been vain at first, he had displayed valor, he had risked his\nlife, he had hoped for fame and guerdon, and had even obtained them,\nbut these actuating motives had already lost their power over him, and\nhe regarded the matter in another light; he fulfilled his duty with\npunctuality, but understanding quite well how small were the chances\nfor his life which were left him, after a six-months residence in the\nbastion, he no longer risked these casualties, except in case of stern\nnecessity, so that the young lieutenant, who had entered the battery\nonly a week previous, and who was now showing it to Kalugin, in company\nwith whom he took turns in leaning out of the embrasure, or climbing\nout on the ramparts, seemed ten times as brave as the captain.\n\nAfter inspecting the battery, Kalugin returned to the casemate, and ran\nagainst the general in the dark, as the latter was ascending to the\nwatch-tower with his staff-officers.\n\n"Captain Praskukhin!" said the general, "please to go to the first\nlodgement and say to the second battery of the M---- regiment, which is\nat work there, that they are to abandon their work, to evacuate the\nplace without making any noise, and to join their regiment, which is\nstanding at the foot of the hill in reserve.... Do you understand? Lead\nthem to their regiment yourself."\n\n"Yes, sir."\n\nAnd Praskukhin set out for the lodgement on a run.\n\nThe firing was growing more infrequent.\n\n\nX.\n\n"Is this the second battalion of the M---- regiment?" asked Praskukhin,\nhastening up to the spot, and running against the soldiers who were\ncarrying earth in sacks.\n\n"Exactly so."\n\n"Where is the commander?"\n\nMikhailoff, supposing that the inquiry was for the commander of the\ncorps, crawled out of his pit, and, taking Praskukhin for the colonel,\nhe stepped up to him with his hand at his visor.\n\n"The general has given orders ... that you ... are to be so good as to\ngo ... as quickly as possible ... and, in particular, as quietly as\npossible, to the rear ... not to the rear exactly, but to the reserve,"\nsaid Praskukhin, glancing askance at the enemy\'s fires.\n\nOn recognizing Praskukhin and discovering the state of things,\nMikhailoff dropped his hand, gave his orders, and the battalion started\ninto motion, gathered up their guns, put on their cloaks, and set out.\n\nNo one who has not experienced it can imagine the delight which a man\nfeels when he takes his departure, after a three-hours bombardment,\nfrom such a dangerous post as the lodgements. Several times in the\ncourse of those three hours, Mikhailoff had, not without reason,\nconsidered his _end_ as inevitable, and had grown accustomed to the\nconviction that he should infallibly be killed, and that he no longer\nbelonged to this world. In spite of this, however, he had great\ndifficulty in keeping his feet from running away with him when he\nissued from the lodgements at the head of his corps, in company with\nPraskukhin.\n\n"Au revoir," said the major, the commander of another battalion, who\nwas to remain in the lodgements, and with whom he had shared his\ncheese, as they sat in the pit behind the breastworks--"a pleasant\njourney to you."\n\n"Thanks, I hope you will have good luck after we have gone. The firing\nseems to be holding up."\n\nBut no sooner had he said this than the enemy, who must have observed\nthe movement in the lodgements, began to fire faster and faster. Our\nguns began to reply to him, and again a heavy cannonade began. The\nstars were gleaming high, but not brilliantly in the sky. The night was\ndark--you could hardly see your hand before you; only the flashes of\nthe discharges and the explosions of the bombs illuminated objects for\na moment. The soldiers marched on rapidly, in silence, involuntarily\ntreading close on each other\'s heels; all that was audible through the\nincessant firing was the measured sound of their footsteps on the dry\nroad, the noise of their bayonets as they came in contact, or the sigh\nand prayer of some young soldier, "Lord, Lord! what is this!" Now and\nthen the groan of a wounded man arose, and the shout, "Stretcher!"\n(In the company commanded by Mikhailoff, twenty-six men were killed\nin one night, by the fire of the artillery alone.) The lightning\nflashed against the distant horizon, the sentry in the bastion shouted,\n"Can-non!" and the ball, shrieking over the heads of the corps, tore up\nthe earth, and sent the stones flying.\n\n"Deuce take it! how slowly they march," thought Praskukhin, glancing\nback continually, as he walked beside Mikhailoff. "Really, it will be\nbetter for me to run on in front; I have already given the order....\nBut no, it might be said later on that I was a coward. What will be\nwill be; I will march with them."\n\n"Now, why is he walking behind me?" thought Mikhailoff, on his side.\n"So far as I have observed, he always brings ill-luck. There it comes,\nflying straight for us, apparently."\n\nAfter traversing several hundred paces, they encountered Kalugin, who\nwas going to the casemates, clanking his sword boldly as he walked, in\norder to learn, by the general\'s command, how the work was progressing\nthere. But on meeting Mikhailoff, it occurred to him that, instead of\ngoing thither, under that terrible fire, which he was not ordered to\ndo, he could make minute inquiries of the officer who had been there.\nAnd, in fact, Mikhailoff furnished him with a detailed account of the\nwork. After walking a short distance with them, Kalugin turned into the\ntrench, which led to the casemate.\n\n"Well, what news is there?" inquired the officer, who was seated alone\nat the table, and eating his supper.\n\n"Well, nothing, apparently, except that there will not be any further\nconflict."\n\n"How so? On the contrary, the general has but just gone up to the top\nof the works. A regiment has already arrived. Yes, there it is ... do\nyou hear? The firing has begun again. Don\'t go. Why should you?" added\nthe officer, perceiving the movement made by Kalugin.\n\n"But I must be there without fail, in the present instance," thought\nKalugin, "but I have already subjected myself to a good deal of danger\nto-day; the firing is terrible."\n\n"Well, after all, I had better wait for him here," he said.\n\nIn fact, the general returned, twenty minutes later, accompanied by the\nofficers, who had been with him; among their number was the yunker,\nBaron Pesth, but Praskukhin was not with them. The lodgements had been\ncaptured and occupied by our forces.\n\nAfter receiving a full account of the engagement, Kalugin and Pesth\nwent out of the casemates.\n\n\nXI.\n\n"There is blood on your cloak; have you been having a hand-to-hand\nfight?" Kalugin asked him.\n\n"Oh, \'tis frightful! Just imagine...."\n\nAnd Pesth began to relate how he had led his company, how the commander\nof the company had been killed, how he had spitted a Frenchman, and\nhow, if it had not been for him, the battle would have been lost.\n\nThe foundations for this tale, that the company commander had been\nkilled, and that Pesth had killed a Frenchman, were correct; but, in\ngiving the details, the yunker had invented facts and bragged.\n\nHe bragged involuntarily, because, during the whole engagement, he had\nbeen in a kind of mist, and had forgotten himself to such a degree that\neverything which happened seemed to him to have happened somewhere,\nsometime, and with some one, and very naturally he had endeavored\nto bring out these details in a light which should be favorable to\nhimself. But what had happened in reality was this:--\n\nThe battalion to which the yunker had been ordered for the sortie had\nstood under fire for two hours, near a wall; then the commander of\nthe battalion said something, the company commanders made a move, the\nbattalion got under way, issued forth from behind the breastworks,\nmarched forward a hundred paces, and came to a halt in columns. Pesth\nhad been ordered to take his stand on the right flank of the second\ncompany.\n\nThe yunker stood his ground, absolutely without knowing where he was,\nor why he was there, and, with restrained breath, and with a cold chill\nrunning down his spine, he had stared stupidly straight ahead into the\ndark beyond, in the expectation of something terrible. But, since there\nwas no firing in progress, he did not feel so much terrified as he did\nqueer and strange at finding himself outside the fortress, in the open\nplain. Again the battalion commander ahead said something. Again the\nofficers had conversed in whispers, as they communicated the orders,\nand the black wall of the first company suddenly disappeared. They had\nbeen ordered to lie down. The second company lay down also, and Pesth,\nin the act, pricked his hand on something sharp. The only man who did\nnot lie down was the commander of the second company. His short form,\nwith the naked sword which he was flourishing, talking incessantly the\nwhile, moved about in front of the troop.\n\n"Children! my lads! ... look at me! Don\'t fire at them, but at them\nwith your bayonets, the dogs! When I shout, Hurrah! follow me close ...\nthe chief thing is to be as close together as possible ... let us show\nwhat we are made of! Do not let us cover ourselves with shame--shall we,\nhey, my children? For our father the Tsar!"\n\n"What is our company commander\'s surname?" Pesth inquired of a yunker,\nwho was lying beside him. "What a brave fellow he is!"\n\n"Yes, he\'s always that way in a fight ..." answered the yunker. "His\nname is Lisinkovsky."\n\nAt that moment, a flame flashed up in front of the company. There\nwas a crash, which deafened them all, stones and splinters flew high\nin the air (fifty seconds, at least, later a stone fell from above\nand crushed the foot of a soldier). This was a bomb from an elevated\nplatform, and the fact that it fell in the midst of the company proved\nthat the French had caught sight of the column.\n\n"So they are sending bombs!... Just let us get at you, and you shall\nfeel the bayonet of a three-sided Russian, curse you!" shouted the\ncommander of the company, in so loud a tone that the battalion\ncommander was forced to order him to be quiet and not to make so much\nnoise.\n\nAfter this the first company rose to their feet, and after it the\nsecond. They were ordered to fix bayonets, and the battalion advanced.\nPesth was so terrified that he absolutely could not recollect whether\nthey advanced far, or whither, or who did what. He walked like a\ndrunken man. But all at once millions of fires flashed from all sides,\nthere was a whistling and a crashing. He shrieked and ran, because\nthey were all shrieking and running. Then he stumbled and fell upon\nsomething. It was the company commander (who had been wounded at the\nhead of his men and who, taking the yunker for a Frenchman, seized him\nby the leg). Then when he had freed his leg, and risen to his feet,\nsome man ran against his back in the dark and almost knocked him down\nagain; another man shouted, "Run him through! what are you staring at!"\n\nThen he seized a gun, and ran the bayonet into something soft. "Ah,\nDieu!" exclaimed some one in a terribly piercing voice, and then only\ndid Pesth discover that he had transfixed a Frenchman. The cold sweat\nstarted out all over his body. He shook as though in a fever, and flung\naway the gun. But this lasted only a moment; it immediately occurred\nto him that he was a hero. He seized the gun again, and, shouting\n"Hurrah!" with the crowd, he rushed away from the dead Frenchman. After\nhaving traversed about twenty paces, he came to the trench. There he\nfound our men and the company commander.\n\n"I have run one man through!" he said to the commander.\n\n"You\'re a brave fellow, Baron."\n\n\nXII.\n\n"But, do you know, Praskukhin has been killed," said Pesth,\naccompanying Kalugin, on the way back.\n\n"It cannot be!"\n\n"But it can. I saw him myself."\n\n"Farewell; I am in a hurry."\n\n"I am well content," thought Kalugin, as he returned home; "I have had\nluck for the first time when on duty. That was a capital engagement,\nand I am alive and whole. There will be some fine presentations, and I\nshall certainly get a golden sword. And I deserve it too."\n\nAfter reporting to the general all that was necessary, he went to his\nroom, in which sat Prince Galtsin, who had returned long before, and\nwho was reading a book, which he had found on Kalugin\'s table, while\nwaiting for him.\n\nIt was with a wonderful sense of enjoyment that Kalugin found himself\nat home again, out of all danger, and, having donned his night-shirt\nand lain down on the sofa, he began to relate to Galtsin the\nparticulars of the affair, communicating them, naturally, from a point\nof view which made it appear that he, Kalugin, was a very active and\nvaliant officer, to which, in my opinion, it was superfluous to refer,\nseeing that every one knew it and that no one had any right to doubt\nit, with the exception, perhaps, of the deceased Captain Praskukhin,\nwho, in spite of the fact that he had considered it a piece of\nhappiness to walk arm in arm with Kalugin, had told a friend, only the\nevening before, in private, that Kalugin was a very fine man, but that,\nbetween you and me, he was terribly averse to going to the bastions.\n\nNo sooner had Praskukhin, who had been walking beside Mikhailoff,\ntaken leave of Kalugin, and, betaking himself to a safer place, had\nbegun to recover his spirits somewhat, than he caught sight of a flash\nof lightning behind him flaring up vividly, heard the shout of the\nsentinel, "Mortar!" and the words of the soldiers who were marching\nbehind, "It\'s flying straight at the bastion!"\n\nMikhailoff glanced round. The brilliant point of the bomb seemed to\nbe suspended directly over his head in such a position that it was\nabsolutely impossible to determine its course. But this lasted only\nfor a second. The bomb came faster and faster, nearer and nearer, the\nsparks of the fuse were already visible, and the fateful whistle was\naudible, and it descended straight in the middle of the battalion.\n\n"Lie down!" shouted a voice.\n\nMikhailoff and Praskukhin threw themselves on the ground. Praskukhin\nshut his eyes, and only heard the bomb crash against the hard earth\nsomewhere in the vicinity. A second passed, which seemed an hour--and\nthe bomb had not burst. Praskukhin was alarmed; had he felt cowardly\nfor nothing? Perhaps the bomb had fallen at a distance, and it merely\nseemed to him that the fuse was hissing near him. He opened his eyes,\nand saw with satisfaction that Mikhailoff was lying motionless on the\nearth, at his very feet. But then his eyes encountered for a moment the\nglowing fuse of the bomb, which was twisting about at a distance of an\narshin from him.\n\nA cold horror, which excluded every other thought and feeling, took\npossession of his whole being. He covered his face with his hands.\n\nAnother second passed--a second in which a whole world of thoughts,\nfeelings, hopes, and memories flashed through his mind.\n\n"Which will be killed, Mikhailoff or I? Or both together? And if it is\nI, where will it strike? If in the head, then all is over with me; but\nif in the leg, they will cut it off, and I shall ask them to be sure\nto give me chloroform,--and I may still remain among the living. But\nperhaps no one but Mikhailoff will be killed; then I will relate how\nwe were walking along together, and how he was killed and his blood\nspurted over me. No, it is nearer to me ... it will kill me!"\n\nThen he remembered the twenty rubles which he owed Mikhailoff, and\nrecalled another debt in Petersburg, which ought to have been paid long\nago; the gypsy air which he had sung the previous evening recurred\nto him. The woman whom he loved appeared to his imagination in a cap\nwith lilac ribbons, a man who had insulted him five years before, and\nwhom he had not paid off for his insult, came to his mind, though\ninextricably interwoven with these and with a thousand other memories\nthe feeling of the moment--the fear of death--never deserted him for an\ninstant.\n\n"But perhaps it will not burst," he thought, and, with the decision\nof despair, he tried to open his eyes. But at that instant, through\nthe crevice of his eyelids, his eyes were smitten with a red fire, and\nsomething struck him in the centre of the breast, with a frightful\ncrash; he ran off, he knew not whither, stumbled over his sword, which\nhad got between his legs, and fell over on his side.\n\n"Thank God! I am only bruised," was his first thought, and he tried\nto touch his breast with his hands; but his arms seemed fettered, and\npincers were pressing his head. The soldiers flitted before his eyes,\nand he unconsciously counted them: "One, two, three soldiers; and there\nis an officer, wrapped up in his cloak," he thought. Then a flash\npassed before his eyes, and he thought that something had been fired\noff; was it the mortars, or the cannon? It must have been the cannon.\nAnd there was still another shot; and there were more soldiers; five,\nsix, seven soldiers were passing by him. Then suddenly he felt afraid\nthat they would crush him. He wanted to shout to them that he was\nbruised; but his mouth was so dry that his tongue clove to his palate\nand he was tortured by a frightful thirst.\n\nHe felt that he was wet about the breast: this sensation of dampness\nreminded him of water, and he even wanted to drink this, whatever it\nwas. "I must have brought the blood when I fell," he thought, and,\nbeginning to give way more and more to terror, lest the soldiers who\npassed should crush him, he collected all his strength, and tried to\ncry: "Take me with you!" but, instead of this, he groaned so terribly\nthat it frightened him to hear himself. Then more red fires flashed in\nhis eyes--and it seemed to him as though the soldiers were laying stones\nupon him; the fires danced more and more rarely, the stones which they\npiled on him oppressed him more and more.\n\nHe exerted all his strength, in order to cast off the stones; he\nstretched himself out, and no longer saw or heard or thought or felt\nanything. He had been killed on the spot by a splinter of shell, in the\nmiddle of the breast.\n\n\nXIII.\n\nMikhailoff, on catching sight of the bomb, fell to the earth, and, like\nPraskukhin, he went over in thought and feeling an incredible amount in\nthose two seconds while the bomb lay there unexploded. He prayed to God\nmentally, and kept repeating: "Thy will be done!"\n\n"And why did I enter the military service?" he thought at the same\ntime; "and why, again, did I exchange into the infantry, in order to\ntake part in this campaign? Would it not have been better for me to\nremain in the regiment of Uhlans, in the town of T., and pass the time\nwith my friend Natasha? And now this is what has come of it."\n\nAnd he began to count, "One, two, three, four," guessing that if it\nburst on the even number, he would live, but if on the uneven number,\nthen he should be killed. "All is over; killed," he thought, when the\nbomb burst (he did not remember whether it was on the even or the\nuneven number), and he felt a blow, and a sharp pain in his head.\n"Lord, forgive my sins," he murmured, folding his hands, then rose, and\nfell back senseless.\n\nHis first sensation, when he came to himself, was the blood which was\nflowing from his nose, and a pain in his head, which had become much\nless powerful. "It is my soul departing," he thought.--"What will it\nbe like _there_? Lord, receive my soul in peace!--But one thing is\nstrange," he thought,--"and that is that, though dying, I can still hear\nso plainly the footsteps of the soldiers and the report of the shots."\n\n"Send some bearers ... hey there ... the captain is killed!" shouted a\nvoice over his head, which he recognized as the voice of his drummer\nIgnatieff.\n\nSome one grasped him by the shoulders. He made an effort to open his\neyes, and saw overhead the dark blue heavens, the clusters of stars,\nand two bombs, which were flying over him, one after the other; he saw\nIgnatieff, the soldiers with the stretcher, the walls of the trench,\nand all at once he became convinced that he was not yet in the other\nworld.\n\nHe had been slightly wounded in the head with a stone. His very first\nimpression was one resembling regret; he had so beautifully and so\ncalmly prepared himself for transit _yonder_ that a return to reality,\nwith its bombs, its trenches, and its blood, produced a disagreeable\neffect on him; his second impression was an involuntary joy that he\nwas alive, and the third a desire to leave the bastion as speedily\nas possible. The drummer bound up his commander\'s head with his\nhandkerchief, and, taking him under the arm, he led him to the place\nwhere the bandaging was going on.\n\n"But where am I going, and why?" thought the staff-captain, when\nhe recovered his senses a little.--"It is my duty to remain with my\nmen,--the more so as they will soon be out of range of the shots," some\nvoice whispered to him.\n\n"Never mind, brother," he said, pulling his arm away from the obliging\ndrummer. "I will not go to the field-hospital; I will remain with my\nmen."\n\nAnd he turned back.\n\n"You had better have your wound properly attended to, Your Honor,"\nsaid Ignatieff. "In the heat of the moment, it seems as if it were\na trifle; but it will be the worse if not attended to. There is some\ninflammation rising there ... really, now, Your Honor."\n\nMikhailoff paused for a moment in indecision, and would have\nfollowed Ignatieff\'s advice, in all probability, had he not called\nto mind how many severely wounded men there must needs be at the\nfield-hospital. "Perhaps the doctor will smile at my scratch," thought\nthe staff-captain, and he returned with decision to his men, wholly\nregardless of the drummer\'s admonitions.\n\n"And where is Officer Praskukhin, who was walking with me?" he asked\nthe lieutenant, who was leading the corps when they met.\n\n"I don\'t know--killed, probably," replied the lieutenant, reluctantly.\n\n"How is it that you do not know whether he was killed or wounded? He\nwas walking with us. And why have you not carried him with you?"\n\n"How could it be done, brother, when the place was so hot for us!"\n\n"Ah, how could you do such a thing, Mikhail Ivanowitch!" said\nMikhailoff, angrily.--"How could you abandon him if he was alive; and if\nhe was dead, you should still have brought away his body."\n\n"How could he be alive when, as I tell you, I went up to him and saw!"\nreturned the lieutenant.--"As you like, however! Only, his own men might\ncarry him off. Here, you dogs! the cannonade has abated," he added....\n\nMikhailoff sat down, and clasped his head, which the motion caused to\npain him terribly.\n\n"Yes, I must go and get him, without fail; perhaps he is still alive,"\nsaid Mikhailoff. "It is our duty, Mikhail Ivanowitch!"\n\nMikhail Ivanowitch made no reply.\n\n"He did not take him at the time, and now the soldiers must be sent\nalone--and how can they be sent? their lives may be sacrificed in vain,\nunder that hot fire," thought Mikhailoff.\n\n"Children! we must go back--and get the officer who was wounded there in\nthe ditch," he said, in not too loud and commanding a tone, for he felt\nhow unpleasant it would be to the soldiers to obey his order,--and, in\nfact, as he did not address any one in particular by name, no one set\nout to fulfil it.\n\n"It is quite possible that he is already dead, and it is _not worth\nwhile_ to subject the men to unnecessary danger; I alone am to blame\nfor not having seen to it. I will go myself and learn whether he is\nalive. It is my duty," said Mikhailoff to himself.\n\n"Mikhail Ivanowitch! Lead the men forward, and I will overtake you,"\nhe said, and, pulling up his cloak with one hand, and with the other\nconstantly touching the image of Saint Mitrofaniy, in which he\ncherished a special faith, he set off on a run along the trench.\n\nHaving convinced himself that Praskukhin was dead, he dragged himself\nback, panting, and supporting with his hand the loosened bandage and\nhis head, which began to pain him severely. The battalion had already\nreached the foot of the hill, and a place almost out of range of shots,\nwhen Mikhailoff overtook it. I say, _almost_ out of range, because some\nstray bombs struck here and there.\n\n"At all events, I must go to the hospital to-morrow, and put down my\nname," thought the staff-captain, as the medical student assisting the\ndoctors bound his wound.\n\n\nXIV.\n\nHundreds of bodies, freshly smeared with blood, of men who two hours\nprevious had been filled with divers lofty or petty hopes and desires,\nnow lay, with stiffened limbs, in the dewy, flowery valley which\nseparated the bastion from the trench, and on the level floor of the\nchapel for the dead in Sevastopol; hundreds of men crawled, twisted,\nand groaned, with curses and prayers on their parched lips, some amid\nthe corpses in the flower-strewn vale, others on stretchers, on cots,\nand on the blood-stained floor of the hospital.\n\nAnd still, as on the days preceding, the dawn glowed, over Sapun\nMountain, the twinkling stars paled, the white mist spread abroad\nfrom the dark sounding sea, the red glow illuminated the east, long\ncrimson cloudlets darted across the blue horizon; and still, as on days\npreceding, the powerful, all-beautiful sun rose up, giving promise of\njoy, love, and happiness to all who dwell in the world.\n\n\nXV.\n\nOn the following day, the band of the chasseurs was playing again on\nthe boulevard, and again officers, cadets, soldiers, and young women\nwere promenading in festive guise about the pavilion and through the\nlow-hanging alleys of fragrant white acacias in bloom.\n\nKalugin, Prince Galtsin, and some colonel or other were walking\narm-in-arm near the pavilion, and discussing the engagement of the day\nbefore. As always happens in such cases, the chief governing thread\nof the conversation was not the engagement itself, but the part which\nthose who were narrating the story of the affair took in it.\n\nTheir faces and the sound of their voices had a serious, almost\nmelancholy expression, as though the loss of the preceding day had\ntouched and saddened them deeply; but, to tell the truth, as none of\nthem had lost any one very near to him, this expression of sorrow was\nan official expression, which they merely felt it to be their duty to\nexhibit.\n\nOn the contrary, Kalugin and the colonel were ready to see an\nengagement of the same sort every day, provided that they might receive\na gold sword or the rank of major-general--notwithstanding the fact that\nthey were very fine fellows.\n\nI like it when any warrior who destroys millions to gratify his\nambition is called a monster. Only question any Lieutenant Petrushkoff,\nand Sub-Lieutenant Antonoff, and so on, on their word of honor, and\nevery one of them is a petty Napoleon, a petty monster, and ready to\nbring on a battle on the instant, to murder a hundred men, merely for\nthe sake of receiving an extra cross or an increase of a third in his\npay.\n\n"No, excuse me," said the colonel; "it began first on the left flank.\n_I was there myself._"\n\n"Possibly," answered Kalugin. "_I was farther on the right; I went\nthere twice. Once I was in search of the general, and the second time I\nwent merely to inspect the lodgements. It was a hot place._"\n\n"Yes, of course, Kalugin knows," said Prince Galtsin to the colonel.\n"You know that V. told me to-day that you were a brave fellow...."\n\n"But the losses, the losses were terrible," said the colonel. "_I lost\nfour hundred men from my regiment. It\'s a wonder that I escaped from\nthere alive._"\n\nAt this moment, the figure of Mikhailoff, with his head bandaged,\nappeared at the other extremity of the boulevard, coming to meet these\ngentlemen.\n\n"What, are you wounded, captain?" said Kalugin.\n\n"Yes, slightly, with a stone," replied Mikhailoff.\n\n"Has the flag been lowered yet?"[H] inquired Prince Galtsin, gazing\nover the staff-captain\'s cap, and addressing himself to no one in\nparticular.\n\n[H] This sentence is in French.\n\n"Non, pas encore," answered Mikhailoff, who wished to show that he\nunderstood and spoke French.\n\n"Is the truce still in force?" said Galtsin, addressing him courteously\nin Russian, and thereby intimating--so it seemed to the captain--It\nmust be difficult for you to speak French, so why is it not better to\ntalk in your own tongue simply?... And with this the adjutants left\nhim. The staff-captain again felt lonely, as on the preceding evening,\nand, exchanging salutes with various gentlemen,--some he did not care,\nand others he did not dare, to join,--he seated himself near Kazarsky\'s\nmonument, and lighted a cigarette.\n\nBaron Pesth also had come to the boulevard. He had been telling how he\nhad gone over to arrange the truce, and had conversed with the French\nofficers, and he declared that one had said to him, "If daylight had\nheld off another half-hour, these ambushes would have been retaken;"\nand that he had replied, "Sir, I refrain from saying no, in order not\nto give you the lie," and how well he had said it, and so on.\n\nBut, in reality, although he had had a hand in the truce, he had not\ndared to say anything very particular there, although he had been very\ndesirous of talking with the French (for it is awfully jolly to talk\nwith Frenchmen). Yunker Baron Pesth had marched up and down the line\nfor a long time, incessantly inquiring of the Frenchmen who were near\nhim: "To what regiment do you belong?" They answered him; and that was\nthe end of it.\n\nWhen he walked too far along the line, the French sentry, not\nsuspecting that this soldier understood French, cursed him. "He\nhas come to spy out our works, the cursed ..." said he; and, in\nconsequence, Yunker Baron Pesth, taking no further interest in the\ntruce, went home, and thought out on the way thither those French\nphrases, which he had now repeated. Captain Zoboff was also on the\nboulevard, talking loudly, and Captain Obzhogoff, in a very dishevelled\ncondition, and an artillery captain, who courted no one, and was happy\nin the love of the yunkers, and all the faces which had been there on\nthe day before, and all still actuated by the same motives. No one was\nmissing except Praskukhin, Neferdoff, and some others, whom hardly any\none remembered or thought of now, though their bodies were not yet\nwashed, laid out, and interred in the earth.\n\n\nXVI.\n\nWhite flags had been hung out from our bastion, and from the trenches\nof the French, and in the blooming valley between them lay disfigured\ncorpses, shoeless, in garments of gray or blue, which laborers were\nengaged in carrying off and heaping upon carts. The odor of the dead\nbodies filled the air. Throngs of people had poured out of Sevastopol,\nand from the French camp, to gaze upon this spectacle, and they pressed\none after the other with eager and benevolent curiosity.\n\nListen to what these people are saying.\n\nHere, in a group of Russians and French who have come together, is a\nyoung officer, who speaks French badly, but well enough to make himself\nunderstood, examining a cartridge-box of the guards.\n\n"And what is this bird here for?" says he.\n\n"Because it is a cartridge-box belonging to a regiment of the guards,\nMonsieur, and bears the Imperial eagle."\n\n"And do you belong to the guard?"\n\n"Pardon, Monsieur, I belong to the sixth regiment of the line."\n\n"And this--bought where?" asks the officer, pointing to a cigar-holder\nof yellow wood, in which the Frenchman was smoking his cigarette.\n\n"At Balaklava, Monsieur. It is very plain, of palm-wood."\n\n"Pretty!" says the officer, guided in his conversation not so much by\nhis own wishes as by the words which he knows.\n\n"If you will have the kindness to keep it as a souvenir of this\nmeeting, you will confer an obligation on me."\n\nAnd the polite Frenchman blows out the cigarette, and hands the holder\nover to the officer with a little bow. The officer gives him his, and\nall the members of the group, Frenchmen as well as Russians, appear\nvery much pleased and smile.\n\nThen a bold infantryman, in a pink shirt, with his cloak thrown over\nhis shoulders, accompanied by two other soldiers, who, with their\nhands behind their backs, were standing behind him, with merry, curious\ncountenances, stepped up to a Frenchman, and requested a light for his\npipe. The Frenchman brightened his fire, stirred up his short pipe, and\nshook out a light for the Russian.\n\n"Tobacco good!" said the soldier in the pink shirt; and the spectators\nsmile.\n\n"Yes, good tobacco, Turkish tobacco," says the Frenchman. "And your\ntobacco--Russian?--good?"\n\n"Russian, good," says the soldier in the pink shirt: whereupon\nthose present shake with laughter. "The French not good--_bon jour,\nMonsieur_," says the soldier in the pink shirt, letting fly his entire\ncharge of knowledge in the language at once, as he laughs and taps the\nFrenchman on the stomach. The French join in the laugh.\n\n"They are not handsome, these beasts of Russians," says a zouave, amid\nthe crowd of Frenchmen.\n\n"What are they laughing about?" says another black-complexioned one,\nwith an Italian accent, approaching our men.\n\n"Caftan good," says the audacious soldier, staring at the zouave\'s\nembroidered coat-skirts, and then there is another laugh.\n\n"Don\'t leave your lines; back to your places, _sacre nom_!" shouts a\nFrench corporal, and the soldiers disperse with evident reluctance.\n\nIn the meantime, our young cavalry officer is making the tour of the\nFrench officers. The conversation turns on some Count Sazonoff, "with\nwhom I was very well acquainted, Monsieur," says a French officer, with\none epaulet--"he is one of those real Russian counts, of whom we are so\nfond."\n\n"There is a Sazonoff with whom I am acquainted," said the cavalry\nofficer, "but he is not a count, so far as I know, at least; a little\ndark-complexioned man, of about your age."\n\n"Exactly, Monsieur, that is the man. Oh, how I should like to see that\ndear count! If you see him, pray, present my compliments to him--Captain\nLatour," says he, bowing.\n\n"Isn\'t this a terrible business that we are conducting here? It was\nhot work last night, wasn\'t it?" says the cavalry officer, wishing to\ncontinue the conversation, and pointing to the dead bodies.\n\n"Oh, frightful, Monsieur! But what brave fellows your soldiers are--what\nbrave fellows! It is a pleasure to fight with such valiant fellows."\n\n"It must be admitted that your men do not hang back, either," says the\ncavalry-man, with a bow, and the conviction that he is very amiable.\n\nBut enough of this.\n\nLet us rather observe this lad of ten, clad in an ancient cap, his\nfather\'s probably, shoes worn on bare feet, and nankeen breeches, held\nup by a single suspender, who had climbed over the wall at the very\nbeginning of the truce, and has been roaming about the ravine, staring\nwith dull curiosity at the French, and at the bodies which are lying\non the earth, and plucking the blue wild-flowers with which the valley\nis studded. On his way home with a large bouquet, he held his nose\nbecause of the odor which the wind wafted to him, and paused beside\na pile of corpses, which had been carried off the field, and stared\nlong at one terrible headless body, which chanced to be the nearest to\nhim. After standing there for a long while, he stepped up closer, and\ntouched with his foot the stiffened arm of the corpse which protruded.\nThe arm swayed a little. He touched it again, and with more vigor.\nThe arm swung back, and then fell into place again. And at once the\nboy uttered a shriek, hid his face in the flowers, and ran off to the\nfortifications as fast as he could go.\n\nYes, white flags are hung out from the bastion and the trenches, the\nflowery vale is filled with dead bodies, the splendid sun sinks into\nthe blue sea, and the blue sea undulates and glitters in the golden\nrays of the sun. Thousands of people congregate, gaze, talk, and smile\nat each other. And why do not Christian people, who profess the one\ngreat law of love and self-sacrifice, when they behold what they have\nwrought, fall in repentance upon their knees before Him who, when he\ngave them life, implanted in the soul of each of them, together with a\nfear of death, a love of the good and the beautiful, and, with tears\nof joy and happiness, embrace each other like brothers? No! But it\nis a comfort to think that it was not we who began this war, that we\nare only defending our own country, our father-land. The white flags\nhave been hauled in, and again the weapons of death and suffering are\nshrieking; again innocent blood is shed, and groans and curses are\naudible.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI have now said all that I wish to say at this time. But a heavy\nthought overmasters me. Perhaps it should not have been said;\nperhaps what I have said belongs to one of those evil truths which,\nunconsciously concealed in the soul of each man, should not be uttered,\nlest they become pernicious, as a cask of wine should not be shaken,\nlest it be thereby spoiled.\n\nWhere is the expression of evil which should be avoided? Where is the\nexpression of good which should be imitated in this sketch? Who is the\nvillain, who the hero? All are good, and all are evil.\n\nNeither Kalugin, with his brilliant bravery--_bravoure de\ngentilhomme_--and his vanity, the instigator of all his deeds; nor\nPraskukhin, the empty-headed, harmless man, though he fell in battle\nfor the faith, the throne, and his native land; nor Mikhailoff,\nwith his shyness; nor Pesth, a child with no firm convictions or\nprinciples, can be either the heroes or the villains of the tale.\n\nThe hero of my tale, whom I love with all the strength of my soul, whom\nI have tried to set forth in all his beauty, and who has always been,\nis, and always will be most beautiful, is--the truth.\n\n\n\n\nSEVASTOPOL IN AUGUST, 1855.\n\n\nI.\n\nAt the end of August, along the rocky highway to Sevastopol, between\nDuvanka and Bakhtchisarai, through the thick, hot dust, at a foot-pace,\ndrove an officer\'s light cart, that peculiar _telyezhka_, not now to\nbe met with, which stands about half-way between a Jewish _britchka_,\na Russian travelling-carriage, and a basket-wagon. In the front of\nthe wagon, holding the reins, squatted the servant, clad in a nankeen\ncoat and an officer\'s cap, which had become quite limp; seated behind,\non bundles and packages covered with a military coat, was an infantry\nofficer, in a summer cloak.\n\nAs well as could be judged from his sitting position, the officer was\nnot tall in stature, but extremely thick, and that not so much from\nshoulder to shoulder as from chest to back; he was broad and thick,\nand his neck and the base of the head were excessively developed and\nswollen. His waist, so called, a receding strip in the centre of the\nbody, did not exist in his case; but neither had he any belly; on\nthe contrary, he was rather thin than otherwise, particularly in the\nface, which was overspread with an unhealthy yellowish sunburn. His\nface would have been handsome had it not been for a certain bloated\nappearance, and the soft, yet not elderly, heavy wrinkles that flowed\ntogether and enlarged his features, imparting to the whole countenance\na general expression of coarseness and of lack of freshness. His eyes\nwere small, brown, extremely searching, even bold; his moustache was\nvery thick, but the ends were kept constantly short by his habit of\ngnawing them; and his chin, and his cheek-bones in particular were\ncovered with a remarkably strong, thick, and black beard, of two days\'\ngrowth.\n\nThe officer had been wounded on the 10th of May, by a splinter, in the\nhead, on which he still wore a bandage, and, having now felt perfectly\nwell for the last week, he had come out of the Simferopol Hospital, to\nrejoin his regiment, which was stationed somewhere in the direction\nfrom which shots could be heard; but whether that was in Sevastopol\nitself, on the northern defences, or at Inkermann, he had not so far\nsucceeded in ascertaining with much accuracy from any one.\n\nShots were still audible near at hand, especially at intervals, when\nthe hills did not interfere, or when borne on the wind with great\ndistinctness and frequency, and apparently near at hand. Then it seemed\nas though some explosion shook the air, and caused an involuntary\nshudder. Then, one after the other, followed less resounding reports in\nquick succession, like a drum-beat, interrupted at times by a startling\nroar. Then, everything mingled in a sort of reverberating crash,\nresembling peals of thunder, when a thunder-storm is in full force, and\nthe rain has just begun to pour down in floods, every one said; and it\ncould be heard that the bombardment was progressing frightfully.\n\nThe officer kept urging on his servant, and seemed desirous of\narriving as speedily as possible. They were met by a long train of the\nRussian-peasant type, which had carried provisions into Sevastopol, and\nwas now returning with sick and wounded soldiers in gray coats, sailors\nin black paletots, volunteers in red fezes, and bearded militia-men.\nThe officer\'s light cart had to halt in the thick, immovable cloud of\ndust raised by the carts, and the officer, blinking and frowning with\nthe dust that stuffed his eyes and ears, gazed at the faces of the sick\nand wounded as they passed.\n\n"Ah, there\'s a sick soldier from our company," said the servant,\nturning to his master, and pointing to the wagon which was just on a\nline with them, full of wounded, at the moment.\n\nOn the cart, towards the front, a bearded Russian, in a lamb\'s-wool\ncap, was seated sidewise, and, holding the stock of his whip under\nhis elbow, was tying on the lash. Behind him in the cart, about five\nsoldiers, in different positions, were shaking about. One, though pale\nand thin, with his arm in a bandage, and his cloak thrown on over his\nshirt, was sitting up bravely in the middle of the cart, and tried\nto touch his cap on seeing the officer, but immediately afterwards\n(recollecting, probably, that he was wounded) he pretended that he only\nwanted to scratch his head. Another, beside him, was lying flat on the\nbottom of the wagon; all that was visible was two hands, as they clung\nto the rails of the wagon, and his knees uplifted limp as mops, as they\nswayed about in various directions. A third, with a swollen face and a\nbandaged head, on which was placed his soldier\'s cap, sat on one side,\nwith his legs dangling over the wheel, and, with his elbows resting on\nhis knees, seemed immersed in thought. It was to him that the passing\nofficer addressed himself.\n\n"Dolzhnikoff!" he exclaimed.\n\n"Here," replied the soldier, opening his eyes, and pulling off his cap,\nin such a thick and halting bass voice that it seemed as though twenty\nsoldiers had uttered an exclamation at one and the same time.\n\n"When were you wounded, brother?"\n\nThe leaden and swimming eyes of the soldier grew animated; he evidently\nrecognized his officer.\n\n"I wish Your Honor health!" he began again, in the same abrupt bass as\nbefore.\n\n"Where is the regiment stationed now?"\n\n"It was stationed in Sevastopol, but they were to move on Wednesday,\nYour Honor."\n\n"Where to?"\n\n"I don\'t know; it must have been to the Sivernaya, Your Honor! To-day,\nYour Honor," he added, in a drawling voice, as he put on his cap,\n"they have begun to fire clear across, mostly with bombs, that even go\nas far as the bay; they are fighting horribly to-day, so that--"\n\nIt was impossible to hear what the soldier said further; but it was\nevident, from the expression of his countenance and from his attitude,\nthat he was uttering discouraging remarks, with the touch of malice of\na man who is suffering.\n\nThe travelling officer, Lieutenant Kozeltzoff, was no common officer.\nHe was not one of those that live so and so and do thus and so because\nothers live and do thus; he did whatever he pleased, and others did the\nsame, and were convinced that it was well. He was rather richly endowed\nby nature with small gifts: he sang well, played on the guitar, talked\nvery cleverly, and wrote very easily, particularly official documents,\nin which he had practised his hand in his capacity of adjutant of the\nbattalion; but the most noticeable trait in his character was his\negotistical energy, which, although chiefly founded on this array of\npetty talents, constituted in itself a sharp and striking trait. His\negotism was of the sort that is most frequently found developed in\nmasculine and especially in military circles, and which had become a\npart of his life to such a degree that he understood no other choice\nthan to domineer or to humiliate himself; and his egotism was the\nmainspring even of his private impulses; he liked to usurp the first\nplace over people with whom he put himself on a level.\n\n"Well! it\'s absurd of me to listen to what a Moskva[I] chatters!"\nmuttered the lieutenant, experiencing a certain weight of apathy in\nhis heart, and a dimness of thought, which the sight of the transport\nfull of wounded and the words of the soldier, whose significance was\nemphasized and confirmed by the sounds of the bombardment, had left\nwith him. "_That Moskva is ridiculous!_ Drive on, Nikolaeff! go ahead!\nAre you asleep?" he added, rather fretfully, to the servant, as he\nre-arranged the skirts of his coat.\n\n[I] In many regiments the officers call a soldier, half in scorn, half\ncaressingly, _Moskva_ (Moscovite), or _prisyaga_ (an oath).\n\nThe reins were tightened, Nikolaeff clacked his lips, and the wagon\nmoved on at a trot.\n\n"We will only halt a minute for food, and will proceed at once, this\nvery day," said the officer.\n\n\nII.\n\nAs he entered the street of the ruined remains of the stone wall,\nforming the Tatar houses of Duvanka, Lieutenant Kozeltzoff was stopped\nby a transport of bombs and grape-shot, which were on their way to\nSevastopol, and had accumulated on the road. Two infantry soldiers\nwere seated in the dust, on the stones of a ruined garden-wall by the\nroadside, devouring a watermelon and bread.\n\n"Have you come far, fellow-countryman?" said one of them, as he chewed\nhis bread, to the soldier, with a small knapsack on his back, who had\nhalted near them.\n\n"I have come from my government to join my regiment," replied the\nsoldier, turning his eyes away from the watermelon, and readjusting the\nsack on his back. "There we were, two weeks ago, at work on the hay,\na whole troop of us; but now they have drafted all of us, and we don\'t\nknow where our regiment is at the present time. They say that our men\nwent on the Korabelnaya last week. Have you heard anything, gentlemen?"\n\n"It\'s stationed in the town, brother," said the second, an old soldier\nof the reserves, digging away with his clasp-knife at the white, unripe\nmelon. "We have just come from there, this afternoon. It\'s terrible, my\nbrother!"\n\n"How so, gentlemen?"\n\n"Don\'t you hear how they are firing all around to-day, so that there\nis not a whole spot anywhere? It is impossible to say how many of our\nbrethren have been killed." And the speaker waved his hand and adjusted\nhis cap.\n\nThe passing soldier shook his head thoughtfully, gave a clack with his\ntongue, then pulled his pipe from his boot-leg, and, without filling\nit, stirred up the half-burned tobacco, lit a bit of tinder from the\nsoldier who was smoking, and raised his cap.\n\n"There is no one like God, gentlemen! Good-bye," said he, and, with a\nshake of the sack on his back, he went his way.\n\n"Hey, there! you\'d better wait," said the man who was digging out the\nwatermelon, with an air of conviction.\n\n"It makes no difference!" muttered the traveller, threading his way\namong the wheels of the assembled transports.\n\n\nIII.\n\nThe posting-station was full of people when Kozeltzoff drove up to it.\nThe first person whom he encountered, on the porch itself, was a thin\nand very young man, the superintendent, who continued his altercation\nwith two officers, who had followed him out.\n\n"It\'s not three days only, but ten that you will have to wait. Even\ngenerals wait, my good sirs!" said the superintendent, with a desire to\nadminister a prick to the travellers; "and I am not going to harness up\nfor you."\n\n"Then don\'t give anybody horses, if there are none! But why furnish\nthem to some lackey or other with baggage?" shouted the elder of the\ntwo officers, with a glass of tea in his hand, and plainly avoiding the\nuse of pronouns,[J] but giving it to be understood that he might very\neasily address the superintendent as "_thou_."\n\n[J] This effect cannot be reproduced in English.\n\n"Judge for yourself, now, Mr. Superintendent," said the younger\nofficer, with some hesitation. "We don\'t want to go for our own\npleasure. We must certainly be needed, since we have been called for.\nAnd I certainly shall report to the general. But this, of course,--you\nknow that you are not paying proper respect to the military profession."\n\n"You are always spoiling things," the elder man interrupted, with\nvexation. "You only hinder me; you must know how to talk to them. Here,\nnow, he has lost his respect. Horses this very instant, I say!"\n\n"I should be glad to give them to you, _batiushka_,[K] but where am I\nto get them?"\n\n[K] "My good sir," a familiarly respectful mode of address.\n\nAfter a brief silence, the superintendent began to grow irritated, and\nto talk, flourishing his hands the while.\n\n"I understand, _batiushka_. And I know all about it myself. But what\nare you going to do? Only give me"--here a ray of hope gleamed across\nthe faces of the officers--"only give me a chance to live until the end\nof the month, and you won\'t see me here any longer. I\'d rather go on\nthe Malakhoff tower, by Heavens! than stay here. Let them do what they\nplease about it! There\'s not a single sound team in the station this\nday, and the horses haven\'t seen a wisp of hay these three days." And\nthe superintendent disappeared behind the gate.\n\nKozeltzoff entered the room in company with the officers.\n\n"Well," said the elder officer, quite calmly, to the younger one,\nalthough but a second before he had appeared to be greatly irritated,\n"we have been travelling these three weeks, and we will wait a little\nlonger. There\'s no harm done. We shall get there at last."\n\nThe dirty, smoky apartment was so filled with officers and trunks that\nit was with difficulty that Kozeltzoff found a place near the window,\nwhere he seated himself; he began to roll himself a cigarette, as he\nglanced at the faces and lent an ear to the conversations.\n\nTo the right of the door, near a crippled and greasy table, upon which\nstood two samovars, whose copper had turned green in spots, here and\nthere, and where sugar was portioned out in various papers, sat the\nprincipal group. A young officer, without moustache, in a new, short,\nwadded summer coat, was pouring water into the teapot.\n\nFour such young officers were there, in different corners of the room.\nOne of them had placed a cloak under his head, and was fast asleep on\nthe sofa. Another, standing by the table, was cutting up some roast\nmutton for an officer without an arm, who was seated at the table.\n\nTwo officers, one in an adjutant\'s cloak, the other in an infantry\ncloak, a thin one however, and with a satchel strapped over his\nshoulder, were sitting near the oven bench, and it was evident, from\nthe very way in which they stared at the rest, and from the manner in\nwhich the one with the satchel smoked his cigar, that they were not\nline officers on duty at the front, and that they were delighted at it.\n\nNot that there was any scorn apparent in their manner, but there was a\ncertain self-satisfied tranquillity, founded partly on money and partly\non their close intimacy with generals, a certain consciousness of\nsuperiority which even extended to a desire to hide it.\n\nA thick-lipped young doctor and an officer of artillery, with a German\ncast of countenance, were seated almost on the feet of the young\nofficer who was sleeping on the sofa, and counting over their money.\n\nThere were four officers\' servants, some dozing and others busy with\nthe trunks and packages near the door.\n\nAmong all these faces, Kozeltzoff did not find a single familiar\none; but he began to listen with curiosity to the conversation. The\nyoung officers, who, as he decided from their looks alone, had but\njust come out of the military academy, pleased him, and, what was the\nprincipal point, they reminded him that his brother had also come from\nthe academy, and should have joined recently one of the batteries of\nSevastopol.\n\nBut the officer with the satchel, whose face he had seen before\nsomewhere, seemed bold and repulsive to him. He even left the window,\nand, going to the stove-bench, seated himself on it, with the thought\nthat he would put the fellow down if he took it into his head to say\nanything. In general, purely as a brave "line" officer, he did not like\n"the staff," such as he had recognized these two officers to be at the\nfirst glance.\n\n\nIV.\n\n"But this is dreadfully annoying," said one of the young officers, "to\nbe so near, and yet not be able to get there. Perhaps there will be an\naction this very day, and we shall not be there."\n\nIn the sharp voice and the mottled freshness of the color that swept\nacross the youthful face of this officer as he spoke there was apparent\nthe sweet young timidity of the man who is constantly afraid lest his\nevery word shall not turn out exactly right.\n\nThe one-armed officer glanced at him with a smile.\n\n"You will get there soon enough, I assure you," he said.\n\nThe young officer looked with respect at the haggard face of the\narmless officer, so unexpectedly illuminated by a smile, held his peace\nfor a while, and busied himself once more with his tea. In fact, the\none-armed officer\'s face, his attitude, and, most of all, the empty\nsleeve of his coat, expressed much of that tranquil indifference that\nmay be explained in this way--that he looked upon every conversation and\nevery occurrence as though saying, "That is all very fine; I know all\nabout that, and I can do a little of that myself, if I only choose."\n\n"What is our decision to be?" said the young officer again to his\ncompanion in the short coat. "Shall we pass the night here, or shall we\nproceed with our own horses?"\n\nHis comrade declined to proceed.\n\n"Just imagine, captain," said the one who was pouring the tea, turning\nto the one-armed man, and picking up the knife that the latter had\ndropped, "they told us that horses were frightfully dear in Sevastopol,\nso we bought a horse in partnership at Simferopol."\n\n"They made you pay pretty high for it, I fancy."\n\n"Really, I do not know, captain; we paid ninety rubles for it and the\nteam. Is that very dear?" he added, turning to all the company, and to\nKozeltzoff, who was staring at him.\n\n"It was not dear, if the horse is young," said Kozeltzoff.\n\n"Really! but they told us that it was dear. Only, she limps a little,\nbut that will pass off. They told us that she was very strong."\n\n"What academy are you from?" asked Kozeltzoff, who wished to inquire\nfor his brother.\n\n"We are just from the academy of the nobility; there are six of us, and\nwe are on our way to Sevastopol at our own desire," said the talkative\nyoung officer. "But we do not know where our battery is; some say that\nit is in Sevastopol, others that it is at Odessa."\n\n"Was it not possible to find out at Simferopol?" asked Kozeltzoff.\n\n"They do not know there. Just imagine, one of our comrades went to\nthe headquarters there, and they were impertinent to him. You can\nimagine how disagreeable that was! Would you like to have me make you\na cigarette," he said at that moment to the one-armed officer, who was\njust pulling out his cigarette-machine.\n\nHe waited on the latter with a sort of servile enthusiasm.\n\n"And are you from Sevastopol also?" he went on. "Oh, good Heavens,\nhow wonderful that is! How much we did think of you, and of all our\nheroes, in Petersburg," he said, turning to Kozeltzoff with respect and\ngood-natured flattery.\n\n"And now, perhaps, you may have to go back?" inquired the lieutenant.\n\n"That is just what we are afraid of. You can imagine that, after having\nbought the horse, and provided ourselves with all the necessaries,--a\ncoffee-pot with a spirit-lamp, and other indispensable trifles,--we\nhave no money left," he said, in a low voice, as he glanced at his\ncompanions; "so that, if we do have to go back, we don\'t know what is\nto be done."\n\n"Have you received no money for travelling expenses?" inquired\nKozeltzoff.\n\n"No," replied he, in a whisper; "they only promised to give it to us\nhere."\n\n"Have you the certificate?"\n\n"I know that--the principal thing--is the certificate; but a senator in\nMoscow,--he\'s my uncle,--when I was at his house, said that they would\ngive it to us here; otherwise, he would have given me some himself. So\nthey will give it to us here?"\n\n"Most certainly they will."\n\n"I too think that they will," he said, in a tone which showed\nthat, after having made the same identical inquiry in thirty\nposting-stations, and having everywhere received different answers, he\nno longer believed any one implicitly.\n\n\nV.\n\n"Who ordered beet-soup?" called out the slatternly mistress of the\nhouse, a fat woman of forty, as she entered the room with a bowl of\nsoup.\n\nThe conversation ceased at once, and all who were in the room fixed\ntheir eyes on the woman.\n\n"Ah, it was Kozeltzoff who ordered it," said the young officer. "He\nmust be waked. Get up for your dinner," he said, approaching the\nsleeper on the sofa, and jogging his elbow.\n\nA young lad of seventeen, with merry black eyes and red cheeks, sprang\nenergetically from the sofa, and stood in the middle of the room,\nrubbing his eyes.\n\n"Ah, excuse me, please," he said to the doctor, whom he had touched in\nrising.\n\nLieutenant Kozeltzoff recognized his brother immediately, and stepped\nup to him.\n\n"Don\'t you know me?" he said with a smile.\n\n"A-a-a-!" exclaimed the younger brother; "this is astonishing!" And he\nbegan to kiss his brother.\n\nThey kissed twice, but stopped at the third repetition as though the\nthought had occurred to both of them:--\n\n"Why is it necessary to do it exactly three times?"\n\n"Well, how delighted I am!" said the elder, looking at his brother.\n"Let us go out on the porch; we can have a talk."\n\n"Come, come, I don\'t want any soup. You eat it, Federsohn!" he said to\nhis comrade.\n\n"But you wanted something to eat."\n\n"I don\'t want anything."\n\nWhen they emerged on the porch, the younger kept asking his brother:\n"Well, how are you; tell me all about it." And still he kept on saying\nhow glad he was to see him, but he told nothing himself.\n\nWhen five minutes had elapsed, during which time they had succeeded in\nbecoming somewhat silent, the elder brother inquired why the younger\nhad not gone into the guards, as they had all expected him to do.\n\nHe wanted to get to Sevastopol as speedily as possible, he said; for\nif things turned out favorably there, he could get advancement more\nrapidly there than in the guards. There it takes ten years to reach\nthe grade of colonel, while here Todleben had risen in two years from\nlieutenant-colonel to general. Well, and if one did get killed, there\nwas nothing to be done.\n\n"What a fellow you are!" said his brother, smiling.\n\n"But the principal thing, do you know, brother," said the younger,\nsmiling and blushing as though he were preparing to say something\nvery disgraceful, "all this is nonsense, and the principal reason why\nI asked it was that I was ashamed to live in Petersburg when men are\ndying for their country here. Yes, and I wanted to be with you," he\nadded, with still greater shamefacedness.\n\n"How absurd you are!" said the elder brother, pulling out his\ncigarette-machine, and not even glancing at him. "It\'s a pity, though,\nthat we can\'t be together."\n\n"Now, honestly, is it so terrible in the bastions?" inquired the\nyounger man, abruptly.\n\n"It is terrible at first, but you get used to it afterwards. It\'s\nnothing. You will see for yourself."\n\n"And tell me still another thing. What do you think?--will Sevastopol be\ntaken? I think that it will not."\n\n"God knows!"\n\n"But one thing is annoying. Just imagine what bad luck! A whole bundle\nwas stolen from us on the road, and it had my shako in it, so that\nnow I am in a dreadful predicament; and I don\'t know how I am to show\nmyself."\n\nThe younger Kozeltzoff, Vladimir, greatly resembled his brother\nMikhail, but he resembled him as a budding rose-bush resembles one\nthat is out of flower. His hair was chestnut also, but it was thick\nand lay in curls on his temples. On the soft white back of his neck\nthere was a blond lock; a sign of good luck, so the nurses say. The\nfull-blooded crimson of youth did not stand fixed on the soft, white\nhue of his face, but flashed up and betrayed all the movements of his\nmind. He had the same eyes as his brother, but they were more widely\nopened, and clearer, which appeared the more peculiar because they were\nveiled frequently by a slight moisture. A golden down was sprouting\non his cheeks, and over his ruddy lips, which were often folded into\na shy smile, displaying teeth of dazzling whiteness. He was a well\nformed and broad-shouldered fellow, in unbuttoned coat, from beneath\nwhich was visible a red shirt with collar turned back. As he stood\nbefore his brother, leaning his elbows on the railing of the porch,\nwith cigarette in hand and innocent joy in his face and gesture, he was\nso agreeable and comely a youth that any one would have gazed at him\nwith delight. He was extremely pleased with his brother, he looked at\nhim with respect and pride, fancying him his hero; but in some ways, so\nfar as judgments on worldly culture, ability to talk French, behavior\nin the society of distinguished people, dancing, and so on, he was\nsomewhat ashamed of him, looked down on him, and even cherished a hope\nof improving him if such a thing were possible.\n\nAll his impressions, so far, were from Petersburg, at the house of\na lady who was fond of good-looking young fellows, and who had had\nhim spend his holidays with her, and from Moscow, at the house of a\nsenator, where he had once danced at a great ball.\n\n\nVI.\n\nHaving nearly talked their fill and having arrived at the feeling that\nyou frequently experience, that there is little in common between you,\nthough you love one another, the brothers were silent for a few moments.\n\n"Pick up your things and we will set out at once," said the elder.\n\nThe younger suddenly blushed, stammered, and became confused.\n\n"Are we to go straight to Sevastopol?" he inquired, after a momentary\npause.\n\n"Why, yes. You can\'t have many things, and we can manage to carry them,\nI think."\n\n"Very good! we will start at once," said the younger, with a sigh, and\nhe went inside.\n\nBut he paused in the vestibule without opening the door, dropped his\nhead gloomily, and began to reflect.\n\n"Straight to Sevastopol, on the instant, within range of the\nbombs--frightful! It\'s no matter, however; it must have come sometime.\nNow, at all events, with my brother--"\n\nThe fact was that it was only now, at the thought that, once seated\nin the cart, he should enter Sevastopol without dismounting from it,\nand that no chance occurrence could any longer detain him, that the\ndanger which he was seeking clearly presented itself to him, and he was\ntroubled at the very thought of its nearness. He managed to control\nhimself in some way, and entered the room; but a quarter of an hour\nelapsed, and still he had not rejoined his brother, so that the latter\nopened the door at last, in order to call him. The younger Kozeltzoff,\nin the attitude of a naughty school-boy, was saying something to an\nofficer named P. When his brother opened the door, he became utterly\nconfused.\n\n"Immediately. I\'ll come out in a minute!" he cried, waving his hand at\nhis brother. "Wait for me there, please."\n\nA moment later he emerged, in fact, and approached his brother, with a\ndeep sigh.\n\n"Just imagine! I cannot go with you, brother," he said.\n\n"What? What nonsense is this?"\n\n"I will tell you the whole truth, Misha! Not one of us has any money,\nand we are all in debt to that staff-captain whom you saw there. It is\nhorribly mortifying!"\n\nThe elder brother frowned, and did not break the silence for a long\nwhile.\n\n"Do you owe much?" he asked, glancing askance at his brother.\n\n"A great deal--no, not a great deal; but I am dreadfully ashamed of it.\nHe has paid for me for three stages, and all his sugar is gone, so that\nI do not know--yes, and we played at preference. I am a little in his\ndebt there, too."\n\n"This is bad, Volodya! Now, what would you have done if you had not met\nme?" said the elder, sternly, without looking at his brother.\n\n"Why, I was thinking, brother, that I should get that travelling-money\nat Sevastopol, and that I would give him that. Surely, that can be\ndone; and it will be better for me to go with him to-morrow."\n\nThe elder brother pulled out his purse, and, with fingers that shook a\nlittle, he took out two ten-ruble notes and one for three rubles.\n\n"This is all the money I have," said he. "How much do you owe?"\n\nKozeltzoff did not speak the exact truth when he said that this was all\nthe money he had. He had, besides, four gold pieces sewn into his cuff,\nin case of an emergency; but he had taken a vow not to touch them.\n\nIt appeared that Kozeltzoff, what with preference and sugar, was in\ndebt to the amount of eight rubles only. The elder brother gave him\nthis sum, merely remarking that one should not play preference when one\nhad no money.\n\n"What did you play for?"\n\nThe younger brother answered not a word. His brother\'s question seemed\nto him to cast a reflection on his honor. Vexation at himself, a shame\nat his conduct, which could give rise to such a suspicion, and the\ninsult from his brother, of whom he was so fond, produced upon his\nsensitive nature so deeply painful an impression that he made no reply.\nSensible that he was not in a condition to restrain the sobs which rose\nin his throat, he took the money without glancing at it, and went back\nto his comrades.\n\n\nVII.\n\nNikolaeff, who had fortified himself at Duvanka, with two jugs of\nvodka, purchased from a soldier who was peddling it on the bridge, gave\nthe reins a jerk, and the team jolted away over the stony road, shaded\nhere and there, which led along the Belbek to Sevastopol; but the\nbrothers, whose legs jostled each other, maintained a stubborn silence,\nalthough they were thinking of each other every instant.\n\n"Why did he insult me?" thought the younger. "Could he not have held\nhis tongue about that? It is exactly as though he thought that I was a\nthief; yes, and now he is angry, apparently, so that we have quarrelled\nfor good. And how splendid it would have been for us to be together in\nSevastopol. Two brothers, on friendly terms, both fighting the foe!\none of them, the elder, though not very cultivated, yet a valiant\nwarrior, and the other younger, but a brave fellow too. In a week\'s\ntime I would have showed them that I am not such a youngster after all!\nI shall cease to blush, there will be manliness in my countenance,\nand, though my moustache is not very large now, it would grow to a\ngood size by that time;" and he felt of the down which was making its\nappearance round the edges of his mouth. "Perhaps we shall arrive\nto-day, and get directly into the conflict, my brother and I. He must\nbe obstinate and very brave, one of those who do not say much, but act\nbetter than others. I should like to know," he continued, "whether he\nis squeezing me against the side of the wagon on purpose or not. He\nprobably is conscious that I feel awkward, and he is pretending not\nto notice me. We shall arrive to-day," he went on with his argument,\npressing close to the side of the wagon, and fearing to move lest his\nbrother should observe that he was uncomfortable, "and, all at once,\nwe shall go straight to the bastion. We shall both go together, I with\nmy equipments, and my brother with his company. All of a sudden, the\nFrench throw themselves on us. I begin to fire, and fire on them. I\nkill a terrible number; but they still continue to run straight at me.\nNow, it is impossible to fire any longer, and there is no hope for me;\nall at once my brother rushes out in front with his sword, and I grasp\nmy gun, and we rush on with the soldiers. The French throw themselves\non my brother. I hasten up; I kill one Frenchman, then another, and\nI save my brother. I am wounded in one arm; I seize my gun with the\nother, and continue my flight; but my brother is slain by my side by\nthe bullets. I halt for a moment, and gaze at him so sorrowfully; then\nI straighten myself up and shout: \'Follow me! We will avenge him! I\nloved my brother more than any one in the world,\' I shall say, \'and I\nhave lost him. Let us avenge him! Let us annihilate the foe, or let us\nall die together there!\' All shout, and fling themselves after me. Then\nthe whole French army makes a sortie, including even Pelissier himself.\nWe all fight; but, at last, I am wounded a second, a third time, and I\nfall, nearly dead. Then, all rush up to me. Gortchakoff comes up and\nasks what I would like. I say that I want nothing--except that I may\nbe laid beside my brother; that I wish to die with him. They carry\nme, and lay me down by the side of my brother\'s bloody corpse. Then I\nshall raise myself, and merely say: \'Yes, you did not understand how\nto value two men who really loved their father-land; now they have both\nfallen,--and may God forgive you!\' and I shall die.\n\nWho knows in what measure these dreams will be realized?\n\n"Have you ever been in a hand to hand fight?" he suddenly inquired of\nhis brother, quite forgetting that he had not meant to speak to him.\n\n"No, not once," answered the elder. "Our regiment has lost two thousand\nmen, all on the works; and I, also, was wounded there. War is not\ncarried on in the least as you fancy, Volodya."\n\nThe word "Volodya" touched the younger brother. He wanted to come to an\nexplanation with his brother, who had not the least idea that he had\noffended Volodya.\n\n"You are not angry with me, Misha?" he said, after a momentary silence.\n\n"What about?"\n\n"No, because--because we had such a--nothing."\n\n"Not in the least," replied the elder, turning to him, and slapping him\non the leg.\n\n"Then forgive me, Misha, if I have wounded you."\n\nAnd the younger brother turned aside, in order to hide the tears that\nsuddenly started to his eyes.\n\n\nVIII.\n\n"Is this Sevastopol already?" asked the younger brother, as they\nascended the hill.\n\nAnd before them appeared the bay, with its masts of ships, its\nshipping, and the sea, with the hostile fleet, in the distance; the\nwhite batteries on the shore, the barracks, the aqueducts, the docks\nand the buildings of the town, and the white and lilac clouds of smoke\nrising incessantly over the yellow hills, which surrounded the town and\nstood out against the blue sky, in the rosy rays of the sun, which was\nreflected by the waves, and sinking towards the horizon of the shadowy\nsea.\n\nVolodya, without a shudder, gazed upon this terrible place of which\nhe had thought so much; on the contrary, he did so with an aesthetic\nenjoyment, and a heroic sense of self-satisfaction at the idea that\nhere he was--he would be there in another half-hour, that he would\nbehold that really charmingly original spectacle--and he stared with\nconcentrated attention from that moment until they arrived at the north\nfortification, at the baggage-train of his brother\'s regiment, where\nthey were to ascertain with certainty the situations of the regiment\nand the battery.\n\nThe officer in charge of the train lived near the so-called new town\n(huts built of boards by the sailors\' families), in a tent, connecting\nwith a tolerably large shed, constructed out of green oak-boughs, that\nwere not yet entirely withered.\n\nThe brothers found the officer seated before a greasy table, upon which\nstood a glass of cold tea, a tray with vodka, crumbs of dry sturgeon\nroe, and bread, clad only in a shirt of a dirty yellow hue, and engaged\nin counting a huge pile of bank-bills on a large abacus.\n\nBut before describing the personality of the officer, and his\nconversation, it is indispensable that we should inspect with more\nattention the interior of his shed, and become a little acquainted, at\nleast, with his mode of life and his occupations. The new shed, like\nthose built for generals and regimental commanders, was large, closely\nwattled, and comfortably arranged, with little tables and benches, made\nof turf. The sides and roof were hung with three rugs, to keep the\nleaves from showering down, and, though extremely ugly, they were new,\nand certainly costly.\n\nUpon the iron bed, which stood beneath the principal rug, with a young\namazon depicted on it, lay a plush coverlet, of a brilliant crimson,\na torn and dirty pillow, and a raccoon cloak. On the table stood a\nmirror, in a silver frame, a silver brush, frightfully dirty, a broken\nhorn comb, full of greasy hair, a silver candlestick, a bottle of\nliqueur, with a huge gold and red label, a gold watch, with a portrait\nof Peter I., two gold pens, a small box, containing pills of some sort,\na crust of bread, and some old, castaway cards, and there were bottles,\nboth full and empty, under the bed.\n\nThis officer had charge of the commissariat of the regiment and the\nfodder of the horses. With him lived his great friend, the commissioner\nwho had charge of the operations.\n\nAt the moment when the brothers entered, the latter was asleep in\nthe booth, and the commissary officer was making up his accounts of\nthe government money, in anticipation of the end of the month. The\ncommissary officer had a very comely and warlike exterior. His stature\nwas tall, his moustache huge, and he possessed a respectable amount\nof plumpness. The only disagreeable points about him were a certain\nperspiration and puffiness of the whole face, which almost concealed\nhis small gray eyes (as though he was filled up with porter), and an\nexcessive lack of cleanliness, from his thin, greasy hair to his big,\nbare feet, thrust into some sort of ermine slippers.\n\n"Money, money!" said Kozeltzoff number one, entering the shed, and\nfixing his eyes, with involuntary greed, upon the pile of bank-notes.\n"You might lend me half of that, Vasily Mikhailitch!"\n\nThe commissary officer cringed at the sight of his visitors, and,\nsweeping up his money, he bowed to them without rising.\n\n"Oh, if it only belonged to me! It\'s government money, my dear fellow.\nAnd who is this you have with you?" said he, thrusting the money into a\ncoffer which stood beside him, and staring at Volodya.\n\n"This is my brother, who has just come from the military academy. We\nhave both come to learn from you where our regiment is stationed."\n\n"Sit down, gentlemen," said the officer, rising, and going into the\nshed, without paying any heed to his guests. "Won\'t you have something\nto drink? Some porter, for instance?" said he.\n\n"Don\'t put yourself out, Vasily Mikhailitch."\n\nVolodya was impressed by the size of the commissary officer, by his\ncarelessness of manner, and by the respect with which his brother\naddressed him.\n\n"It must be that this is one of their very fine officers, whom every\none respects. Really, he is simple, but hospitable and brave," he\nthought, seating himself in a timid and modest manner on the sofa.\n\n"Where is our regiment stationed, then?" called out his elder brother\ninto the board hut.\n\n"What?"\n\nHe repeated his query.\n\n"Zeifer has been here to-day. He told me that they had removed to the\nfifth bastion."\n\n"Is that true?"\n\n"If I say so, it must be true; but the deuce only knows anyway! He\nwould think nothing of telling a lie. Won\'t you have some porter?" said\nthe commissary officer, still from the tent.\n\n"I will if you please," said Kozeltzoff.\n\n"And will you have a drink, Osip Ignatievitch?" went on the voice in\nthe tent, apparently addressing the sleeping commissioner. "You have\nslept enough; it\'s five o\'clock."\n\n"Why do you worry me? I am not asleep," answered a shrill, languid\nlittle voice.\n\n"Come, get up! we find it stupid without you."\n\nAnd the commissary officer came out to his guests.\n\n"Fetch some Simferopol porter!" he shouted.\n\nA servant entered the booth, with a haughty expression of countenance,\nas it seemed to Volodya, and, having jostled Volodya, he drew forth the\nporter from beneath the bench.\n\nThe bottle of porter was soon emptied, and the conversation had\nproceeded in the same style for rather a long time when the flap of\nthe tent flew open and out stepped a short, fresh-colored man, in a\nblue dressing-gown with tassels, in a cap with a red rim and a cockade.\nAt the moment of his appearance, he was smoothing his small black\nmoustache, and, with his gaze fixed on the rugs, he replied to the\ngreetings of the officer with a barely perceptible movement of the\nshoulders.\n\n"I will drink a small glassful too!" said he, seating himself by the\ntable. "What is this, have you come from Petersburg, young man?" he\nsaid, turning courteously to Volodya.\n\n"Yes, sir, I am on my way to Sevastopol."\n\n"Did you make the application yourself?"\n\n"Yes, sir."\n\n"What queer tastes you have, gentlemen! I do not understand it!"\ncontinued the commissioner. "It strikes me that I should be ready just\nnow to travel on foot to Petersburg, if I could get away. By Heavens, I\nam tired of this cursed life!"\n\n"What is there about it that does not suit you?" said the elder\nKozeltzoff, turning to him. "You\'re the very last person to complain of\nlife here!"\n\nThe commissioner cast a look upon him, and then turned away.\n\n"This danger, these privations, it is impossible to get anything\nhere," he continued, addressing Volodya. "And why you should take\nsuch a freak, gentlemen, I really cannot understand. If there were any\nadvantages to be derived from it, but there is nothing of the sort. It\nwould be a nice thing, now, wouldn\'t it, if you, at your age, were to\nbe left a cripple for life!"\n\n"Some need the money, and some serve for honor\'s sake!" said the elder\nKozeltzoff, in a tone of vexation, joining the discussion once more.\n\n"What\'s the good of honor, when there\'s nothing to eat!" said the\ncommissioner with a scornful laugh, turning to the commissary, who also\nlaughed at this. "Give us something from \'Lucia\'; we will listen," he\nsaid, pointing to the music-box. "I love it."\n\n"Well, is that Vasily Mikhailitch a fine man?" Volodya asked his\nbrother when they emerged, at dusk, from the booth, and pursued their\nway to Sevastopol.\n\n"Not at all; but such a niggard that it is a perfect terror! And I\ncan\'t bear the sight of that commissioner, and I shall give him a\nthrashing one of these days."\n\n\nIX.\n\nVolodya was not precisely out of sorts when, nearly at nightfall,\nthey reached the great bridge over the bay, but he felt a certain\nheaviness at his heart. All that he had heard and seen was so little\nin consonance with the impressions which had recently passed away; the\nhuge, light examination hall, with its polished floor, the kind and\nmerry voices and laughter of his comrades, the new uniform, his beloved\ntsar, whom he had been accustomed to see for the last seven years, and\nwho, when he took leave of them, had called them his children, with\ntears in his eyes,--and everything that he had seen so little resembled\nhis very beautiful, rainbow-hued, magnificent dreams.\n\n"Well, here we are at last!" said the elder brother, when they arrived\nat the Mikhailovsky battery, and dismounted from their cart. "If\nthey let us pass the bridge, we will go directly to the Nikolaevsky\nbarracks. You stay there until morning, and I will go to the regiment\nand find out where your battery is stationed, and to-morrow I will come\nfor you."\n\n"But why? It would be better if we both went together," said Volodya;\n"I will go to the bastion with you. It won\'t make any difference; I\nshall have to get used to it. If you go, then I can too."\n\n"Better not go."\n\n"No, if you please; I do know, at least, that...."\n\n"My advice is, not to go; but if you choose...."\n\nThe sky was clear and dark; the stars, and the fires of the bombs\nin incessant movement and discharges, were gleaming brilliantly\nthrough the gloom. The large white building of the battery, and the\nbeginning of the bridge stood out in the darkness. Literally, every\nsecond several discharges of artillery and explosions, following each\nother in quick succession or occurring simultaneously, shook the air\nwith increasing thunder and distinctness. Through this roar, and as\nthough repeating it, the melancholy dash of the waves was audible. A\nfaint breeze was drawing in from the sea, and the air was heavy with\nmoisture. The brothers stepped upon the bridge. A soldier struck his\ngun awkwardly against his arm, and shouted:--\n\n"Who goes there?"\n\n"A soldier."\n\n"The orders are not to let any one pass!"\n\n"What of that! We have business! We must pass!"\n\n"Ask the officer."\n\nThe officer, who was drowsing as he sat on an anchor, rose up and gave\nthe order to let them pass.\n\n"You can go that way, but not this. Where are you driving to, all in a\nheap!" he cried to the transport wagons piled high with gabions, which\nhad clustered about the entrance.\n\nAs they descended to the first pontoon, the brothers encountered\nsoldiers who were coming thence, and talking loudly.\n\n"If he has received his ammunition money, then he has squared his\naccounts in full--that\'s what it is!"\n\n"Eh, brothers!" said another voice, "when you get over on the\nSevernaya you will see the world, by heavens! The air is entirely\ndifferent."\n\n"You may say more!" said the first speaker. "A cursed shell flew in\nthere the other day, and it tore the legs off of two sailors, so\nthat...."\n\nThe brothers traversed the first pontoon, while waiting for the wagon,\nand halted on the second, which was already flooded with water in\nparts. The breeze, which had seemed weak inland, was very powerful\nhere, and came in gusts; the bridge swayed to and fro, and the waves,\nbeating noisily against the beams, and tearing at the cables and\nanchors, flooded the planks. At the right the gloomily hostile sea\nroared and darkled, as it lay separated by an interminable level black\nline from the starry horizon, which was light gray in its gleam; lights\nflashed afar on the enemy\'s fleet; on the left towered the black\nmasts of one of our vessels, and the waves could be heard as they\nbeat against her hull; a steamer was visible, as it moved noisily and\nswiftly from the Severnaya.\n\nThe flash of a bomb, as it burst near it, illuminated for a moment\nthe lofty heaps of gabions on the deck, two men who were standing\non it, and the white foam and the spurts of greenish waves, as the\nsteamer ploughed through them. On the edge of the bridge, with his\nlegs dangling in the water, sat a man in his shirt-sleeves, who\nwas repairing something connected with the bridge. In front, over\nSevastopol, floated the same fires, and the terrible sounds grew louder\nand louder. A wave rolled in from the sea, flowed over the right side\nof the bridge, and wet Volodya\'s feet; two soldiers passed them,\ndragging their feet through the water. Something suddenly burst with a\ncrash and lighted up the bridge ahead of them, the wagon driving over\nit, and a man on horseback. The splinters fell into the waves with a\nhiss, and sent up the water in splashes.\n\n"Ah, Mikhailo Semyonitch!" said the rider, stopping, reining in his\nhorse in front of the elder Kozeltzoff, "have you fully recovered\nalready?"\n\n"As you see. Whither is God taking you?"\n\n"To the Severnaya, for cartridges; I am on my way to the adjutant of\nthe regiment ... we expect an assault to-morrow, at any hour."\n\n"And where is Martzoff?"\n\n"He lost a leg yesterday; he was in the town, asleep in his room....\nPerhaps you know it?"\n\n"The regiment is in the fifth bastion, isn\'t it?"\n\n"Yes; it has taken the place of the M---- regiment. Go to the\nfield-hospital; some of our men are there, and they will show you the\nway."\n\n"Well, and are my quarters on the Morskaya still intact?"\n\n"Why, my good fellow, they were smashed to bits long ago by the bombs.\nYou will not recognize Sevastopol now; there\'s not a single woman there\nnow, nor any inns nor music; the last establishment took its departure\nyesterday. It has become horribly dismal there now.... Farewell!"\n\nAnd the officer rode on his way at a trot.\n\nAll at once, Volodya became terribly frightened; it seemed to him\nas though a cannon-ball or a splinter of bomb would fly in their\ndirection, and strike him directly on the head. This damp darkness,\nall these sounds, especially the angry splashing of the waves, seemed\nto be saying to him that he ought not to go any farther, that nothing\ngood awaited him yonder, that he would never again set foot on the\nground upon this side of the bay, that he must turn about at once, and\nflee somewhere or other, as far as possible from this terrible haunt\nof death. "But perhaps it is too late now, everything is settled,"\nthought he, trembling partly at this thought and partly because the\nwater had soaked through his boots and wet his feet.\n\nVolodya heaved a deep sigh, and went a little apart from his brother.\n\n"Lord, will they kill me--me in particular? Lord, have mercy on me!"\nsaid he, in a whisper, and he crossed himself.\n\n"Come, Volodya, let us go on!" said the elder brother, when their\nlittle cart had driven upon the bridge. "Did you see that bomb?"\n\nOn the bridge, the brothers met wagons filled with the wounded, with\ngabions, and one loaded with furniture, which was driven by a woman. On\nthe further side no one detained them.\n\nClinging instinctively to the walls of the Nikolaevsky battery, the\nbrothers listened in silence to the noise of the bombs, exploding\noverhead, and to the roar of the fragments, showering down from above,\nand came to that spot in the battery where the image was. There they\nlearned that the fifth light battery, to which Volodya had been\nassigned, was stationed on the Korabelnaya, and they decided that he\nshould go, in spite of the danger, and pass the night with the elder\nin the fifth bastion, and that he should from there join his battery\nthe next day. They turned into the corridor, stepping over the legs\nof the sleeping soldiers, who were lying all along the walls of the\nbattery, and at last they arrived at the place where the wounded were\nattended to.\n\n\nX.\n\nAs they entered the first room, surrounded with cots on which lay the\nwounded, and permeated with that frightful and disgusting hospital\nodor, they met two Sisters of Mercy, who were coming to meet them.\n\nOne woman, of fifty, with black eyes, and a stern expression of\ncountenance, was carrying bandages and lint, and was giving strict\norders to a young fellow, an assistant surgeon, who was following her;\nthe other, a very pretty girl of twenty, with a pale and delicate\nlittle fair face, gazed in an amiably helpless way from beneath her\nwhite cap, held her hands in the pockets of her apron, as she walked\nbeside the elder woman, and seemed to be afraid to quit her side.\n\nKozeltzoff addressed to them the question whether they knew where\nMartzoff was--the man whose leg had been torn off on the day before.\n\n"He belonged to the P---- regiment, did he not?" inquired the elder. "Is\nhe a relative of yours?"\n\n"No, a comrade."\n\n"Show them the way," said she, in French, to the young sister. "Here,\nthis way," and she approached a wounded man, in company with the\nassistant.\n\n"Come along; what are you staring at?" said Kozeltzoff to Volodya,\nwho, with uplifted eyebrows and somewhat suffering expression of\ncountenance, could not tear himself away, but continued to stare at the\nwounded. "Come, let us go."\n\nVolodya went off with his brother, still continuing to gaze about him,\nhowever, and repeating unconsciously:--\n\n"Ah, my God! Ah, my God!"\n\n"He has probably not been here long?" inquired the sister of\nKozeltzoff, pointing at Volodya, who, groaning and sighing, followed\nthem through the corridor.\n\n"He has but just arrived."\n\nThe pretty little sister glanced at Volodya, and suddenly burst out\ncrying. "My God! my God! when will there be an end to all this?"\nshe said, with the accents of despair. They entered the officer\'s\nhut. Martzoff was lying on his back, with his muscular arms, bare\nto the elbow, thrown over his head, and with the expression on his\nyellow face of a man who is clenching his teeth in order to keep from\nshrieking with pain. His whole leg, in its stocking, was thrust outside\nthe coverlet, and it could be seen how he was twitching his toes\nconvulsively inside it.\n\n"Well, how goes it, how do you feel?" asked the sister, raising his\nbald head with her slender, delicate fingers, on one of which Volodya\nnoticed a gold ring, and arranging his pillow. "Here are some of your\ncomrades come to inquire after you."\n\n"Badly, of course," he answered, angrily. "Let me alone! it\'s all\nright,"--the toes in his stocking moved more rapidly than ever.\n"How do you do? What is your name? Excuse me," he said, turning to\nKozeltzoff.... "Ah, yes, I beg your pardon! one forgets everything\nhere," he said, when the latter had mentioned his name. "You and\nI lived together," he added, without the slightest expression of\npleasure, glancing interrogatively at Volodya.\n\n"This is my brother, who has just arrived from Petersburg to-day."\n\n"Hm! Here I have finished my service," he said, with a frown. "Ah, how\npainful it is!... The best thing would be a speedy end."\n\nHe drew up his leg, and covered his face with his hands, continuing to\nmove his toes with redoubled swiftness.\n\n"You must leave him," said the sister, in a whisper, while the tears\nstood in her eyes; "he is in a very bad state."\n\nThe brothers had already decided on the north side to go to the fifth\nbastion; but, on emerging from the Nikolaevsky battery, they seemed\nto have come to a tacit understanding not to subject themselves\nto unnecessary danger, and, without discussing the subject, they\ndetermined to go their ways separately.\n\n"Only, how are you to find your way, Volodya?" said the elder.\n"However, Nikolaeff will conduct you to the Korabelnaya, and I will go\nmy way alone, and will be with you to-morrow."\n\nNothing more was said at this last leave-taking between the brothers.\n\n\nXI.\n\nThe thunder of the cannon continued with the same power as before, but\nYekaterinskaya street, along which Volodya walked, followed by the\ntaciturn Nikolaeff, was quiet and deserted. All that he could see,\nthrough the thick darkness, was the wide street with the white walls of\nlarge houses, battered in many places, and the stone sidewalk beneath\nhis feet; now and then, he met soldiers and officers. As he passed\nalong the left side of the street, near the Admiralty building, he\nperceived, by the light of a bright fire burning behind the wall, the\nacacias planted along the sidewalk, with green guards beneath, and the\nwretchedly dusty leaves of these acacias.\n\nHe could plainly hear his own steps and those of Nikolaeff, who\nfollowed him, breathing heavily. He thought of nothing; the pretty\nlittle Sister of Mercy, Martzoff\'s leg with the toes twitching in its\nstocking, the bombs, the darkness, and divers pictures of death floated\nhazily through his mind. All his young and sensitive soul shrank\ntogether, and was borne down by his consciousness of loneliness, and\nthe indifference of every one to his fate in the midst of danger.\n\n"They will kill me, I shall be tortured, I shall suffer, and no one\nwill weep." And all this, instead of the hero\'s life, filled with\nenergy and sympathy, of which he had cherished such glorious dreams.\nThe bombs burst and shrieked nearer and ever nearer. Nikolaeff sighed\nmore frequently, without breaking the silence. On crossing the bridge\nleading to the Korabelnaya, he saw something fly screaming into the\nbay, not far from him, which lighted up the lilac waves for an instant\nwith a crimson glow, then disappeared, and threw on high a cloud of\nfoam.\n\n"See there, it was not put out!" said Nikolaeff, hoarsely.\n\n"Yes," answered Volodya, involuntarily, and quite unexpectedly to\nhimself, in a thin, piping voice.\n\nThey encountered litters with wounded men, then more regimental\ntransports with gabions; they met a regiment on Korabelnaya street;\nmen on horseback passed them. One of them was an officer, with his\nCossack. He was riding at a trot, but, on catching sight of Volodya, he\nreined in his horse near him, looked into his face, turned and rode on,\ngiving the horse a blow of his whip.\n\n"Alone, alone; it is nothing to any one whether I am in existence or\nnot," thought the lad, and he felt seriously inclined to cry.\n\nAfter ascending the hill, past a high white wall, he entered a street\nof small ruined houses, incessantly illuminated by bombs. A drunken and\ndishevelled woman, who was coming out of a small door in company with a\nsailor, ran against him.\n\n"If he were only a fine man," she grumbled,--"Pardon, Your Honor the\nofficer."\n\nThe poor boy\'s heart sank lower and lower, and more and more frequently\nflashed the lightnings against the dark horizon, and the bombs\nscreamed and burst about him with ever increasing frequency. Nikolaeff\nsighed, and all at once he began to speak, in what seemed to Volodya a\nfrightened and constrained tone.\n\n"What haste we made to get here from home. It was nothing but\ntravelling. A pretty place to be in a hurry to get to!"\n\n"What was to be done, if my brother was well again," replied Volodya,\nin hope that he might banish by conversation the frightful feeling that\nwas taking possession of him.\n\n"Well, what sort of health is it when he is thoroughly ill! Those who\nare really well had better stay in the hospital at such a time. A\nvast deal of joy there is about it, isn\'t there? You will have a leg\nor an arm torn off, and that\'s all you will get! It\'s not far removed\nfrom a downright sin! And here in the town it\'s not at all like the\nbastion, and that is a perfect terror. You go and you say your prayers\nthe whole way. Eh, you beast, there you go whizzing past!" he added,\ndirecting his attention to the sound of a splinter of shell whizzing\nby near them. "Now, here," Nikolaeff went on, "I was ordered to show\nYour Honor the way. My business, of course, is to do as I am bid; but\nthe cart has been abandoned to some wretch of a soldier, and the bundle\nis undone.... Go on and on; but if any of the property disappears,\nNikolaeff will have to answer for it."\n\nAfter proceeding a few steps further, they came out on a square.\nNikolaeff held his peace, but sighed.\n\n"Yonder is your artillery, Your Honor!" he suddenly said. "Ask the\nsentinel; he will show you."\n\nAnd Volodya, after he had taken a few steps more, ceased to hear the\nsound of Nikolaeff\'s sighs behind him.\n\nAll at once, he felt himself entirely and finally alone. This\nconsciousness of solitude in danger, before death, as it seemed to him,\nlay upon his heart like a terribly cold and heavy stone.\n\nHe halted in the middle of the square, glanced about him, to see\nwhether he could catch sight of any one, grasped his head, and uttered\nhis thought aloud in his terror:--"Lord! Can it be that I am a coward,\na vile, disgusting, worthless coward ... can it be that I so lately\ndreamed of dying with joy for my father-land, my tsar? No, I am a\nwretched, an unfortunate, a wretched being!" And Volodya, with a\ngenuine sentiment of despair and disenchantment with himself, inquired\nof the sentinel for the house of the commander of the battery, and set\nout in the direction indicated.\n\n\nXII.\n\nThe residence of the commander of the battery, which the sentinel had\npointed out to him, was a small, two-story house, with an entrance\non the court-yard. In one of the windows, which was pasted over with\npaper, burned the feeble flame of a candle. A servant was seated on\nthe porch, smoking his pipe; he went in and announced Volodya to the\ncommander, and then led him in. In the room, between the two windows,\nand beneath a shattered mirror, stood a table, heaped with official\ndocuments, several chairs, and an iron bedstead, with a clean pallet,\nand a small bed-rug by its side.\n\nNear the door stood a handsome man, with a large moustache,--a sergeant,\nin sabre and cloak, on the latter of which hung a cross and a Hungarian\nmedal. Back and forth in the middle of the room paced a short\nstaff-officer of forty, with swollen cheeks bound up, and dressed in a\nthin old coat.\n\n"I have the honor to report myself, Cornet Kozeltzoff, 2d, ordered to\nthe fifth light battery," said Volodya, uttering the phrase which he\nhad learned by heart, as he entered the room.\n\nThe commander of the battery responded dryly to his greeting, and,\nwithout offering his hand, invited him to be seated.\n\nVolodya dropped timidly into a chair, beside the writing-table, and\nbegan to twist in his fingers the scissors, which his hand happened\nto light upon. The commander of the battery put his hands behind his\nback, and, dropping his head, pursued his walk up and down the room, in\nsilence, only bestowing an occasional glance at the hands which were\ntwirling the scissors, with the aspect of a man who is trying to recall\nsomething.\n\nThe battery commander was a rather stout man, with a large bald spot\non the crown of his head, a thick moustache, which drooped straight\ndown and concealed his mouth, and pleasant brown eyes. His hands were\nhandsome, clean, and plump; his feet small and well turned, and they\nstepped out in a confident and rather dandified manner, proving that\nthe commander was not a timid man.\n\n"Yes," he said, coming to a halt in front of the sergeant; "a measure\nmust be added to the grain to-morrow, or our horses will be getting\nthin. What do you think?"\n\n"Of course, it is possible to do so, Your Excellency! Oats are very\ncheap just now," replied the sergeant, twitching his fingers, which\nhe held on the seams of his trousers, but which evidently liked to\nassist in the conversation. "Our forage-master, Franchuk, sent me a\nnote yesterday, from the transports, Your Excellency, saying that we\nshould certainly be obliged to purchase oats; they say they are cheap.\nTherefore, what are your orders?"\n\n"To buy, of course. He has money, surely." And the commander resumed\nhis tramp through the room. "And where are your things?" he suddenly\ninquired of Volodya, as he paused in front of him.\n\nPoor Volodya was so overwhelmed by the thought that he was a coward,\nthat he espied scorn for himself in every glance, in every word, as\nthough they had been addressed to a pitiable poltroon. It seemed to him\nthat the commander of the battery had already divined his secret, and\nwas making sport of him. He answered, with embarrassment, that his\neffects were on the Grafskaya, and that his brother had promised to\nsend them to him on the morrow.\n\nBut the lieutenant-colonel was not listening to him, and, turning to\nthe sergeant, he inquired:--\n\n"Where are we to put the ensign?"\n\n"The ensign, sir?" said the sergeant, throwing Volodya into still\ngreater confusion by the fleeting glance which he cast upon him, and\nwhich seemed to say, "What sort of an ensign is this?"--"He can be\nquartered downstairs, with the staff-captain, Your Excellency," he\ncontinued, after a little reflection. "The captain is at the bastion\njust now, and his cot is empty."\n\n"Will that not suit you, temporarily?" said the commander.--"I think you\nmust be tired, but we will lodge you better to-morrow."\n\nVolodya rose and bowed.\n\n"Will you not have some tea?" said the commander, when he had already\nreached the door. "The samovar can be brought in."\n\nVolodya saluted and left the room. The lieutenant-colonel\'s servant\nconducted him downstairs, and led him into a bare, dirty chamber, in\nwhich various sorts of rubbish were lying about, and where there was\nan iron bedstead without either sheets or coverlet. A man in a red\nshirt was fast asleep on the bed, covered over with a thick cloak.\n\nVolodya took him for a soldier.\n\n"Piotr Nikolaitch!" said the servant, touching the sleeper on the\nshoulder. "The ensign is to sleep here.... This is our yunker," he\nadded, turning to the ensign.\n\n"Ah, don\'t trouble him, please," said Volodya; but the yunker, a tall,\nstout, young man, with a handsome but very stupid face, rose from the\nbed, threw on his cloak, and, evidently not having had a good sleep,\nleft the room.\n\n"No matter; I\'ll lie down in the yard," he growled out.\n\n\nXIII.\n\nLeft alone with his own thoughts, Volodya\'s first sensation was a fear\nof the incoherent, forlorn state of his own soul. He wanted to go to\nsleep, and forget all his surroundings, and himself most of all. He\nextinguished the candle, lay down on the bed, and, taking off his coat,\nhe wrapped his head up in it, in order to relieve his terror of the\ndarkness, with which he had been afflicted since his childhood. But all\nat once the thought occurred to him that a bomb might come and crush\nin the roof and kill him. He began to listen attentively; directly\noverhead, he heard the footsteps of the battery commander.\n\n"Anyway, if it does come," he thought, "it will kill any one who is\nupstairs first, and then me; at all events, I shall not be the only\none."\n\nThis thought calmed him somewhat.\n\n"Well, and what if Sevastopol should be taken unexpectedly, in the\nnight, and the French make their way hither? What am I to defend myself\nwith?"\n\nHe rose once more, and began to pace the room. His terror of the actual\ndanger outweighed his secret fear of the darkness. There was nothing\nheavy in the room except the samovar and a saddle. "I am a scoundrel, a\ncoward, a miserable coward!" the thought suddenly occurred to him, and\nagain he experienced that oppressive sensation of scorn and disgust,\neven for himself. Again he threw himself on the bed, and tried not to\nthink.\n\nThen the impressions of the day involuntarily penetrated his\nimagination, in consequence of the unceasing sounds, which made the\nglass in the solitary window rattle, and again the thought of danger\nrecurred to him: now he saw visions of wounded men and blood, now\nof bombs and splinters, flying into the room, then of the pretty\nlittle Sister of Mercy, who was applying a bandage to him, a dying\nman, and weeping over him, then of his mother, accompanying him to\nthe provincial town, and praying, amid burning tears, before the\nwonder-working images, and once more sleep appeared an impossibility to\nhim.\n\nBut suddenly the thought of Almighty God, who can do all things, and\nwho hears every supplication, came clearly into his mind. He knelt\ndown, crossed himself, and folded his hands as he had been taught to do\nin his childhood, when he prayed. This gesture, all at once, brought\nback to him a consoling feeling, which he had long since forgotten.\n\n"If I must die, if I must cease to exist, \'thy will be done, Lord,\'"\nhe thought; "let it be quickly; but if bravery is needed, and the\nfirmness which I do not possess, give them to me; deliver me from shame\nand disgrace, which I cannot bear, but teach me what to do in order to\nfulfil thy will."\n\nHis childish, frightened, narrow soul was suddenly encouraged; it\ncleared up, and caught sight of broad, brilliant, and new horizons.\nDuring the brief period while this feeling lasted, he felt and thought\nmany other things, and soon fell asleep quietly and unconcernedly, to\nthe continuous sounds of the roar of the bombardment and the rattling\nof the window-panes.\n\nGreat Lord! thou alone hast heard, and thou alone knowest those ardent,\ndespairing prayers of ignorance, of troubled repentance, those\npetitions for the healing of the body and the enlightenment of the\nmind, which have ascended to thee from that terrible precinct of death,\nfrom the general who, a moment before, was thinking of his cross of the\nGeorge on his neck, and conscious in his terror of thy near presence,\nto the simple soldier writhing on the bare earth of the Nikolaevsky\nbattery, and beseeching thee to bestow upon him there the reward,\nunconsciously presaged, for all his sufferings.\n\n\nXIV.\n\nThe elder Kozeltzoff, meeting on the street a soldier belonging to his\nregiment, betook himself at once, in company with the man, to the fifth\nbastion.\n\n"Keep under the wall, Your Honor," said the soldier.\n\n"What for?"\n\n"It\'s dangerous, Your Honor; there\'s one passing over," said the\nsoldier, listening to the sound of a screaming cannon-ball, which\nstruck the dry road, on the other side of the street.\n\nKozeltzoff, paying no heed to the soldier, walked bravely along the\nmiddle of the street.\n\nThese were the same streets, the same fires, even more frequent now,\nthe sounds, the groans, the encounters with the wounded, and the same\nbatteries, breastworks, and trenches, which had been there in the\nspring, when he was last in Sevastopol; but, for some reason, all this\nwas now more melancholy, and, at the same time, more energetic, the\napertures in the houses were larger, there were no longer any lights in\nthe windows, with the exception of the Kushtchin house (the hospital),\nnot a woman was to be met with, the earlier tone of custom and freedom\nfrom care no longer rested over all, but, instead, a certain impress of\nheavy expectation, of weariness and earnestness.\n\nBut here is the last trench already, and here is the voice of a soldier\nof the P---- regiment, who has recognized the former commander of his\ncompany, and here stands the third battalion in the gloom, clinging\nclose to the wall, and lighted up now and then, for a moment, by the\ndischarges, and a sound of subdued conversation, and the rattling of\nguns.\n\n"Where is the commander of the regiment?" inquired Kozeltzoff.\n\n"In the bomb-proofs with the sailors, Your Honor," replied the soldier,\nready to be of service. "I will show you the way, if you like."\n\nFrom trench to trench the soldier led Kozeltzoff, to the small ditch in\nthe trench. In the ditch sat a sailor, smoking his pipe; behind him a\ndoor was visible, through whose cracks shone a light.\n\n"Can I enter?"\n\n"I will announce you at once," and the sailor went in through the door.\n\nTwo voices became audible on the other side of the door.\n\n"If Prussia continues to observe neutrality," said one voice, "then\nAustria also...."\n\n"What difference does Austria make," said the second, "when the Slavic\nlands ... well, ask him to come in."\n\nKozeltzoff had never been in this casemate. He was struck by its\nelegance. The floor was of polished wood, screens shielded the door.\nTwo bedsteads stood against the wall, in one corner stood a large\nikon of the mother of God, in a gilt frame, and before her burned a\nrose-colored lamp.\n\nOn one of the beds, a naval officer, fully dressed, was sleeping. On\nthe other, by a table upon which stood two bottles of wine, partly\nempty, sat the men who were talking--the new regimental commander and\nhis adjutant.\n\nAlthough Kozeltzoff was far from being a coward, and was certainly\nnot guilty of any wrongdoing so far as his superior officers were\nconcerned, nor towards the regimental commander, yet he felt timid\nbefore the colonel, who had been his comrade not long before, so\nproudly did this colonel rise and listen to him.\n\n"It is strange," thought Kozeltzoff, as he surveyed his commander, "it\nis only seven weeks since he took the regiment, and how visible already\nis his power as regimental commander, in everything about him--in his\ndress, his bearing, his look. Is it so very long," thought he, "since\nthis Batrishtcheff used to carouse with us, and he wore a cheap cotton\nshirt, and ate by himself, never inviting any one to his quarters, his\neternal meat-balls and curd-patties? But now! and that expression of\ncold pride in his eyes, which says to you, \'Though I am your comrade,\nbecause I am a regimental commander of the new school, yet, believe me,\nI am well aware that you would give half your life merely for the sake\nof being in my place!\'"\n\n"You have been a long time in recovering," said the colonel to\nKozeltzoff, coldly, with a stare.\n\n"I was ill, colonel! The wound has not closed well even now."\n\n"Then there was no use in your coming," said the colonel, casting\nan incredulous glance at the captain\'s stout figure. "You are,\nnevertheless, in a condition to fulfil your duty?"\n\n"Certainly I am, sir."\n\n"Well I\'m very glad of that, sir. You will take the ninth company from\nEnsign Zaitzoff--the one you had before; you will receive your orders\nimmediately."\n\n"I obey, sir."\n\n"Take care to send me the regimental adjutant when you arrive," said\nthe regimental commander, giving him to understand, by a slight nod,\nthat his audience was at an end.\n\nOn emerging from the casemate, Kozeltzoff muttered something several\ntimes, and shrugged his shoulders, as though pained, embarrassed,\nor vexed at something, and vexed, not at the regimental commander\n(there was no cause for that), but at himself, and he appeared to be\ndissatisfied with himself and with everything about him.\n\n\nXV.\n\nBefore going to his officers, Kozeltzoff went to greet his company, and\nto see where it was stationed.\n\nThe breastwork of gabions, the shapes of the trenches, the cannons\nwhich he passed, even the fragments of shot, bombs, over which he\nstumbled in his path--all this, incessantly illuminated by the light\nof the firing, was well known to him, all this had engraved itself\nin vivid colors on his memory, three months before, during the two\nweeks which he had spent in this very bastion, without once leaving\nit. Although there was much that was terrible in these reminiscences,\na certain charm of past things was mingled with it, and he recognized\nthe familiar places and objects with pleasure, as though the two weeks\nspent there had been agreeable ones. The company was stationed along\nthe defensive wall toward the sixth bastion.\n\nKozeltzoff entered the long casemate, utterly unprotected at the\nentrance side, in which they had told him that the ninth company\nwas stationed. There was, literally, no room to set his foot in the\ncasemate, so filled was it, from the very entrance, with soldiers. On\none side burned a crooked tallow candle, which a recumbent soldier\nwas holding to illuminate the book which another one was spelling\nout slowly. Around the candle, in the reeking half-light, heads were\nvisible, eagerly raised in strained attention to the reader. The little\nbook in question was a primer. As Kozeltzoff entered the casemate, he\nheard the following:\n\n"Pray-er af-ter lear-ning. I thank Thee, Crea-tor ..."\n\n"Snuff that candle!" said a voice. "That\'s a splendid book." "My ...\nGod ..." went on the reader.\n\nWhen Kozeltzoff asked for the sergeant, the reader stopped, the\nsoldiers began to move about, coughed, and blew their noses, as they\nalways do after enforced silence. The sergeant rose near the group\nabout the reader, buttoning up his coat as he did so, and stepping over\nand on the feet of those who had no room to withdraw them, and came\nforward to his officer.\n\n"How are you, brother? Do all these belong to our company?"\n\n"I wish you health! Welcome on your return, Your Honor!" replied the\nsergeant, with a cheerful and friendly look at Kozeltzoff. "Has Your\nHonor recovered your health? Well, God be praised. It has been very\ndull for us without you."\n\nIt was immediately apparent that Kozeltzoff was beloved in the company.\n\nIn the depths of the casemate, voices could be heard. Their old\ncommander, who had been wounded, Mikhail Semyonitch Kozeltzoff,\nhad arrived, and so forth; some even approached, and the drummer\ncongratulated him.\n\n"How are you, Obantchuk?" said Kozeltzoff. "Are you all right?\nGood-day, children!" he said, raising his voice.\n\n"We wish you health!" sounded through the casemate.\n\n"How are you getting on, children?"\n\n"Badly, Your Honor. The French are getting the better of us.--Fighting\nfrom behind the fortifications is bad work, and that\'s all there is\nabout it! and they won\'t come out into the open field."\n\n"Perhaps luck is with me, and God will grant that they shall come out\ninto the field, children!" said Kozeltzoff. "It won\'t be the first time\nthat you and I have taken a hand together: we\'ll beat them again."\n\n"We\'ll be glad to try it, Your Honor!" exclaimed several voices.\n\n"And how about them--are they really bold?"\n\n"Frightfully bold!" said the drummer, not loudly, but so that his words\nwere audible, turning to another soldier, as though justifying before\nhim the words of the commander, and persuading him that there was\nnothing boastful or improbable in these words.\n\nFrom the soldiers, Kozeltzoff proceeded to the defensive barracks and\nhis brother officers.\n\n\nXVI.\n\nIn the large room of the barracks there was a great number of men;\nnaval, artillery, and infantry officers. Some were sleeping, others\nwere conversing, seated on the shot-chests and gun-carriages of the\ncannons of the fortifications; others still, who formed a very numerous\nand noisy group behind the arch, were seated upon two felt rugs, which\nhad been spread on the floor, and were drinking porter and playing\ncards.\n\n"Ah! Kozeltzoff, Kozeltzoff! Capital! it\'s a good thing that he has\ncome! He\'s a brave fellow!... How\'s your wound?" rang out from various\nquarters. Here also it was evident that they loved him and were\nrejoiced at his coming.\n\nAfter shaking hands with his friends, Kozeltzoff joined the noisy\ngroup of officers engaged in playing cards. There were some of his\nacquaintances among them. A slender, handsome, dark-complexioned man,\nwith a long, sharp nose and a huge moustache, which began on his\ncheeks, was dealing the cards with his thin, white, taper fingers,\non one of which there was a heavy gold seal ring. He was dealing\nstraight on, and carelessly, being evidently excited by something,--and\nmerely desirous of making a show of heedlessness. On his right, and\nbeside him, lay a gray-haired major, supporting himself on his elbow,\nand playing for half a ruble with affected coolness, and settling up\nimmediately. On his left squatted an officer with a red, perspiring\nface, who was laughing and jesting in a constrained way. When his\ncards won, he moved one hand about incessantly in his empty trousers\npocket. He was playing high, and evidently no longer for ready money,\nwhich displeased the handsome, dark-complexioned man. A thin and pallid\nofficer with a bald head, and a huge nose and mouth, was walking about\nthe room, holding a large package of bank-notes in his hand, staking\nready money on the bank, and winning.\n\nKozeltzoff took a drink of vodka, and sat down by the players.\n\n"Take a hand, Mikhail Semyonitch!" said the dealer to him; "you have\nbrought lots of money, I suppose."\n\n"Where should I get any money! On the contrary, I got rid of the last I\nhad in town."\n\n"The idea! Some one certainly must have fleeced you in Simpferopol."\n\n"I really have but very little," said Kozeltzoff, but he was evidently\ndesirous that they should not believe him; then he unbuttoned his coat,\nand took the old cards in his hand.\n\n"I don\'t care if I do try; there\'s no knowing what the Evil One will\ndo! queer things do come about at times. But I must have a drink, to\nget up my courage."\n\nAnd within a very short space of time he had drunk another glass of\nvodka and several of porter, and had lost his last three rubles.\n\nA hundred and fifty rubles were written down against the little,\nperspiring officer.\n\n"No, he will not bring them," said he, carelessly, drawing a fresh card.\n\n"Try to send it," said the dealer to him, pausing a moment in his\noccupation of laying out the cards, and glancing at him.\n\n"Permit me to send it to-morrow," repeated the perspiring officer,\nrising, and moving his hand about vigorously in his empty pocket.\n\n"Hm!" growled the dealer, and, throwing the cards angrily to the right\nand left, he completed the deal. "But this won\'t do," said he, when he\nhad dealt the cards. "I\'m going to stop. It won\'t do, Zakhar Ivanitch,"\nhe added, "we have been playing for ready money and not on credit."\n\n"What, do you doubt me? That\'s strange, truly!"\n\n"From whom is one to get anything?" muttered the major, who had won\nabout eight rubles. "I have lost over twenty rubles, but when I have\nwon--I get nothing."\n\n"How am I to pay," said the dealer, "when there is no money on the\ntable?"\n\n"I won\'t listen to you!" shouted the major, jumping up, "I am playing\nwith you, but not with him."\n\nAll at once the perspiring officer flew into a rage.\n\n"I tell you that I will pay to-morrow; how dare you say such\nimpertinent things to me?"\n\n"I shall say what I please! This is not the way to do--that\'s the\ntruth!" shouted the major.\n\n"That will do, Feodor Feodoritch!" all chimed in, holding back the\nmajor.\n\nBut let us draw a veil over this scene. To-morrow, to-day, it may be,\neach one of these men will go cheerfully and proudly to meet his death,\nand he will die with firmness and composure; but the one consolation of\nlife in these conditions, which terrify even the coldest imagination in\nthe absence of all that is human, and the hopelessness of any escape\nfrom them, the one consolation is forgetfulness, the annihilation\nof consciousness. At the bottom of the soul of each lies that noble\nspark, which makes of him a hero; but this spark wearies of burning\nclearly--when the fateful moment comes it flashes up into a flame, and\nilluminates great deeds.\n\n\nXVII.\n\nOn the following day, the bombardment proceeded with the same vigor.\nAt eleven o\'clock in the morning, Volodya Kozeltzoff was seated in\na circle of battery officers, and, having already succeeded to some\nextent in habituating himself to them, he was surveying the new faces,\ntaking observations, making inquiries, and telling stories.\n\nThe discreet conversation of the artillery officers, which made some\npretensions to learning, pleased him and inspired him with respect.\nVolodya\'s shy, innocent, and handsome appearance disposed the officers\nin his favor.\n\nThe eldest officer in the battery, the captain, a short,\nsandy-complexioned man, with his hair arranged in a topknot, and smooth\non the temples, educated in the old traditions of the artillery, a\nsquire of dames, and a would-be learned man, questioned Volodya as to\nhis acquirements in artillery and new inventions, jested caressingly\nover his youth and his pretty little face, and treated him, in\ngeneral, as a father treats a son, which was extremely agreeable to\nVolodya.\n\nSub-Lieutenant Dyadenko, a young officer, who talked with a Little\nRussian accent, had a tattered cloak and dishevelled hair, although\nhe talked very loudly, and constantly seized opportunities to dispute\nacrimoniously over some topic, and was very abrupt in his movements,\npleased Volodya, who, beneath this rough exterior, could not help\ndetecting in him a very fine and extremely good man. Dyadenko was\nincessantly offering his services to Volodya, and pointing out to him\nthat not one of the guns in Sevastopol was properly placed, according\nto rule.\n\nLieutenant Tchernovitzky, with his brows elevated on high, though he\nwas more courteous than any of the rest, and dressed in a coat that\nwas tolerably clean, but not new, and carefully patched, and though\nhe displayed a gold watch-chain on a satin waistcoat, did not please\nVolodya. He kept inquiring what the Emperor and the minister of war\nwere doing, and related to him, with unnatural triumph, the deeds of\nvalor which had been performed in Sevastopol, complained of the small\nnumber of true patriots, and displayed a great deal of learning, and\nsense, and noble feeling in general; but, for some reason, all this\nseemed unpleasant and unnatural to Volodya. The principal thing which\nhe noticed was that the other officers hardly spoke to Tchernovitzky.\n\nYunker Vlang, whom he had waked up on the preceding evening, was also\nthere. He said nothing, but, seated modestly in a corner, laughed when\nanything amusing occurred, refreshed their memories when they forgot\nanything, handed the vodka, and made cigarettes for all the officers.\nWhether it was the modest, courteous manners of Volodya, who treated\nhim exactly as he did the officers, and did not torment him as though\nhe were a little boy, or his agreeable personal appearance which\ncaptivated Vlang_a_, as the soldiers called him, declining his name,\nfor some reason or other, in the feminine gender, at all events, he\nnever took his big, kind eyes from the face of the new officer. He\ndivined and anticipated all his wishes, and remained uninterruptedly in\na sort of lover-like ecstasy, which, of course, the officers perceived,\nand made fun of.\n\nBefore dinner, the staff-captain was relieved from the battery, and\njoined their company. Staff-Captain Kraut was a light-complexioned,\nhandsome, dashing officer, with a heavy, reddish moustache, and\nside-whiskers; he spoke Russian capitally, but too elegantly and\ncorrectly for a Russian. In the service and in his life, he had been\nthe same as in his language; he served very well, was a capital\ncomrade, and the most faithful of men in money matters; but simply\nas a man something was lacking in him, precisely because everything\nabout him was so excellent. Like all Russian-Germans, by a strange\ncontradiction with the ideal German, he was "praktisch" to the highest\ndegree.\n\n"Here he is, our hero makes his appearance!" said the captain, as\nKraut, flourishing his arms and jingling his spurs, entered the room.\n"Which will you have, Friedrich Krestyanitch, tea or vodka?"\n\n"I have already ordered my tea to be served," he answered, "but I may\ntake a little drop of vodka also, for the refreshing of the soul.\nVery glad to make your acquaintance; I beg that you will love us, and\nlend us your favor," he said to Volodya, who rose and bowed to him.\n"Staff-Captain Kraut.... The gun-sergeant on the bastion informed me\nthat you arrived last night."\n\n"Much obliged for your bed; I passed the night in it."\n\n"I hope you found it comfortable? One of the legs is broken; but no one\ncan stand on ceremony--in time of siege--you must prop it up."\n\n"Well, now, did you have a fortunate time on your watch?" asked\nDyadenko.\n\n"Yes, all right; only Skvortzoff was hit, and we mended one of the\ngun-carriages last night. The cheek was smashed to atoms."\n\nHe rose from his seat, and began to walk up and down; it was plain that\nhe was wholly under the influence of that agreeable sensation which a\nman experiences who has just escaped a danger.\n\n"Well, Dmitri Gavrilitch," he said, tapping the captain on the knee,\n"how are you getting on, my dear fellow? How about your promotion?--no\nword yet?"\n\n"Nothing yet."\n\n"No, and there will be nothing," interpolated Dyadenko: "I proved that\nto you before."\n\n"Why won\'t there?"\n\n"Because the story was not properly written down."\n\n"Oh, you quarrelsome fellow, you quarrelsome fellow!" said Kraut,\nsmiling gayly; "a regular obstinate Little Russian! Now, just to\nprovoke you, he\'ll turn out your lieutenant."\n\n"No, he won\'t."\n\n"Vlang! fetch me my pipe, and fill it," said he, turning to the yunker,\nwho at once hastened up obligingly with the pipe.\n\nKraut made them all lively; he told about the bombardment, he inquired\nwhat had been going on in his absence, and entered into conversation\nwith every one.\n\n\nXVIII.\n\n"Well, how are things? Have you already got settled among us?" Kraut\nasked Volodya.... "Excuse me, what is your name and patronymic? that\'s\nthe custom with us in the artillery, you know. Have you got hold of a\nsaddle-horse?"\n\n"No," said Volodya; "I do not know what to do. I told the captain that\nI had no horse, and no money, either, until I get some for forage and\ntravelling expenses. I want to ask the battery commander for a horse in\nthe meantime, but I am afraid that he will refuse me."\n\n"Apollon Sergieitch, do you mean?" he produced with his lips a sound\nindicative of the strongest doubt, and glanced at the captain; "not\nlikely."\n\n"What\'s that? If he does refuse, there\'ll be no harm done," said the\ncaptain. "There are horses, to tell the truth, which are not needed,\nbut still one might try; I will inquire to-day."\n\n"What! Don\'t you know him?" Dyadenko interpolated. "He might refuse\nanything, but there is no reason for refusing this. Do you want to bet\non it?..."\n\n"Well, of course, everybody knows already that you always contradict."\n\n"I contradict because I know. He is niggardly about other things, but\nhe will give the horse because it is no advantage to him to refuse."\n\n"No advantage, indeed, when it costs him eight rubles here for oats!"\nsaid Kraut. "Is there no advantage in not keeping an extra horse?"\n\n"Ask Skvoretz yourself, Vladimir Semyonitch!" said Vlang, returning\nwith Kraut\'s pipe. "It\'s a capital horse."\n\n"The one you tumbled into the ditch with, on the festival of the forty\nmartyrs, in March? Hey! Vlang?" remarked the staff-captain.\n\n"No, and why should you say that it costs eight rubles for oats,"\npursued Dyadenko, "when his own inquiries show him that it is ten and a\nhalf; of course, he has no object in it."\n\n"Just as though he would have nothing left! So when you get to be\nbattery commander, you won\'t let any horses go into the town?"\n\n"When I get to be battery commander, my dear fellow, my horses will get\nfour measures of oats to eat, and I shall not accumulate an income,\nnever fear!"\n\n"If we live, we shall see," said the staff-captain; "and you will act\njust so, and so will he when he commands a battery," he added, pointing\nat Volodya.\n\n"Why do you think, Friedrich Krestyanitch, that he would turn it to his\nprofit?" broke in Tchernovitzky. "Perhaps he has property of his own;\nthen why should he turn it to profit?"\n\n"No, sir, I ... excuse me, captain," said Volodya, reddening up to his\nears, "that strikes me as insulting."\n\n"Oh ho, ho! What a madcap he is!" said Kraut.\n\n"That has nothing to do with it; I only think that if the money were\nnot mine, I should not take it."\n\n"Now, I\'ll tell you something right here, young man," began the\nstaff-captain in a more serious tone, "you are to understand that when\nyou command a battery, if you manage things well, that\'s sufficient;\nthe commander of a battery does not meddle with provisioning the\nsoldiers; that is the way it has been from time immemorial in the\nartillery. If you are a bad manager, you will have nothing left. Now,\nthese are the expenditures in conformity with your position: for\nshoeing your horse,--one (he closed one finger); for the apothecary,--two\n(he closed another finger); for office work,--three (he shut a\nthird); for extra horses, which cost five hundred rubles, my dear\nfellow,--that\'s four; you must change the soldiers\' collars, you will\nuse a great deal of coal, you must keep open table for your officers.\nIf you are a battery-commander, you must live decently; you need a\ncarriage, and a fur coat, and this thing and that thing, and a dozen\nmore ... but what\'s the use of enumerating them all!"\n\n"But this is the principal thing, Vladimir Semyonitch," interpolated\nthe captain, who had held his peace all this time; "imagine yourself to\nbe a man who, like myself, for instance, has served twenty years, first\nfor two hundred, then for three hundred rubles pay; why should he not\nbe given at least a bit of bread, against his old age?"\n\n"Eh! yes, there you have it!" spoke up the staff-captain again, "don\'t\nbe in a hurry to pronounce judgment, but live on and serve your time."\n\nVolodya was horribly ashamed and sorry for having spoken so\nthoughtlessly, and he muttered something and continued to listen in\nsilence, when Dyadenko undertook, with the greatest zeal, to dispute it\nand to prove the contrary.\n\nThe dispute was interrupted by the arrival of the colonel\'s servant,\nwho summoned them to dinner.\n\n"Tell Apollon Sergieitch that he must give us some wine to-day," said\nTchernovitzky, to the captain, as he buttoned up his uniform.--"Why is\nhe so stingy with it? He will be killed, and no one will get the good\nof it."\n\n"Tell him yourself."\n\n"Not a bit of it. You are my superior officer. Rank must be regarded in\nall things."\n\n\nXIX.\n\nThe table had been moved out from the wall, and spread with a soiled\ntable-cloth, in the same room in which Volodya had presented himself to\nthe colonel on the preceding evening. The battery commander now offered\nhim his hand, and questioned him about Petersburg and his journey.\n\n"Well, gentlemen, I beg the favor of a glass with any of you who drink\nvodka. The ensigns do not drink," he added, with a smile.\n\nOn the whole, the battery commander did not appear nearly so stern\nto-day as he had on the preceding evening; on the contrary, he had the\nappearance of a kindly, hospitable host, and an elder comrade among the\nofficers. But, in spite of this, all the officers, from the old captain\ndown to Ensign Dyadenko, by their very manner of speaking and looking\nthe commander straight in the eye, as they approached, one after the\nother, to drink their vodka, exhibited great respect for him.\n\nThe dinner consisted of a large wooden bowl of cabbage-soup, in\nwhich floated fat chunks of beef, and a huge quantity of pepper and\nlaurel-leaves, mustard, and Polish meat-balls in a cabbage leaf,\nturnover patties of chopped meat and dough, and with butter, which\nwas not perfectly fresh. There were no napkins, the spoons were of\npewter and wood, there were only two glasses, and on the table stood\na decanter of water with a broken neck; but the dinner was not dull;\nconversation never halted.\n\nAt first, their talk turned on the battle of Inkerman, in which the\nbattery had taken part, as to the causes of failure, of which each one\ngave his own impressions and ideas, and held his tongue as soon as\nthe battery commander himself began to speak; then the conversation\nnaturally changed to the insufficiency of calibre of the light guns,\nand upon the new lightened cannons, in which connection Volodya had an\nopportunity to display his knowledge of artillery.\n\nBut their talk did not dwell upon the present terrible position of\nSevastopol, as though each of them had meditated too much on that\nsubject to allude to it again. In the same way, to Volodya\'s great\namazement and disappointment, not a word was said about the duties\nof the service which he was to fulfil, just as though he had come to\nSevastopol merely for the purpose of telling about the new cannon and\ndining with the commander of the battery.\n\nWhile they were at dinner, a bomb fell not far from the house in which\nthey were seated. The walls and the floor trembled, as though in an\nearthquake, and the window was obscured with the smoke of the powder.\n\n"You did not see anything of this sort in Petersburg, I fancy; but\nthese surprises often take place here," said the battery commander.\n\n"Look out, Vlang, and see where it burst."\n\nVlang looked, and reported that it had burst on the square, and then\nthere was nothing more said about the bomb.\n\nJust before the end of the dinner, an old man, the clerk of the\nbattery, entered the room, with three sealed envelopes, and handed them\nto the commander.\n\n"This is very important; a messenger has this moment brought these from\nthe chief of the artillery."\n\nAll the officers gazed, with impatient curiosity, at the commander\'s\npractised fingers as they broke the seal of the envelope and drew forth\nthe _very important_ paper. "What can it be?" each one asked himself.\n\nIt might be that they were to march out of Sevastopol for a rest, it\nmight be an order for the whole battery to betake themselves to the\nbastions.\n\n"Again!" said the commander, flinging the paper angrily on the table.\n\n"What\'s it about, Apollon Sergieitch?" inquired the eldest officer.\n\n"An officer and crew are required for a mortar battery over yonder,\nand I have only four officers, and there is not a full gun-crew in\nthe line," growled the commander: "and here more are demanded of me.\nBut some one must go, gentlemen," he said, after a brief pause: "the\norder requires him to be at the barrier at seven o\'clock.... Send the\nsergeant! Who is to go, gentlemen? decide," he repeated.\n\n"Well, here\'s one who has never been yet," said Tchernovitzky, pointing\nto Volodya. The commander of the battery made no reply.\n\n"Yes, I should like to go," said Volodya, as he felt the cold sweat\nstart out on his back and neck.\n\n"No; why should you? There\'s no occasion!" broke in the captain. "Of\ncourse, no one will refuse, but neither is it proper to ask any one;\nbut if Apollon Sergieitch will permit us, we will draw lots, as we did\nonce before."\n\nAll agreed to this. Kraut cut some paper into bits, folded them up, and\ndropped them into a cap. The captain jested, and even plucked up the\naudacity, on this occasion, to ask the colonel for wine, to keep up\ntheir courage, he said. Dyadenko sat in gloomy silence, Volodya smiled\nat something or other, Tchernovitzky declared that it would infallibly\nfall to him, Kraut was perfectly composed.\n\nVolodya was allowed to draw first; he took one slip, which was rather\nlong, but it immediately occurred to him to change it; he took another,\nwhich was smaller and thinner, unfolded it, and read on it, "I go."\n\n"It has fallen to me," he said, with a sigh.\n\n"Well, God be with you. You will get your baptism of fire at once,"\nsaid the commander of the battery, gazing at the perturbed countenance\nof the ensign with a kindly smile; "but you must get there as speedily\nas possible. And, to make it more cheerful for you, Vlang shall go with\nyou as gun-sergeant."\n\n\nXX.\n\nVlang was exceedingly well pleased with the duty assigned to him, and\nran hastily to make his preparations, and, when he was dressed, he went\nto the assistance of Volodya, and tried to persuade the latter to take\nhis cot and fur coat with him, and some old "Annals of the Country,"\nand a spirit-lamp coffee-pot, and other useless things. The captain\nadvised Volodya to read up his "Manual,"[L] first, about mortar-firing,\nand immediately to copy the tables out of it.\n\n[L] "Manual for Artillery Officers," by Bezak.\n\nVolodya set about this at once, and, to his amazement and delight, he\nperceived that, though he was still somewhat troubled with a sensation\nof fear of danger, and still more lest he should turn out a coward, yet\nit was far from being to that degree to which it had affected him on\nthe preceding evening. The reason for this lay partly in the daylight\nand in active occupation, and partly, principally, also, in the fact\nthat fear and all powerful emotions cannot long continue with the same\nintensity. In a word, he had already succeeded in recovering from his\nterror.\n\nAt seven o\'clock, just as the sun had begun to hide itself behind the\nNikolaevsky barracks, the sergeant came to him, and announced that the\nmen were ready and waiting for him.\n\n"I have given the list to Vlang_a_. You will please to ask him for it,\nYour Honor!" said he.\n\nTwenty artillery-men, with side-arms, but without loading-tools, were\nstanding at the corner of the house. Volodya and the yunker stepped up\nto them.\n\n"Shall I make them a little speech, or shall I simply say, \'Good day,\nchildren!\' or shall I say nothing at all?" thought he. "And why should\nI not say, \'Good day, children!\' Why, I ought to say that much!" And he\nshouted boldly, in his ringing voice:--\n\n"Good day, children!"\n\nThe soldiers responded cheerfully. The fresh, young voice sounded\npleasant in the ears of all. Volodya marched vigorously at their head,\nin front of the soldiers, and, although his heart beat as if he had run\nseveral versts at the top of his speed, his step was light and his\ncountenance cheerful.\n\nOn arriving at the Malakoff mound, and climbing the slope, he\nperceived that Vlang, who had not lagged a single pace behind him,\nand who had appeared such a valiant fellow at home in the house, kept\nconstantly swerving to one side, and ducking his head, as though all\nthe cannon-balls and bombs, which whizzed by very frequently in that\nlocality, were flying straight at him. Some of the soldiers did the\nsame, and the faces of the majority of them betrayed, if not fear, at\nleast anxiety. This circumstance put the finishing touch to Volodya\'s\ncomposure and encouraged him finally.\n\n"So here I am also on the Malakoff mound, which I imagined to be a\nthousand times more terrible! And I can walk along without ducking my\nhead before the bombs, and am far less terrified than the rest! So I\nam not a coward, after all?" he thought with delight, and even with a\nsomewhat enthusiastic self-sufficiency.\n\nBut this feeling was soon shaken by a spectacle upon which he stumbled\nin the twilight, on the Kornilovsky battery, in his search for the\ncommander of the bastion. Four sailors standing near the breastworks\nwere holding the bloody body of a man, without shoes or coat, by its\narms and legs, and staggering as they tried to fling it over the\nramparts.\n\n(On the second day of the bombardment, it had been found impossible,\nin some localities, to carry off the corpses from the bastions, and so\nthey were flung into the trench, in order that they might not impede\naction in the batteries.)\n\nVolodya stood petrified for a moment, as he saw the corpse waver on\nthe summit of the breastworks, and then roll down into the ditch;\nbut, luckily for him, the commander of the bastion met him there,\ncommunicated his orders, and furnished him with a guide to the battery\nand to the bomb-proofs designated for his service. We will not\nenumerate the remaining dangers and disenchantments which our hero\nunderwent that evening: how, instead of the firing, such as he had seen\non the Volkoff field, according to the rules of accuracy and precision,\nwhich he had expected to find here, he found two cracked mortars, one\nof which had been crushed by a cannon-ball in the muzzle, while the\nother stood upon the splinters of a ruined platform; how he could not\nobtain any workmen until the following morning in order to repair the\nplatform; how not a single charge was of the weight prescribed in the\n"Manual;" how two soldiers of his command were wounded, and how he was\ntwenty times within a hair\'s-breadth of death.\n\nFortunately, there had been assigned for his assistant a gun-captain\nof gigantic size, a sailor, who had served on the mortars since the\nbeginning of the siege, and who convinced him of the practicability of\nusing them, conducted him all over the bastion, with a lantern, during\nthe night, exactly as though it had been his own kitchen-garden, and\nwho promised to put everything in proper shape on the morrow.\n\nThe bomb-proof to which his guide conducted him was excavated in the\nrocky soil, and consisted of a long hole, two cubic fathoms in extent,\ncovered with oaken planks an arshin in thickness. Here he took up his\npost, with all his soldiers. Vlang was the first, when he caught sight\nof the little door, twenty-eight inches high, of the bomb-proof, to\nrush headlong into it, in front of them all, and, after nearly cracking\nhis skull on the stone floor, he huddled down in a corner, from which\nhe did not again emerge.\n\nAnd Volodya, when all the soldiers had placed themselves along the wall\non the floor, and some had lighted their pipes, set up his bed in one\ncorner, lighted a candle, and lay upon his cot, smoking a cigarette.\n\nShots were incessantly heard, over the bomb-proof, but they were not\nvery loud, with the exception of those from one cannon, which stood\nclose by and shook the bomb-proof with its thunder. In the bomb-proof\nitself all was still; the soldiers, who were a little shy, as yet, of\nthe new officer, only exchanged a few words, now and then, as they\nrequested each other to move out of the way or to furnish a light for a\npipe. A rat scratched somewhere among the stones, or Vlang, who had not\nyet recovered himself, and who still gazed wildly about him, uttered a\nsudden vigorous sigh.\n\nVolodya, as he lay on his bed, in his quiet corner, surrounded by\nthe men, and illuminated only by a single candle, experienced that\nsensation of well-being which he had known as a child, when, in the\ncourse of a game of hide-and-seek, he used to crawl into a cupboard or\nunder his mother\'s skirts, and listen, not daring to draw his breath,\nand afraid of the dark, and yet conscious of enjoying himself. He felt\na little oppressed, but cheerful.\n\n\nXXI.\n\nAfter the lapse of about ten minutes, the soldiers began to change\nabout and to converse together. The most important personages among\nthem--the two gun-sergeants--placed themselves nearest the officer\'s\nlight and bed;--one was old and gray-haired, with every possible medal\nand cross except the George;--the other was young, a militia-man, who\nsmoked cigarettes, which he was rolling. The drummer, as usual, assumed\nthe duty of waiting on the officer. The bombardiers and cavalrymen\nsat next, and then farther away, in the shadow of the entrance,\nthe _underlings_ took up their post. They too began to talk among\nthemselves. It was caused by the hasty entrance of a man into the\ncasemate.\n\n"How now, brother! couldn\'t you stay in the street? Didn\'t the girls\nsing merrily?" said a voice.\n\n"They sing such marvellous songs as were never heard in the village,"\nsaid the man who had fled into the casemate, with a laugh.\n\n"But Vasin does not love bombs--ah, no, he does not love them!" said one\nfrom the aristocratic corner.\n\n"The idea! It\'s quite another matter when it\'s necessary," drawled the\nvoice of Vasin, who made all the others keep silent when he spoke:\n"since the 24th, the firing has been going on desperately; and what is\nthere wrong about it? You\'ll get killed for nothing, and your superiors\nwon\'t so much as say \'Thank you!\' for it."\n\nAt these words of Vasin, all burst into a laugh.\n\n"There\'s Melnikoff, that fellow who will sit outside the door," said\nsome one.\n\n"Well, send him here, that Melnikoff," added the old gunner; "they will\nkill him, for a fact, and that to no purpose."\n\n"Who is this Melnikoff?" asked Volodya.\n\n"Why, Your Honor, he\'s a stupid soldier of ours. He doesn\'t seem to be\nafraid of anything, and now he keeps walking about outside. Please to\ntake a look at him; he looks like a bear."\n\n"He knows a spell," said the slow voice of Vasin, from the corner.\n\nMelnikoff entered the bomb-proof. He was fat (which is extremely rare\namong soldiers), and a sandy-complexioned, handsome man, with a huge,\nbulging forehead and prominent, light blue eyes.\n\n"Are you afraid of the bombs?" Volodya asked him.\n\n"What is there about the bombs to be afraid of!" replied Melnikoff,\nshrugging his shoulders and scratching his head, "I know that I shall\nnot be killed by a bomb."\n\n"So you would like to go on living here?"\n\n"Why, of course, I would. It\'s jolly here!" he said, with a sudden\noutburst of laughter.\n\n"Oh, then you must be detailed for the sortie! I\'ll tell the general\nso, if you like?" said Volodya, although he was not acquainted with a\nsingle general there.\n\n"Why shouldn\'t I like! I do!"\n\nAnd Melnikoff disappeared behind the others.\n\n"Let\'s have a game of _noski_,[M] children! Who has cards?" rang out\nhis brisk voice.\n\n[M] A game in which the loser is rapped on the nose with the cards.\n\nAnd, in fact, it was not long before a game was started in the back\ncorner, and blows on the nose, laughter, and calling of trumps were\nheard.\n\nVolodya drank some tea from the samovar, which the drummer served for\nhim, treated the gunners, jested, chatted with them, being desirous of\nwinning popularity, and felt very well content with the respect which\nwas shown him. The soldiers, too, perceiving that the gentleman put on\nno airs, began to talk together.\n\nOne declared that the siege of Sevastopol would soon come to an end,\nbecause a trustworthy man from the fleet had said that the emperor\'s\nbrother Constantine was coming to our relief with the \'Merican fleet,\nand there would soon be an agreement that there should be no firing\nfor two weeks, and that a rest should be allowed, and if any one did\nfire a shot, every discharge would have to be paid for at the rate of\nseventy-five kopeks each.\n\nVasin, who, as Volodya had already noticed, was a little fellow, with\nlarge, kindly eyes, and side-whiskers, related, amid a general silence\nat first, and afterwards amid general laughter, how, when he had gone\nhome on leave, they had been glad at first to see him, but afterwards\nhis father had begun to send him off to work, and the lieutenant of\nthe foresters\' corps sent his drozhki for his wife.\n\nAll this amused Volodya greatly. He not only did not experience the\nleast fear or inconvenience from the closeness and heavy air in the\nbomb-proof, but he felt in a remarkably cheerful and agreeable frame of\nmind.\n\nMany of the soldiers were already snoring. Vlang had also stretched\nhimself out on the floor, and the old gun-sergeant, having spread out\nhis cloak, was crossing himself and muttering his prayers, preparatory\nto sleep, when Volodya took a fancy to step out of the bomb-proof, and\nsee what was going on outside.\n\n"Take your legs out of the way!" cried one soldier to another, as soon\nas he rose, and the legs were pressed aside to make way for him.\n\nVlang, who appeared to be asleep, suddenly raised his head, and seized\nVolodya by the skirt of his coat.\n\n"Come, don\'t go! how can you!" he began, in a tearfully imploring\ntone. "You don\'t know about things yet; they are firing at us out\nthere all the time; it is better here."\n\nBut, in spite of Vlang\'s entreaties, Volodya made his way out of the\nbomb-proof, and seated himself on the threshold, where Melnikoff was\nalready sitting.\n\nThe air was pure and fresh, particularly after the bomb-proof--the night\nwas clear and still. Through the roar of the discharges could be heard\nthe sounds of cart-wheels, bringing gabions, and the voices of the men\nwho were at work on the magazine. Above their heads was the lofty,\nstarry sky, across which flashed the fiery streaks caused by the bombs;\nan arshin away, on the left, a tiny opening led to another bomb-proof,\nthrough which the feet and backs of the soldiers who lived there were\nvisible, and through which their voices were audible; in front, the\nelevation produced by the powder-vault could be seen, and athwart it\nflitted the bent figures of men, and upon it, at the very summit, amid\nthe bullets and the bombs which whistled past the spot incessantly,\nstood a tall form in a black paletot, with his hands in his pockets,\nand feet treading down the earth, which other men were fetching in\nsacks. Often a bomb would fly over, and burst close to the cave. The\nsoldiers engaged in bringing the earth bent over and ran aside; but\nthe black figure never moved; went on quietly stamping down the dirt\nwith his feet, and remained on the spot in the same attitude as before.\n\n"Who is that black man?" inquired Volodya of Melnikoff.\n\n"I don\'t know; I will go and see."\n\n"Don\'t go! it is not necessary."\n\nBut Melnikoff, without heeding him, walked up to the black figure, and\nstood beside him for a tolerably long time, as calm and immovable as\nthe man himself.\n\n"That is the man who has charge of the magazine, Your Honor!" he said,\non his return. "It has been pierced by a bomb, so the infantry-men are\nfetching more earth."\n\nNow and then, a bomb seemed to fly straight at the door of the\nbomb-proof. On such occasions, Volodya shrank into the corner, and then\npeered forth again, gazing upwards, to see whether another was not\ncoming from some direction. Although Vlang, from the interior of the\nbomb-proof, repeatedly besought Volodya to come back, the latter sat on\nthe threshold for three hours, and experienced a sort of satisfaction\nin thus tempting fate and in watching the flight of the bombs. Towards\nthe end of the evening, he had learned from what point most of the\nfiring proceeded, and where the shots struck.\n\n\nXXII.\n\nOn the following day, the 27th, after a ten-hours sleep, Volodya, fresh\nand active, stepped out on the threshold of the casement; Vlang also\nstarted to crawl out with him, but, at the first sound of a bullet, he\nflung himself backwards through the opening of the bomb-proof, bumping\nhis head as he did so, amid the general merriment of the soldiers,\nthe majority of whom had also come out into the open air. Vlang, the\nold gun-sergeant, and a few others were the only ones who rarely went\nout into the trenches; it was impossible to restrain the rest; they\nall scattered about in the fresh morning air, escaping from the fetid\nair of the bomb-proof, and, in spite of the fact that the bombardment\nwas as vigorous as on the preceding evening, they disposed themselves\naround the door, and some even on the breastworks. Melnikoff had been\nstrolling about among the batteries since daybreak, and staring up with\nperfect coolness.\n\nNear the entrance sat two old soldiers and one young, curly-haired\nfellow, a Jew, who had been detailed from the infantry. This soldier\npicked up one of the bullets which were lying about, and, having\nsmoothed it against a stone with a potsherd, with his knife he carved\nfrom it a cross, after the style of the order of St. George; the others\nlooked on at his work as they talked. The cross really turned out to be\nquite handsome.\n\n"Now, if we stay here much longer," said one of them, "then, when peace\nis made, the time of service will be up for all of us."\n\n"Nothing of the sort; I have at least four years service yet before my\ntime is up, and I have been in Sevastopol these five months."\n\n"It is not counted towards the discharge, do you understand," said\nanother.\n\nAt that moment, a cannon-ball shrieked over the heads of the speakers,\nand struck only an arshin away from Melnikoff, who was approaching them\nfrom the trenches.\n\n"That came near killing Melnikoff," said one man.\n\n"I shall not be killed," said Melnikoff.\n\n"Here\'s the cross for you, for your bravery," said the young soldier,\nwho had made the cross, handing it to Melnikoff.\n\n"No, brother, a month here counts for a year, of course--that was the\norder," the conversation continued.\n\n"Think what you please, but when peace is declared, there will be an\nimperial review at Orshava, and if we don\'t get our discharge, we shall\nbe allowed to go on indefinite leave."\n\nAt that moment, a shrieking little bullet flew past the speakers\'\nheads, and struck a stone.\n\n"You\'ll get a full discharge before evening--see if you don\'t," said one\nof the soldiers.\n\nThey all laughed.\n\nNot only before evening, but before the expiration of two hours, two of\nthem received their full discharge, and five were wounded; but the rest\njested on as before.\n\nBy morning, the two mortars had actually been brought into such a\ncondition that it was possible to fire them. At ten o\'clock, in\naccordance with the orders which he had received from the commander of\nthe bastion, Volodya called out his command, and marched to the battery\nwith it.\n\nIn the men, as soon as they proceeded to action, there was not a drop\nof that sentiment of fear perceptible which had been expressed on the\npreceding evening. Vlang alone could not control himself; he dodged and\nducked just as before, and Vasin lost some of his composure, and fussed\nand fidgeted and changed his place incessantly.\n\nBut Volodya was in an extraordinary state of enthusiasm; the thought of\ndanger did not even occur to him. Delight that he was fulfilling his\nduty, that he was not only not a coward, but even a valiant fellow, the\nfeeling that he was in command, and the presence of twenty men, who,\nas he was aware, were surveying him with curiosity, made a thoroughly\nbrave man of him. He was even vain of his valor, put on airs before\nhis soldiers, climbed up on the banquette, and unbuttoned his coat\nexpressly that he might render himself the more distinctly visible.\n\nThe commander of the bastion, who was going the rounds of his\nestablishment as he expressed it, at the moment, accustomed as he had\nbecome during his eight-months experience to all sorts of bravery,\ncould not refrain from admiring this handsome lad, in the unbuttoned\ncoat, beneath which a red shirt was visible, encircling his soft white\nneck, with his animated face and eyes, as he clapped his hands and\nshouted: "First! Second!" and ran gayly along the ramparts, in order to\nsee where his bomb would fall.\n\nAt half-past eleven the firing ceased on both sides, and at precisely\ntwelve o\'clock the storming of the Malakoff mound, of the second,\nthird, and fifth bastions began.\n\n\nXXIII.\n\nOn this side of the bay, between Inkerman and the northern\nfortifications, on the telegraph hill, about midday, stood two naval\nmen; one was an officer, who was engaged in observing Sevastopol\nthrough a telescope, and the other had just arrived at the\nsignal-station with his orderly.\n\nThe sun stood high and brilliant above the bay, and played with the\nships which floated upon it, and with the moving sails and boats, with\na warm and cheerful glow. The light breeze hardly moved the leaves of\nthe dry oak-shrubs which stood about the signal-pole, puffed out the\nsails of the boats, and ruffled the waves.\n\nSevastopol, with her unfinished church, her columns, her line of\nshore, her boulevard showing green against the hill, and her elegant\nlibrary building, with her tiny azure inlets, filled with masts, with\nthe picturesque arches of her aqueducts, and the clouds of blue smoke,\nlighted up now and then by red flashes of flame from the firing; the\nsame beautiful, proud, festive Sevastopol, hemmed in on one side by\nyellow, smoke-crowned hills, on the other by the bright blue sea, which\nglittered in the sun, was visible the same as ever, on the other side\nof the bay.\n\nOver the horizon-line of the sea, along which floated a long wreath of\nblack smoke from some steamer, crept long white clouds, portending a\ngale. Along the entire line of the fortifications, especially over the\nhills on the left, rose columns of thick, dense, white smoke; suddenly,\nabruptly, and incessantly illuminated by flashes, lightnings, which\nshone even amid the light of high noon, and which constantly increased\nin volume, assuming divers forms, as they swept upwards, and tinged\nthe heavens. These puffs of smoke flashing now here, now there, took\ntheir birth on the hills, in the batteries of the enemy, in the city,\nand high against the sky. The sound of the discharges never ceased, but\nshook the air with their mingled roar.\n\nAt twelve o\'clock, the puffs of smoke began to occur less and less\nfrequently, and the atmosphere quivered less with the roar.\n\n"But the second bastion is no longer replying at all," said the officer\nof hussars, who sat there on horseback; "it is utterly destroyed!\nHorrible!"\n\n"Yes, and the Malakoff only sends one shot to their three," replied the\nofficer who was looking through his glass. "It enrages me to have them\nsilent. They are firing straight on the Kornilovsky battery, and it is\nnot answering at all."\n\n"But you see that they always cease the bombardment at twelve o\'clock,\njust as I said. It is the same to-day. Let us go and get some breakfast\n... they are already waiting for us ... there\'s nothing to see."\n\n"Stop, don\'t interfere," said the officer with the glass, gazing at\nSevastopol with peculiar eagerness.\n\n"What\'s going on there? What is it?"\n\n"There is a movement in the trenches, and heavy columns are marching."\n\n"Yes, that is evident," said the other. "The columns are under way. We\nmust give the signal."\n\n"See, see! They have emerged from the trenches."\n\nIn truth, it was visible to the naked eye that dark masses were moving\ndown the hill, across the narrow valley, from the French batteries to\nthe bastions. In front of these specks, dark streaks were visible,\nwhich were already close to our lines. White puffs of smoke of\ndischarges burst out at various points on the bastions, as though the\nfiring were running along the line.\n\nThe breeze bore to them the sounds of musketry-shots, exchanged\nbriskly, like rain upon the window-pane. The black streaks moved on,\nnearer and nearer, into the very smoke. The sounds of firing grew\nlouder and louder, and mingled in a lengthened, resounding roar.\n\nThe smoke, rising more and more frequently, spread rapidly along the\nline, flowed together in one lilac-hued cloud, which dispersed and\njoined again, and through which, here and there, flitted flames and\nblack points--and all sounds were commingled in one reverberating crash.\n\n"An assault," said the officer, with a pale face, as he handed the\nglass to the naval officer.\n\nOrderlies galloped along the road, officers on horseback, the\ncommander-in-chief in a calash, and his suite passed by. Profound\nemotion and expectation were visible on all countenances.\n\n"It cannot be that they have taken it!" said the mounted officer.\n\n"By Heavens, there\'s the standard! Look, look!" said the other, sighing\nand abandoning the glass. "The French standard on the Malakoff!"\n\n"It cannot be!"\n\n\nXXIV.\n\nThe elder Kozeltzoff, who had succeeded in winning back his money and\nlosing it all again that night, including even the gold pieces which\nwere sewed into his cuffs, had fallen, just before daybreak, into a\nheavy, unhealthy, but profound slumber, in the fortified barracks of\nthe fifth battalion, when the fateful cry, repeated by various voices,\nrang out:--\n\n"The alarm!"\n\n"Why are you sleeping, Mikhail Semyonitch! There\'s an assault!" a voice\nshouted to him.\n\n"That is probably some school-boy," he said, opening his eyes, but\nputting no faith in it.\n\nBut all at once he caught sight of an officer running aimlessly from\none corner to the other, with such a pale face that he understood it\nall. The thought that he might be taken for a coward, who did not wish\nto go out to his company at a critical moment, struck him with terrible\nforce. He ran to his corps at the top of his speed. Firing had ceased\nfrom the heavy guns; but the crash of musketry was at its height. The\nbullets whistled, not singly like rifle-balls, but in swarms, like a\nflock of birds in autumn, flying past overhead. The entire spot on\nwhich his battalion had stood the night before was veiled in smoke, and\nthe shouts and cries of the enemy were audible. Soldiers, both wounded\nand unwounded, met him in throngs. After running thirty paces further,\nhe caught sight of his company, which was hugging the wall.\n\n"They have captured Schwartz," said a young officer. "All is lost!"\n\n"Nonsense!" said he, angrily, grasping his blunt little iron sword, and\nhe began to shout:--\n\n"Forward, children! Hurrah!"\n\nHis voice was strong and ringing; it roused even Kozeltzoff himself.\nHe ran forward along the traverse; fifty soldiers rushed after him,\nshouting as they went. From the traverse he ran out upon an open\nsquare. The bullets fell literally like hail. Two struck him,--but\nwhere, and what they did, whether they bruised or wounded him, he had\nnot the time to decide.\n\nIn front, he could already see blue uniforms and red trousers, and\ncould hear shouts which were not Russian; one Frenchman was standing on\nthe breastworks, waving his cap, and shouting something. Kozeltzoff was\nconvinced that he was about to be killed; this gave him courage.\n\nHe ran on and on. Some soldiers overtook him; other soldiers appeared\nat one side, also running. The blue uniforms remained at the same\ndistance from him, fleeing back from him to their own trenches; but\nbeneath his feet were the dead and wounded. When he had run to the\noutermost ditch, everything became confused before Kozeltzoff\'s eyes,\nand he was conscious of a pain in the breast.\n\nHalf an hour later, he was lying on a stretcher, near the Nikolaevsky\nbarracks, and knew that he was wounded, though he felt hardly any pain;\nall he wanted was something cooling to drink, and to be allowed to lie\nstill in peace.\n\nA plump little doctor, with black side-whiskers, approached him, and\nunbuttoned his coat. Kozeltzoff stared over his chin at what the doctor\nwas doing to his wound, and at the doctor\'s face, but he felt no pain.\nThe doctor covered his wound with his shirt, wiped his fingers on the\nskirts of his coat, and, without a word or glance at the wounded man,\nwent off to some one else.\n\nKozeltzoff\'s eyes mechanically took note of what was going on before\nhim, and, recalling the fact that he had been in the fifth bastion,\nhe thought, with an extraordinary feeling of self-satisfaction, that\nhe had fulfilled his duty well, and that, for the first time in all\nhis service, he had behaved as handsomely as it was possible for any\none, and had nothing with which to reproach himself. The doctor, after\nbandaging the other officer\'s wound, pointed to Kozeltzoff, and said\nsomething to a priest, with a huge reddish beard, and a cross, who was\nstanding near by.\n\n"What! am I dying?" Kozeltzoff asked the priest, when the latter\napproached him.\n\nThe priest, without making any reply, recited a prayer and handed the\ncross to the wounded man.\n\nDeath had no terrors for Kozeltzoff. He grasped the cross with his weak\nhands, pressed it to his lips, and burst into tears.\n\n"Well, were the French repulsed?" he inquired of the priest, in firm\ntones.\n\n"The victory has remained with us at every point," replied the priest,\nin order to comfort the wounded man, concealing from him the fact that\nthe French standard had already been unfurled on the Malakoff mound.\n\n"Thank God!" said the wounded man, without feeling the tears which were\ntrickling down his cheeks.\n\nThe thought of his brother occurred to his mind for a single instant.\n"May God grant him the same good-fortune," he said to himself.\n\n\nXXV.\n\nBut the same fate did not await Volodya. He was listening to a tale\nwhich Vasin was in the act of relating to him, when there was a\ncry,--"The French are coming!" The blood fled for a moment to Volodya\'s\nheart, and he felt his cheeks turn cold and pale. For one second he\nremained motionless, but, on glancing about him, he perceived that\nthe soldiers were buttoning up their coats with tolerable equanimity,\nand crawling out, one after the other. One even, probably Melnikoff,\nremarked, in a jesting way:--\n\n"Go out and offer them the bread and salt of hospitality, children!"\n\nVolodya, in company with Vlang, who never separated from him by so much\nas a step, crawled out of the bomb-proof, and ran to the battery.\n\nThere was no artillery firing whatever in progress on either side. It\nwas not so much the sight of the soldiers\' composure which aroused\nhis courage as the pitiful and undisguised cowardice of Vlang. "Is\nit possible for me to be like him?" he said to himself, and he ran\non gayly up to the breastworks, near which his mortars stood. It was\nclearly apparent to him that the French were making straight for him\nthrough an open space, and that masses of them, with their bayonets\nglittering in the sun, were moving in the nearest trenches.\n\nOne, a short, broad-shouldered fellow, in zouave uniform, and armed\nwith a sword, ran on in front and leaped the ditch.\n\n"Fire grape-shot!" shouted Volodya, hastening from the banquette;\nbut the soldiers had already made their preparations without waiting\nfor his orders, and the metallic sound of the grape-shot which they\ndischarged shrieked over his head, first from one and then from the\nother mortar.\n\n"First! second!" commanded Volodya, running from one mortar to the\nother, and utterly oblivious of danger.\n\nOn one side, and near at hand, the crash of musketry from our men under\nshelter, and anxious cries, were heard.\n\nAll at once a startling cry of despair, repeated by several voices, was\nheard on the left: "They are surrounding us! They are surrounding us!"\n\nVolodya looked round at this shout. Twenty Frenchmen made their\nappearance in the rear. One of them, a handsome man with a black beard,\nwas in front of all; but, after running up to within ten paces of the\nbattery, he halted, and fired straight at Volodya, and then ran towards\nhim once more.\n\nFor a second, Volodya stood as though turned to stone, and did not\nbelieve his eyes. When he recovered himself and glanced about him,\nthere were blue uniforms in front of him on the ramparts; two Frenchmen\nwere even spiking a cannon not ten paces distant from him.\n\nThere was no one near him, with the exception of Melnikoff, who had\nbeen killed by a bullet beside him, and Vlang, who, with a handspike\nclutched in his hand, had rushed forwards, with an expression of wrath\non his face, and with eyes lowered.\n\n"Follow me, Vladimir Semyonitch! Follow me!" shouted the desperate\nvoice of Vlang, as he brandished his handspike over the French, who\nwere pouring in from the rear. The yunker\'s ferocious countenance\nstartled them. He struck the one who was in advance, on the head; the\nothers involuntarily paused, and Vlang continued to glare about him,\nand to shout in despairing accents: "Follow me, Vladimir Semyonitch!\nWhy do you stand there? Run!" and ran towards the trenches in which lay\nour infantry, firing at the French. After leaping into the trench, he\ncame out again to see what his adored ensign was doing. Something in a\ncoat was lying prostrate where Volodya had been standing, and the whole\nplace was filled with Frenchmen, who were firing at our men.\n\n\nXXVI.\n\nVlang found his battery on the second line of defence. Out of the\ntwenty soldiers who had been in the mortar battery, only eight survived.\n\nAt nine o\'clock in the evening, Vlang set out with the battery on a\nsteamer loaded down with soldiers, cannon, horses, and wounded men, for\nSevernaya.\n\nThere was no firing anywhere. The stars shone brilliantly in the\nsky, as on the preceding night; but a strong wind tossed the sea. On\nthe first and second bastions, lightnings flashed along the earth;\nexplosions rent the atmosphere, and illuminated strange black objects\nin their vicinity, and the stones which flew through the air.\n\nSomething was burning near the docks, and the red glare was reflected\nin the water. The bridge, covered with people, was lighted up by the\nfire from the Nikolaevsky battery. A vast flame seemed to hang over the\nwater, from the distant promontory of the Alexandrovsky battery, and\nilluminated the clouds of smoke beneath, as it rose above them; and\nthe same tranquil, insolent, distant lights as on the preceding evening\ngleamed over the sea, from the hostile fleet.\n\nThe fresh breeze raised billows in the bay. By the red light of the\nconflagrations, the masts of our sunken ships, which were settling\ndeeper and deeper into the water, were visible. Not a sound of\nconversation was heard on deck; there was nothing but the regular swish\nof the parted waves, and the steam, the neighing and pawing of the\nhorses, the words of command from the captain, and the groans of the\nwounded. Vlang, who had had nothing to eat all day, drew a bit of bread\nfrom his pocket, and began to chew it; but all at once he recalled\nVolodya, and burst into such loud weeping that the soldiers who were\nnear him heard it.\n\n"See how our Vlang_a_[N] is eating his bread and crying too," said\nVasin.\n\n[N] The feminine form, as previously referred to.\n\n"Wonderful!" said another.\n\n"And see, they have fired our barracks," he continued, with a sigh.\n"And how many of our brothers perished there; and the French got it for\nnothing!"\n\n"At all events, we have got out of it alive--thank God for that!" said\nVasin.\n\n"But it\'s provoking, all the same!"\n\n"What is there provoking about it? Do you suppose they are enjoying\nthemselves there? Not exactly! You wait, our men will take it away from\nthem again. And however many of our brethren perish, as God is holy, if\nthe emperor commands, they will win it back. Can ours leave it to them\nthus? Never! There you have the bare walls; but they have destroyed all\nthe breastworks. Even if they have planted their standard on the hill,\nthey won\'t be able to make their way into the town."\n\n"Just wait, we\'ll have a hearty reckoning with you yet, only give us\ntime," he concluded, addressing himself to the French.\n\n"Of course we will!" said another, with conviction.\n\nAlong the whole line of bastions of Sevastopol, which had for so many\nmonths seethed with remarkably vigorous life, which had for so many\nmonths seen dying heroes relieved one after another by death, and which\nhad for so many months awakened the terror, the hatred, and finally\nthe admiration of the enemy,--on the bastions of Sevastopol, there was\nno longer a single man. All was dead, wild, horrible,--but not silent.\n\nDestruction was still in progress. On the earth, furrowed and strewn\nwith the recent explosions, lay bent gun-carriages, crushing down the\nbodies of Russians and of the foe; heavy iron cannons silenced forever,\nbombs and cannon-balls hurled with horrible force into pits, and\nhalf-buried in the soil, then more corpses, pits, splinters of beams,\nbomb-proofs, and still more silent bodies in gray and blue coats. All\nthese were still frequently shaken and lighted up by the crimson glow\nof the explosions, which continued to shock the air.\n\nThe foe perceived that something incomprehensible was going on in that\nmenacing Sevastopol. Those explosions and the death-like silence on\nthe bastions made them shudder; but they dared not yet believe, being\nstill under the influence of the calm and forcible resistance of the\nday, that their invincible enemy had disappeared, and they awaited\nmotionless and in silence the end of that gloomy night.\n\nThe army of Sevastopol, like the gloomy, surging sea, quivering\nthroughout its entire mass, wavering, ploughing across the bay, on\nthe bridge, and at the north fortifications, moved slowly through the\nimpenetrable darkness of the night; away from the place where it had\nleft so many of its brave brethren, from the place all steeped in its\nblood, from the place which it had defended for eleven months against\na foe twice as powerful as itself, and which it was now ordered to\nabandon without a battle.\n\nThe first impression produced on every Russian by this command was\ninconceivably sad. The second feeling was a fear of pursuit. The men\nfelt that they were defenceless as soon as they abandoned the places on\nwhich they were accustomed to fight, and they huddled together uneasily\nin the dark, at the entrance to the bridge, which was swaying about in\nthe heavy breeze.\n\nThe infantry pressed forward, with a clash of bayonets, and a\nthronging of regiments, equipages, and arms; cavalry officers made\ntheir way about with orders, the inhabitants and the military servants\naccompanying the baggage wept and besought to be permitted to cross,\nwhile the artillery, in haste to get off, forced their way to the bay\nwith a thunder of wheels.\n\nIn spite of the diversions created by the varied and anxious demands\non their attention, the instinct of self-preservation and the desire\nto escape as speedily as possible from that dread place of death were\npresent in every soul. This instinct existed also in a soldier mortally\nwounded, who lay among the five hundred other wounded, upon the stone\npavement of the Pavlovsky quay, and prayed God to send death; and in\nthe militia-man, who with his last remaining strength pressed into\nthe compact throng, in order to make way for a general who rode by,\nand in the general in charge of the transportation, who was engaged\nin restraining the haste of the soldiers, and in the sailor, who had\nbecome entangled in the moving battalion, and who, crushed by the\nsurging throng, had lost his breath, and in the wounded officer, who\nwas being borne along in a litter by four soldiers, who, stopped by the\ncrowd, had placed him on the ground by the Nikolaevsky battery, and in\nthe artillery-man, who had served his gun for sixteen years, and who,\nat his superior\'s command, to him incomprehensible, to throw overboard\nthe guns, had, with the aid of his comrades, sent them over the steep\nbank into the bay; and in the men of the fleet, who had just closed the\nport-holes of the ships, and had rowed lustily away in their boats.\nOn stepping upon the further end of the bridge, nearly every soldier\npulled off his cap and crossed himself.\n\nBut behind this instinct there was another, oppressive and far deeper,\nexisting along with it; this was a feeling which resembled repentance,\nshame, and hatred. Almost every soldier, as he gazed on abandoned\nSevastopol, from the northern shore, sighed with inexpressible\nbitterness of heart, and menaced the foe.\n\n\n\n\nPUBLICATIONS\n\nOF\n\nTHOMAS Y.

It is dark on board the ships; it has just struck eight bells.\n\nToward the north the activity of the day begins gradually to replace\nthe nocturnal quiet; here the relief guard has passed clanking their\narms, there the doctor is already hastening to the hospital, further on\nthe soldier has crept out of his earth hut and is washing his sunburnt\nface in ice-encrusted water, and, turning towards the crimsoning east,\ncrosses himself quickly as he prays to God; here a tall and heavy\ncamel-wagon has dragged creaking to the cemetery, to bury the bloody\ndead, with whom it is laden nearly to the top. You go to the wharf--a\npeculiar odor of coal, manure, dampness, and of beef strikes you;\nthousands of objects of all sorts--wood, meat, gabions, flour, iron, and\nso forth--lie in heaps about the wharf; soldiers of various regiments,\nwith knapsacks and muskets, without knapsacks and without muskets,\nthrong thither, smoke, quarrel, drag weights aboard the steamer which\nlies smoking beside the quay; unattached two-oared boats, filled with\nall sorts of people,--soldiers, sailors, merchants, women,--land at and\nleave the wharf.\n\n"To the Grafsky, Your Excellency? be so good." Two or three retired\nsailors rise in their boats and offer you their services.\n\nYou select the one who is nearest to you, you step over the\nhalf-decomposed carcass of a brown horse, which lies there in the mud\nbeside the boat, and reach the stern. You quit the shore. All about\nyou is the sea, already glittering in the morning sun, in front of you\nis an aged sailor, in a camel\'s-hair coat, and a young, white-headed\nboy, who work zealously and in silence at the oars. You gaze at the\nmotley vastness of the vessels, scattered far and near over the bay,\nand at the small black dots of boats moving about on the shining\nazure expanse, and at the bright and beautiful buildings of the city,\ntinted with the rosy rays of the morning sun, which are visible in one\ndirection, and at the foaming white line of the quay, and the sunken\nships from which black tips of masts rise sadly here and there, and\nat the distant fleet of the enemy faintly visible as they rock on the\ncrystal horizon of the sea, and at the streaks of foam on which leap\nsalt bubbles beaten up by the oars; you listen to the monotonous sound\nof voices which fly to you over the water, and the grand sounds of\nfiring, which, as it seems to you, is increasing in Sevastopol.\n\nIt cannot be that, at the thought that you too are in Sevastopol, a\ncertain feeling of manliness, of pride, has not penetrated your soul,\nand that the blood has not begun to flow more swiftly through your\nveins.\n\n"Your Excellency! you are steering straight into the Kistentin,"[A]\nsays your old sailor to you as he turns round to make sure of the\ndirection which you are imparting to the boat, with the rudder to the\nright.\n\n[A] The vessel Constantine.\n\n"And all the cannon are still on it," remarks the white-headed boy,\ncasting a glance over the ship as we pass.\n\n"Of course; it\'s new. Korniloff lived on board of it," said the old\nman, also glancing at the ship.\n\n"See where it has burst!" says the boy, after a long silence, looking\nat a white cloud of spreading smoke which has suddenly appeared high\nover the South Bay, accompanied by the sharp report of an exploding\nbomb.\n\n"_He_ is firing to-day with his new battery," adds the old man, calmly\nspitting on his hands. "Now, give way, Mishka! we\'ll overtake the\nbarge." And your boat moves forward more swiftly over the broad swells\nof the bay, and you actually do overtake the heavy barge, upon which\nsome bags are piled, and which is rowed by awkward soldiers, and it\ntouches the Grafsky wharf amid a multitude of boats of every sort which\nare landing.\n\nThrongs of gray soldiers, black sailors, and women of various colors\nmove noisily along the shore. The women are selling rolls, Russian\npeasants with samovars are crying _hot sbiten_;[B] and here upon the\nfirst steps are strewn rusted cannon-balls, bombs, grape-shot, and\ncast-iron cannon of various calibers; a little further on is a large\nsquare, upon which lie huge beams, gun-carriages, sleeping soldiers;\nthere stand horses, wagons, green guns, ammunition-chests, and stacks\nof arms; soldiers, sailors, officers, women, children, and merchants\nare moving about; carts are arriving with hay, bags, and casks; here\nand there Cossacks make their way through, or officers on horseback,\nor a general in a drosky. To the right, the street is hemmed in by a\nbarricade, in whose embrasures stand some small cannon, and beside\nthese sits a sailor smoking his pipe. On the left a handsome house\nwith Roman ciphers on the pediment, beneath which stand soldiers and\nblood-stained litters--everywhere you behold the unpleasant signs of\na war encampment. Your first impression is inevitably of the most\ndisagreeable sort. The strange mixture of camp and town life, of a\nbeautiful city and a dirty bivouac, is not only not beautiful, but\nseems repulsive disorder; it even seems to you that every one is\nthoroughly frightened, and is fussing about without knowing what he\nis doing. But look more closely at the faces of these people who are\nmoving about you, and you will gain an entirely different idea. Look at\nthis little soldier from the provinces, for example, who is leading a\ntroika of brown horses to water, and is purring something to himself so\ncomposedly that he evidently will not go astray in this motley crowd,\nwhich does not exist for him; but he is fulfilling his duty, whatever\nthat may be,--watering the horses or carrying arms,--with just as much\ncomposure, self-confidence, and equanimity as though it were taking\nplace in Tula or Saransk. You will read the same expression on the face\nof this officer who passes by in immaculate white gloves, and in the\nface of the sailor who is smoking as he sits on the barricade, and in\nthe faces of the working soldiers, waiting with their litters on the\nsteps of the former club, and in the face of yonder girl, who, fearing\nto wet her pink gown, skips across the street on the little stones.\n\n[B] A drink made of water, molasses, laurel-leaves or salvia, which is\ndrunk like tea, especially by the lower classes.\n\nYes! disenchantment certainly awaits you, if you are entering\nSevastopol for the first time. In vain will you seek, on even a\nsingle countenance, for traces of anxiety, discomposure, or even of\nenthusiasm, readiness for death, decision,--there is nothing of the\nsort. You will see the tradespeople quietly engaged in the duties\nof their callings, so that, possibly, you may reproach yourself for\nsuperfluous raptures, you may entertain some doubt as to the justice\nof the ideas regarding the heroism of the defenders of Sevastopol\nwhich you have formed from stories, descriptions, and the sights\nand sounds on the northern side. But, before you doubt, go upon the\nbastions, observe the defenders of Sevastopol on the very scene of\nthe defence, or, better still, go straight across into that house,\nwhich was formerly the Sevastopol Assembly House, and upon whose roof\nstand soldiers with litters,--there you will behold the defenders\nof Sevastopol, there you will behold frightful and sad, great and\nlaughable, but wonderful sights, which elevate the soul.\n\nYou enter the great Hall of Assembly. You have but just opened the door\nwhen the sight and smell of forty or fifty seriously wounded men and\nof those who have undergone amputation--some in hammocks, the majority\nupon the floor--suddenly strike you. Trust not to the feeling which\ndetains you upon the threshold of the hall; be not ashamed of having\ncome to _look at_ the sufferers, be not ashamed to approach and address\nthem: the unfortunates like to see a sympathizing human face, they like\nto tell of their sufferings and to hear words of love and interest. You\nwalk along between the beds and seek a face less stern and suffering,\nwhich you decide to approach, with the object of conversing.\n\n"Where are you wounded?" you inquire, timidly and with indecision, of\nan old, gaunt soldier, who, seated in his hammock, is watching you with\na good-natured glance, and seems to invite you to approach him. I say\n"you ask timidly," because these sufferings inspire you, over and above\nthe feeling of profound sympathy, with a fear of offending and with a\nlofty reverence for the man who has undergone them.\n\n"In the leg," replies the soldier; but, at the same time, you perceive,\nby the folds of the coverlet, that he has lost his leg above the knee.\n"God be thanked now," he adds,--"I shall get my discharge."\n\n"Were you wounded long ago?"\n\n"It was six weeks ago, Your Excellency."\n\n"Does it still pain you?"\n\n"No, there\'s no pain now; only there\'s a sort of gnawing in my calf\nwhen the weather is bad, but that\'s nothing."\n\n"How did you come to be wounded?"\n\n"On the fifth bastion, during the first bombardment. I had just trained\na cannon, and was on the point of going away, so, to another embrasure\nwhen _it_ struck me in the leg, just as if I had stepped into a hole\nand had no leg."\n\n"Was it not painful at the first moment?"\n\n"Not at all; only as though something boiling hot had struck my leg."\n\n"Well, and then?"\n\n"And then--nothing; only the skin began to draw as though it had been\nrubbed hard. The first thing of all, Your Excellency, _is not to think\nat all_. If you don\'t think about a thing, it amounts to nothing. Men\nsuffer from thinking more than from anything else."\n\nAt that moment, a woman in a gray striped dress and a black kerchief\nbound about her head approaches you.\n\nShe joins in your conversation with the sailor, and begins to tell\nabout him, about his sufferings, his desperate condition for the space\nof four weeks, and how, when he was wounded, he made the litter halt\nthat he might see the volley from our battery, how the grand-duke spoke\nto him and gave him twenty-five rubles, and how he said to him that he\nwanted to go back to the bastion to direct the younger men, even if he\ncould not work himself. As she says all this in a breath, the woman\nglances now at you, now at the sailor, who has turned away as though\nhe did not hear her and plucks some lint from his pillow, and her eyes\nsparkle with peculiar enthusiasm.\n\n"This is my housewife, Your Excellency!" the sailor says to you, with\nan expression which seems to say, "You must excuse her. Every one knows\nit\'s a woman\'s way--she\'s talking nonsense."\n\nYou begin to understand the defenders of Sevastopol. For some reason,\nyou feel ashamed of yourself in the presence of this man. You would\nlike to say a very great deal to him, in order to express to him your\nsympathy and admiration; but you find no words, or you are dissatisfied\nwith those which come into your head,--and you do reverence in silence\nbefore this taciturn, unconscious grandeur and firmness of soul, this\nmodesty in the face of his own merits.\n\n"Well, God grant you a speedy recovery," you say to him, and you halt\nbefore another invalid, who is lying on the floor and appears to be\nawaiting death in intolerable agony.\n\nHe is a blond man with pale, swollen face. He is lying on his back,\nwith his left arm thrown out, in a position which is expressive of\ncruel suffering. His parched, open mouth with difficulty emits his\nstertorous breathing; his blue, leaden eyes are rolled up, and from\nbeneath the wadded coverlet the remains of his right arm, enveloped\nin bandages, protrude. The oppressive odor of a corpse strikes you\nforcibly, and the consuming, internal fire which has penetrated every\nlimb of the sufferer seems to penetrate you also.\n\n"Is he unconscious?" you inquire of the woman, who comes up to you and\ngazes at you tenderly as at a relative.\n\n"No, he can still hear, but he\'s very bad," she adds, in a whisper. "I\ngave him some tea to-day,--what if he is a stranger, one must still have\npity!--and he hardly tasted it."\n\n"How do you feel?" you ask him.\n\nThe wounded man turns his eyeballs at the sound of your voice, but he\nneither sees nor understands you.\n\n"There\'s a gnawing at my heart."\n\nA little further on, you see an old soldier changing his linen. His\nface and body are of a sort of cinnamon-brown color, and gaunt as a\nskeleton. He has no arm at all; it has been cut off at the shoulder. He\nis sitting with a wide-awake air, he puts himself to rights; but you\nsee, by his dull, corpse-like gaze, his frightful gauntness, and the\nwrinkles on his face, that he is a being who has suffered for the best\npart of his life.\n\nOn the other side, you behold in a cot the pale, suffering, and\ndelicate face of a woman, upon whose cheek plays a feverish flush.\n\n"That\'s our little sailor lass who was struck in the leg by a bomb on\nthe 5th," your guide tells you. "She was carrying her husband\'s dinner\nto him in the bastion."\n\n"Has it been amputated?"\n\n"They cut it off above the knee."\n\nNow, if your nerves are strong, pass through the door on the left.\nIn yonder room they are applying bandages and performing operations.\nThere, you will see doctors with their arms blood-stained above the\nelbow, and with pale, stern faces, busied about a cot, upon which, with\neyes widely opened, and uttering, as in delirium, incoherent, sometimes\nsimple and touching words, lies a wounded man under the influence of\nchloroform. The doctors are busy with the repulsive but beneficent\nwork of amputation. You see the sharp, curved knife enter the healthy,\nwhite body, you see the wounded man suddenly regain consciousness with\na piercing cry and curses, you see the army surgeon fling the amputated\narm into a corner, you see another wounded man, lying in a litter in\nthe same apartment, shrink convulsively and groan as he gazes at the\noperation upon his comrade, not so much from physical pain as from the\nmoral torture of anticipation.--You behold the frightful, soul-stirring\nscenes; you behold war, not from its conventional, beautiful, and\nbrilliant side, with music and drum-beat, with fluttering flags and\ngalloping generals, but you behold war in its real phase--in blood, in\nsuffering, in death.\n\nOn emerging from this house of pain, you will infallibly experience\na sensation of pleasure, you will inhale the fresh air more fully,\nyou will feel satisfaction in the consciousness of your health, but,\nat the same time, you will draw from the sight of these sufferings a\nconsciousness of your nothingness, and you will go calmly and without\nany indecision to the bastion.\n\n"What do the death and sufferings of such an insignificant worm as I\nsignify in comparison with so many deaths and such great sufferings?"\nBut the sight of the clear sky, the brilliant sun, the fine city, the\nopen church, and the soldiers moving about in various directions soon\nrestores your mind to its normal condition of frivolity, petty cares,\nand absorption in the present alone.\n\nPerhaps you meet the funeral procession of some officer coming from the\nchurch, with rose-colored coffin, and music and fluttering banners;\nperhaps the sounds of firing reach your ear from the bastion, but this\ndoes not lead you back to your former thoughts; the funeral seems to\nyou a very fine military spectacle, and you do not connect with this\nspectacle, or with the sounds, any clear idea of suffering and death,\nas you did at the point where the bandaging was going on.\n\nPassing the barricade and the church, you come to the most lively part\nof the city. On both sides hang the signs of shops and inns. Merchants,\nwomen in bonnets and kerchiefs, dandified officers,--everything speaks\nto you of the firmness of spirit, of the independence and the security\nof the inhabitants.\n\nEnter the inn on the right if you wish to hear the conversations of\nsailors and officers; stories of the preceding night are sure to be in\nprogress there, and of Fenka, and the affair of the 24th, and of the\ndearness and badness of cutlets, and of such and such a comrade who has\nbeen killed.\n\n"Devil take it, how bad things are with us to-day!" ejaculates the bass\nvoice of a beardless naval officer, with white brows and lashes, in a\ngreen knitted sash.\n\n"Where?" asks another.\n\n"In the fourth bastion," replies the young officer, and you are\ncertain to look at the white-lashed officer with great attention, and\neven with some respect, at the words, "in the fourth bastion." His\nexcessive ease of manner, the way he flourishes his hands, his loud\nlaugh, and his voice, which seems to you insolent, reveal to you that\npeculiar boastful frame of mind which some very young men acquire\nafter danger; nevertheless, you think he is about to tell you how bad\nthe condition of things on the fourth bastion is because of the bombs\nand balls. Nothing of the sort! things are bad because it is muddy.\n"It\'s impossible to pass through the battery," says he, pointing at\nhis boots, which are covered with mud above the calf. "And my best\ngun-captain was killed to-day; he was struck plump in the forehead,"\nsays another. "Who\'s that? Mitiukhin?" "No!... What now, are they going\nto give me any veal? the villains!" he adds to the servant of the inn.\n"Not Mitiukhin, but Abrosimoff. Such a fine young fellow!--he was in the\nsixth sally."\n\nAt another corner of the table, over a dish of cutlets with peas, and\na bottle of sour Crimean wine called "Bordeaux," sit two infantry\nofficers; one with a red collar, who is young and has two stars on his\ncoat, is telling the other, with a black collar and no stars, about the\naffair at Alma. The former has already drunk a good deal, and it is\nevident, from the breaks in his narrative, from his undecided glance\nexpressive of doubt as to whether he is believed, and chiefly from\nthe altogether too prominent part which he has played in it all, and\nfrom the excessive horror of it all, that he is strongly disinclined\nto bear strict witness to the truth. But these tales, which you will\nhear for a long time to come in every corner of Russia, are nothing\nto you; you prefer to go to the bastions, especially to the fourth,\nof which you have heard so many and such diverse things. When any one\nsays that he has been in the fourth bastion, he says it with a peculiar\nair of pride and satisfaction; when any one says, "I am going to the\nfourth bastion," either a little agitation or a very great indifference\nis infallibly perceptible in him; when any one wants to jest about\nanother, he says, "You must be stationed in the fourth bastion;" when\nyou meet litters and inquire whence they come, the answer is generally,\n"From the fourth bastion." On the whole, two totally different opinions\nexist with regard to this terrible bastion; one is held by those who\nhave never been in it, and who are convinced that the fourth bastion is\na regular grave for every one who enters it, and the other by those\nwho live in it, like the white-lashed midshipman, and who, when they\nmention the fourth bastion, will tell you whether it is dry or muddy\nthere, whether it is warm or cold in the mud hut, and so forth.\n\nDuring the half-hour which you have passed in the inn, the weather has\nchanged; a fog which before spread over the sea has collected into\ndamp, heavy, gray clouds, and has veiled the sun; a kind of melancholy,\nfrozen mist sprinkles from above, and wets the roofs, the sidewalks,\nand the soldiers\' overcoats.\n\nPassing by yet another barricade, you emerge from the door at the right\nand ascend the principal street. Behind this barricade, the houses are\nunoccupied on both sides of the street, there are no signs, the doors\nare covered with boards, the windows are broken in; here the corners\nare broken away, there the roofs are pierced. The buildings seem to\nbe old, to have undergone every sort of vicissitude and deprivation\ncharacteristic of veterans, and appear to gaze proudly and somewhat\nscornfully upon you. You stumble over the cannon-balls which strew\nthe way, and into holes filled with water, which have been excavated\nin the stony ground by the bombs. In the street you meet and overtake\nbodies of soldiers, sharpshooters, officers; now and then you encounter\na woman or a child, but it is no longer a woman in a bonnet, but a\nsailor\'s daughter in an old fur cloak and soldier\'s boots. As you\nproceed along the street, and descend a small declivity, you observe\nthat there are no longer any houses about you, but only some strange\nheaps of ruined stones, boards, clay, and beams; ahead of you, upon a\nsteep hill, you perceive a black, muddy expanse, intersected by canals,\nand this that is in front is the fourth bastion. Here you meet still\nfewer people, no women are visible, the soldiers walk briskly, you come\nacross drops of blood on the road, and you will certainly encounter\nthere four soldiers with a stretcher and upon the stretcher a pale\nyellowish face and a blood-stained overcoat. If you inquire, "Where\nis he wounded?" the bearers will say angrily, without turning towards\nyou, "In the leg or the arm," if he is slightly wounded, or they will\npreserve a gloomy silence if no head is visible on the stretcher and he\nis already dead or badly hurt.\n\nThe shriek of a cannon-ball or a bomb close by surprises you\nunpleasantly, as you ascend the hill. You understand all at once,\nand quite differently from what you have before, the significance of\nthose sounds of shots which you heard in the city. A quietly cheerful\nmemory flashes suddenly before your fancy; your own personality begins\nto occupy you more than your observations; your attention to all\nthat surrounds you diminishes, and a certain disagreeable feeling of\nuncertainty suddenly overmasters you. In spite of this decidedly base\nvoice, which suddenly speaks within you, at the sight of danger, you\nforce it to be silent, especially when you glance at a soldier who\nruns laughing past you at a trot, waving his hands, and slipping down\nthe hill in the mud, and you involuntarily expand your chest, throw up\nyour head a little higher, and climb the slippery, clayey hill. As soon\nas you have reached the top, rifle-balls begin to whiz to the right\nand left of you, and, possibly, you begin to reflect whether you will\nnot go into the trench which runs parallel with the road; but this\ntrench is full of such yellow, liquid, foul-smelling mud, more than\nknee-deep, that you will infallibly choose the path on the hill, the\nmore so as you see that _every one uses the path_. After traversing a\ncouple of hundred paces, you emerge upon a muddy expanse, all ploughed\nup, and surrounded on all sides by gabions, earthworks, platforms,\nearth huts, upon which great cast-iron guns stand, and cannon-balls\nlie in symmetrical heaps. All these seem to be heaped up without any\naim, connection, or order. Here in the battery sit a knot of sailors;\nthere in the middle of the square, half buried in mud, lies a broken\ncannon; further on, a foot-soldier, with his gun, is marching through\nthe battery, and dragging his feet with difficulty through the sticky\nsoil. But everywhere, on all sides, in every spot, you see broken\ndishes, unexploded bombs, cannon-balls, signs of encampment, all sunk\nin the liquid, viscous mud. You seem to hear not far from you the thud\nof a cannon-ball; on all sides, you seem to hear the varied sounds\nof balls,--humming like bees, whistling sharply, or in a whine like a\ncord--you hear the frightful roar of the fusillade, which seems to shake\nyou all through with some horrible fright.\n\n"So this is it, the fourth bastion, this is it--that terrible, really\nfrightful place!" you think to yourself, and you experience a little\nsensation of pride, and a very large sensation of suppressed terror.\nBut you are mistaken, this is not the fourth bastion. It is the\nYazonovsky redoubt--a place which is comparatively safe; and not at all\ndreadful.\n\nIn order to reach the fourth bastion, you turn to the right, through\nthis narrow trench, through which the foot-soldier has gone. In this\ntrench you will perhaps meet stretchers again, sailors and soldiers\nwith shovels; you will see the superintendent of the mines, mud huts,\ninto which only two men can crawl by bending down, and there you will\nsee sharpshooters of the Black Sea battalions, who are changing their\nshoes, eating, smoking their pipes, and living; and you will still see\neverywhere that same stinking mud, traces of a camp, and cast-off iron\ndebris in every possible form. Proceeding yet three hundred paces,\nyou will emerge again upon a battery,--on an open space, all cut up\ninto holes and surrounded by gabions, covered with earth, cannon, and\nearthworks. Here you will perhaps see five sailors playing cards under\nthe shelter of the breastworks, and a naval officer who, perceiving\nthat you are a new-comer, and curious, will with pleasure show his\nhousehold arrangements, and everything which may be of interest to you.\n\nThis officer rolls himself a cigarette of yellow paper, with so much\ncomposure as he sits on a gun, walks so calmly from one embrasure\nto another, converses with you so quietly, without the slightest\naffectation, that, in spite of the bullets which hum above you\neven more thickly than before, you become cool yourself, question\nattentively, and listen to the officer\'s replies.\n\nThis officer will tell you, but only if you ask him, about the\nbombardment on the 5th, he will tell you how only one gun in his\nbattery could be used, and out of all the gunners who served it only\neight remained, and how, nevertheless, on the next morning, the 6th, he\nfired all the guns; he will tell you how a bomb fell upon a sailor\'s\nearth hut on the 5th, and laid low eleven men; he will point out to\nyou, from the embrasures, the enemy\'s batteries and entrenchments,\nwhich are not more than thirty or forty fathoms distant from this\npoint. I fear, however, that, under the influence of the whizzing\nbullets, you may thrust yourself out of the embrasure in order to view\nthe enemy; you will see nothing, and, if you do see anything, you will\nbe very much surprised that that white stone wall, which is so near you\nand from which white smoke rises in puffs,--that that white wall is the\nenemy--_he_, as the soldiers and sailors say.\n\nIt is even quite possible that the naval officer will want to discharge\na shot or two in your presence, out of vanity or simply for his own\npleasure. "Send the captain and his crew to the cannon;" and fourteen\nsailors step up briskly and merrily to the gun and load it--one\nthrusting his pipe into his pocket, another one chewing a biscuit,\nstill another clattering his heels on the platform.\n\nObserve the faces, the bearing, the movements of these men. In every\nwrinkle of that sunburned face, with its high cheek-bones, in every\nmuscle, in the breadth of those shoulders, in the stoutness of those\nlegs shod in huge boots, in every calm, firm, deliberate gesture,\nthese chief traits which constitute the power of Russia--simplicity\nand straightforwardness--are visible; but here, on every face, it\nseems to you that the danger, misery, and the sufferings of war\nhave, in addition to these principal characteristics, left traces of\nconsciousness of personal worth, emotion, and exalted thought.\n\nAll at once a frightful roar, which shakes not your organs of hearing\nalone but your whole being, startles you so that you tremble all over.\nThen you hear the distant shriek of the shot as it pursues its course,\nand the dense smoke of the powder conceals from you the platform and\nthe black figures of the sailors who are moving about upon it. You\nhear various remarks of the sailors in reference to this shot, and you\nsee their animation, and an exhibition of a feeling which you had not\nexpected to behold perhaps--a feeling of malice, of revenge against\nthe enemy, which lies hidden in the soul of each man. "It struck the\nembrasure itself; it seems to have killed two men--see, they\'ve carried\nthem off!" you hear in joyful exclamation. "And now they are angry;\nthey\'ll fire at us directly," says some one; and, in fact, shortly\nafter you see a flash in front and smoke; the sentry, who is standing\non the breastwork, shouts "Can-non!" And then the ball shrieks past\nyou, strikes the earth, and scatters a shower of dirt and stones about\nit.\n\nThis ball enrages the commander of the battery; he orders a second and\na third gun to be loaded, the enemy also begins to reply to us, and\nyou experience a sensation of interest, you hear and see interesting\nthings. Again the sentry shouts, "Can-non!" and you hear the same\nreport and blow, the same shower, or he shouts "Mortar!" and you hear\nthe monotonous, even rather pleasant whistle of the bomb, with which it\nis difficult to connect the thought of horror; you hear this whistle\napproaching you, and increasing in swiftness, then you see the black\nsphere, the impact on the ground, the resounding explosion of the bomb\nwhich can be felt. With the whistle and shriek, splinters fly again,\nstones whiz through the air, and mud showers over you. At these sounds\nyou experience a strange feeling of enjoyment, and, at the same time,\nof terror. At the moment when you know that the projectile is flying\ntowards you, it will infallibly occur to you that this shot will kill\nyou; but the feeling of self-love upholds you, and no one perceives\nthe knife which is cutting your heart. But when the shot has flown\npast without touching you, you grow animated, and a certain cheerful,\ninexpressibly pleasant feeling overpowers you, but only for a moment,\nso that you discover a peculiar sort of charm in danger, in this game\nof life and death, you want cannon-balls or bombs to strike nearer to\nyou.\n\nBut again the sentry has shouted in his loud, thick voice, "Mortar!"\nagain there is a shriek, and a bomb bursts, but with this noise comes\nthe groan of a man. You approach the wounded man, at the same moment\nwith the bearers; he has a strange, inhuman aspect, covered as he is\nwith blood and mud. A part of the sailor\'s breast has been torn away.\nDuring the first moments, there is visible on his mud-stained face\nonly fear and a certain simulated, premature expression of suffering,\npeculiar to men in that condition; but, at the same time, as the\nstretcher is brought to him and he is laid upon it on his sound side,\nyou observe that this expression is replaced by an expression of a\nsort of exaltation and lofty, inexpressible thought. His eyes shine\nmore brilliantly, his teeth are clenched, his head is held higher with\ndifficulty, and, as they lift him up, he stops the bearers and says\nto his comrades, with difficulty and in a trembling voice: "Farewell,\nbrothers!" He tries to say something more, and it is plain that he\nwants to say something touching, but he repeats once more: "Farewell,\nbrothers!"\n\nAt that moment, one of his fellow-sailors steps up to him, puts the cap\non the head which the wounded man holds towards him, and, waving his\nhand indifferently, returns calmly to his gun. "That\'s the way with\nseven or eight men every day," says the naval officer to you, in reply\nto the expression of horror which has appeared upon your countenance,\nas he yawns and rolls a cigarette of yellow paper.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThus you have seen the defenders of Sevastopol, on the very scene of\nthe defence, and you go back paying no attention, for some reason\nor other, to the cannon-balls and bullets, which continue to shriek\nthe whole way until you reach the ruined theatre,--you proceed with\ncomposure, and with your soul in a state of exaltation.\n\nThe principal and cheering conviction which you have brought away is\nthe conviction of the impossibility of the Russian people wavering\nanywhere whatever--and this impossibility you have discerned not in the\nmultitude of traverses, breastworks, artfully interlaced trenches,\nmines, and ordnance, piled one upon the other, of which you have\ncomprehended nothing; but you have discerned it in the eyes, the\nspeech, the manners, in what is called the spirit of the defenders\nof Sevastopol. What they are doing they do so simply, with so little\neffort and exertion, that you are convinced that they can do a hundred\ntimes more--that they can do anything. You understand that the feeling\nwhich makes them work is not a feeling of pettiness, ambition,\nforgetfulness, which you have yourself experienced, but a different\nsentiment, one more powerful, and one which has made of them men who\nlive with their ordinary composure under the fire of cannon, amid\nhundreds of chances of death, instead of the one to which all men are\nsubject who live under these conditions amid incessant labor, poverty,\nand dirt. Men will not accept these frightful conditions for the sake\nof a cross or a title, nor because of threats; there must be another\nlofty incentive as a cause, and this cause is the feeling which rarely\nappears, of which a Russian is ashamed, that which lies at the bottom\nof each man\'s soul--love for his country.\n\nOnly now have the tales of the early days of the siege of Sevastopol,\nwhen there were no fortifications there, no army, no physical\npossibility of holding it, and when at the same time there was not\nthe slightest doubt that it would not surrender to the enemy,--of the\ndays when that hero worthy of ancient Greece, Korniloff, said, as he\nreviewed the army: "We will die, children, but we will not surrender\nSevastopol;" and our Russians, who are not fitted to be phrase-makers,\nreplied: "We will die! hurrah!"--only now have tales of that time ceased\nto be for you the most beautiful historical legends, and have become\nreal facts and worthy of belief. You comprehend clearly, you figure\nto yourself, those men whom you have just seen, as the very heroes of\nthose grievous times, who have not fallen, but have been raised by the\nspirit, and have joyfully prepared for death, not for the sake of the\ncity, but of the country. This epos of Sevastopol, whose hero was the\nRussian people, will leave mighty traces in Russia for a long time to\ncome.\n\nNight is already falling. The sun has emerged from the gray clouds,\nwhich cover the sky just before its setting, and has suddenly\nilluminated with a crimson glow the purple vapors, the greenish sea\ncovered with ships and boats rocking on the regular swell, and the\nwhite buildings of the city, and the people who are moving through its\nstreets. Sounds of some old waltz played by the regimental band on the\nboulevard, and the sounds of firing from the bastions, which echo them\nstrangely, are borne across the water.\n\n\n\n\nSEVASTOPOL IN MAY, 1855.\n\n\nI.\n\nSix months have already passed since the first cannon-ball whistled\nfrom the bastions of Sevastopol, and ploughed the earth in the works\nof the enemy, and since that day thousands of bombs, cannon-balls, and\nrifle-balls have been flying incessantly from the bastions into the\ntrenches and from the trenches into the bastions, and the angel of\ndeath has never ceased to hover over them.\n\nThousands of men have been disappointed in satisfying their ambition;\nthousands have succeeded in satisfying theirs, in becoming swollen\nwith pride; thousands repose in the embrace of death. How many red\ncoffins and canvas canopies there have been! And still the same sounds\nare echoed from the bastions, and still on clear evenings the French\npeer from their camp, with involuntary tremor, at the yellow, furrowed\nbastions of Sevastopol, at the black forms of our sailors moving about\nupon them, and count the embrasures and the iron cannon which project\nangrily from them; the under officer still gazes through his telescope,\nfrom the heights of the telegraph station, at the dark figures of the\nFrench at their batteries, at their tents, at the columns moving over\nthe green hill, and at the puffs of smoke which issue forth from the\ntrenches,--and a crowd of men, formed of divers races, still streams in\nthrongs from various quarters, with the same ardor as ever, and with\ndesires differing even more greatly than their races, towards this\nfateful spot. And the question, unsolved by the diplomats, has still\nnot been solved by powder and blood.\n\n\nII.\n\nOn the boulevard of the besieged city of Sevastopol, not far from the\npavilion, the regimental band was playing, and throngs of military\nmen and of women moved gayly through the streets. The brilliant sun\nof spring had risen in the morning over the works of the English, had\npassed over the bastions, then over the city, over the Nikolaevsky\nbarracks, and, illuminating all with equal cheer, had now sunk into\nthe blue and distant sea, which was lighted with a silvery gleam as it\nheaved in peace.\n\nA tall, rather bent infantry officer, who was drawing upon his hand a\nglove which was presentable, if not entirely white, came out of one of\nthe small naval huts, built on the left side of the Morskaya[C] street,\nand, staring thoughtfully at the ground, took his way up the slope to\nthe boulevard.\n\n[C] Sea.\n\nThe expression of this officer\'s homely countenance did not indicate\nany great mental capacity, but rather simplicity, judgment, honor, and\na tendency to solid worth. He was badly built, not graceful, and he\nseemed to be constrained in his movements. He was dressed in a little\nworn cap, a cloak of a rather peculiar shade of lilac, from beneath\nwhose edge the gold of a watch-chain was visible; in trousers with\nstraps, and brilliantly polished calfskin boots. He must have been\neither a German--but his features clearly indicate his purely Russian\ndescent--or an adjutant, or a regimental quartermaster, only in that\ncase he would have had spurs, or an officer who had exchanged from the\ncavalry for the period of the campaign, or possibly from the Guards. He\nwas, in fact, an officer who had exchanged from the cavalry, and as he\nascended the boulevard, at the present moment, he was meditating upon a\nletter which he had just received from a former comrade, now a retired\nland-owner in the Government of T., and his wife, pale, blue-eyed\nNatasha, his great friend. He recalled one passage of the letter, in\nwhich his comrade said:--\n\n"When our _Invalid_[D] arrives, Pupka (this was the name by which the\nretired uhlan called his wife) rushes headlong into the vestibule,\nseizes the paper, and runs with it to the seat in the arbor, _in\nthe drawing-room_ (in which, if you remember, you and I passed such\ndelightful winter evenings when the regiment was stationed in our\ntown), and reads your heroic deeds with such ardor as it is impossible\nfor you to imagine. She often speaks of you. \'There is Mikhailoff,\' she\nsays, \'he\'s such a _love of a man_. I am ready to kiss him when I see\nhim. He fights on the bastions, and he will surely receive the Cross of\nSt. George, and he will be talked about in the newspapers ...\' and so\non, and so on ... so that I am really beginning to be jealous of you."\n\n[D] Military Gazette.\n\nIn another place he writes: "The papers reach us frightfully late,\nand, although there is plenty of news conveyed by word of mouth, not\nall of it can be trusted. For instance, the _young ladies with the\nmusic_, acquaintances of yours, were saying yesterday that Napoleon\nwas already captured by our Cossacks, and that he had been sent to\nPetersburg; but you will comprehend how much I believe of this.\nMoreover, a traveller from Petersburg told us (he has been sent on\nspecial business by the minister, is a very agreeable person, and, now\nthat there is no one in town, he is more of a _resource_ to us than\nyou can well imagine ...) well, he declares it to be a fact that our\ntroops have taken Eupatoria, _so that the French have no communication\nwhatever with Balaklava_, and that in this engagement two hundred of\nours were killed, but that the French lost fifteen thousand. My wife\nwas in such raptures over this that she _caroused_ all night, and she\ndeclares that her instinct tells her that you certainly took part in\nthat affair, and that you distinguished yourself."\n\nIn spite of these words, and of the expressions which I have purposely\nput in italics, and the whole tone of the letter, Staff-Captain\nMikhailoff recalled, with inexpressibly sad delight, his pale friend\nin the provinces, and how she had sat with him in the arbor in the\nevening, and talked about sentiment, and he thought of his good\ncomrade, the uhlan, and of how the latter had grown angry and had lost\nthe game when they had played cards for kopek stakes in his study, and\nhow the wife had laughed at them ... he recalled the friendship of\nthese two people for himself (perhaps it seemed to him to lie chiefly\non the side of his pale feminine friend); all these faces with their\nsurroundings flitted before his mind\'s eye, in a wonderfully sweet,\ncheerfully rosy light, and, smiling at his reminiscences, he placed his\nhand on the pocket which contained the letter so dear to him.\n\nFrom reminiscences Captain Mikhailoff involuntarily proceeded to dreams\nand hopes. "And what will be the joy and amazement of Natasha," he\nthought, as he paced along the narrow lane, "... when she suddenly\nreads in the _Invalid_ a description of how I was the first to climb\nupon the cannon, and that I have received the George! I shall certainly\nbe promoted to a full captaincy, by virtue of seniority. Then it is\nquite possible that I may get the grade of major in the line, this\nvery year, because many of our brothers have already been killed, and\nmany more will be in this campaign. And after that there will be more\naffairs on hand, and a regiment will be entrusted to me, since I am\nan experienced man ... lieutenant-colonel ... the Order of St. Anna\non my neck ... colonel!..." and he was already a general, granting an\ninterview to Natasha, the widow of his comrade, who, according to his\ndreams, would have died by that time, when the sounds of the music\non the boulevard penetrated more distinctly to his ears, the crowds\nof people caught his eye, and he found himself on the boulevard, a\nstaff-captain of infantry as before.\n\n\nIII.\n\nHe went, first of all, to the pavilion, near which were standing the\nmusicians, for whom other soldiers of the same regiment were holding\nthe notes, in the absence of stands, and about whom a ring of cadets,\nnurses, and children had formed, intent rather on seeing than on\nhearing. Around the pavilion stood, sat, or walked sailors, adjutants,\nand officers in white gloves. Along the grand avenue of the boulevard\npaced officers of every sort, and women of every description, rarely in\nbonnets, mostly with kerchiefs on their heads (some had neither bonnets\nnor kerchiefs), but no one was old, and it was worthy of note that all\nwere gay young creatures. Beyond, in the shady and fragrant alleys of\nwhite acacia, isolated groups walked and sat.\n\nNo one was especially delighted to encounter Captain Mikhailoff on\nthe boulevard, with the exception, possibly, of the captain of his\nregiment, Obzhogoff, and Captain Suslikoff, who pressed his hand\nwarmly; but the former was dressed in camel\'s-hair trousers, no\ngloves, a threadbare coat, and his face was very red and covered with\nperspiration, and the second shouted so loudly and incoherently that it\nwas mortifying to walk with them, particularly in the presence of the\nofficers in white gloves (with one of whom, an adjutant, Staff-Captain\nMikhailoff exchanged bows; and he might have bowed to another\nstaff-officer, since he had met him twice at the house of a mutual\nacquaintance). Besides, what pleasure was it to him to promenade with\nthese two gentlemen, Obzhogoff and Suslikoff, when he had met them and\nshaken hands with them six times that day already? It was not for this\nthat he had come.\n\nHe wanted to approach the adjutant with whom he had exchanged bows, and\nto enter into conversation with these officers, not for the sake of\nletting Captains Obzhogoff and Suslikoff and Lieutenant Pashtetzky see\nhim talking with them, but simply because they were agreeable people,\nand, what was more, they knew the news, and would have told it.\n\nBut why is Captain Mikhailoff afraid, and why cannot he make up his\nmind to approach them? "What if they should, all at once, refuse\nto recognize me," he thinks, "or, having bowed to me, what if they\ncontinue their conversation among themselves, as though I did not\nexist, or walk away from me entirely, and leave me standing there\nalone among the _aristocrats_." The word aristocrats (in the sense of\na higher, select circle, in any rank of life) has acquired for some\ntime past with us, in Russia, a great popularity, and has penetrated\ninto every locality and into every class of society whither vanity has\npenetrated--among merchants, among officials, writers, and officers, to\nSaratoff, to Mamaduish, to Vinnitz, everywhere where men exist.\n\nTo Captain Obzhogoff, Staff-Captain Mikhailoff was an _aristocrat_. To\nStaff-Captain Mikhailoff, Adjutant Kalugin was an _aristocrat_, because\nhe was an adjutant, and was on such a footing with the other adjutants\nas to call them "thou"! To Adjutant Kalugin, Count Nordoff was an\n_aristocrat_, because he was an adjutant on the Emperor\'s staff.\n\nVanity! vanity! and vanity everywhere, even on the brink of the grave,\nand among men ready to die for the highest convictions. Vanity! It\nmust be that it is a characteristic trait, and a peculiar malady of\nour century. Why was nothing ever heard among the men of former days,\nof this passion, any more than of the small-pox or the cholera? Why did\nHomer and Shakespeare talk of love, of glory, of suffering, while the\nliterature of our age is nothing but an endless narrative of snobs and\nvanity?\n\nThe staff-captain walked twice in indecision past the group of _his\naristocrats_, and the third time he exerted an effort over himself\nand went up to them. This group consisted of four officers: Adjutant\nKalugin, an acquaintance of Mikhailoff\'s, Adjutant Prince Galtsin,\nwho was something of an aristocrat even for Kalugin himself, Colonel\nNeferdoff, one of the so-called _hundred and twenty-two_ men of the\nworld (who had entered the service for this campaign, from the retired\nlist), and Captain of Cavalry Praskukhin, also one of the hundred and\ntwenty-two. Luckily for Mikhailoff, Kalugin was in a very fine humor\n(the general had just been talking to him in a very confidential way,\nand Prince Galtsin, who had just arrived from Petersburg, was stopping\nwith him); he did not consider it beneath his dignity to give his\nhand to Captain Mikhailoff, which Praskukhin, however, could not make\nup his mind to do, though he had met Mikhailoff very frequently on the\nbastion, had drunk the latter\'s wine and vodka, and was even indebted\nto him twenty rubles and a half at preference. As he did not yet know\nPrince Galtsin very well, he did not wish to convict himself, in the\nlatter\'s presence, of an acquaintance with a simple staff-captain of\ninfantry. He bowed slightly to the latter.\n\n"Well, Captain," said Kalugin, "when are we to go to the bastion again?\nDo you remember how we met each other on the Schvartz redoubt--it was\nhot there, hey?"\n\n"Yes, it was hot," said Mikhailoff, recalling how he had, that night,\nas he was making his way along the trenches to the bastion, encountered\nKalugin, who was walking along like a hero, valiantly clanking his\nsword. "I ought to have gone there to-morrow, according to present\narrangements; but we have a sick man," pursued Mikhailoff, "one\nofficer, as...."\n\nHe was about to relate how it was not his turn, but, as the commander\nof the eighth company was ill, and the company had only a cornet\nleft, he had regarded it as his duty to offer himself in the place\nof Lieutenant Nepshisetzky, and was, therefore, going to the bastion\nto-day. But Kalugin did not hear him out.\n\n"I have a feeling that something is going to happen within a few days,"\nhe said to Prince Galtsin.\n\n"And won\'t there be something to-day?" asked Mikhailoff, glancing first\nat Kalugin, then at Galtsin.\n\nNo one made him any reply. Prince Galtsin merely frowned a little, sent\nhis eyes past the other\'s cap, and, after maintaining silence for a\nmoment, said:--\n\n"That\'s a magnificent girl in the red kerchief. You don\'t know her, do\nyou, captain?"\n\n"She lives near my quarters; she is the daughter of a sailor," replied\nthe staff-captain.\n\n"Come on; let\'s have a good look at her."\n\nAnd Prince Galtsin linked one arm in that of Kalugin, the other in that\nof the staff-captain, being convinced in advance that he could afford\nthe latter no greater gratification, which was, in fact, quite true.\n\nThe staff-captain was superstitious, and considered it a great sin\nto occupy himself with women before a battle; but on this occasion he\nfeigned to be a vicious man, which Prince Galtsin and Kalugin evidently\ndid not believe, and which greatly amazed the girl in the red kerchief,\nwho had more than once observed how the staff-captain blushed as he\npassed her little window. Praskukhin walked behind, and kept touching\nPrince Galtsin with his hand, and making various remarks in the French\ntongue; but as a fourth person could not walk on the small path, he\nwas obliged to walk alone, and it was only on the second round that he\ntook the arm of the brave and well known naval officer _Servyagin_,\nwho had stepped up and spoken to him, and who was also desirous of\njoining the circle of _aristocrats_. And the gallant and famous beau\njoyfully thrust his honest and muscular hand through the elbow of a\nman who was known to all, and even well known to Servyagin, as not\ntoo nice. When Praskukhin, explaining to the prince his acquaintance\nwith _that sailor_, whispered to him that the latter was well known\nfor his bravery, Prince Galtsin, having been on the fourth bastion on\nthe previous evening, having seen a bomb burst twenty paces from him,\nconsidering himself no less a hero than this gentleman, and thinking\nthat many a reputation is acquired undeservedly, paid no particular\nattention to Servyagin.\n\nIt was so agreeable to Staff-Captain Mikhailoff to walk about in this\ncompany that he forgot the _dear_ letter from T----, and the gloomy\nthoughts which had assailed him in connection with his impending\ndeparture for the bastion. He remained with them until they began\nto talk exclusively among themselves, avoiding his glances, thereby\ngiving him to understand that he might go, and finally deserted him\nentirely. But the staff-captain was content, nevertheless, and as he\npassed Yunker[E] Baron Pesth, who had been particularly haughty and\nself-conceited since the preceding night, which was the first that he\nhad spent in the bomb-proof of the fifth bastion, and consequently\nconsidered himself a hero, he was not in the least offended at the\npresumptuous expression with which the yunker straightened himself up\nand doffed his hat before him.\n\n[E] A civilian, without military training, attached to a regiment as a\nnon-commissioned officer, who may eventually become a regular officer.\n\n\nIV.\n\nWhen later the staff-captain crossed the threshold of his quarters,\nentirely different thoughts entered his mind. He looked around his\nlittle chamber, with its uneven earth floor, and saw the windows all\nawry, pasted over with paper, his old bed, with a rug nailed over\nit, upon which was depicted a lady on horseback, and over which hung\ntwo Tula pistols, the dirty couch of a cadet who lived with him, and\nwhich was covered with a chintz coverlet; he saw his Nikita, who, with\nuntidy, tallowed hair, rose from the floor, scratching his head; he saw\nhis ancient cloak, his extra pair of boots, and a little bundle, from\nwhich peeped a bit of cheese and the neck of a porter bottle filled\nwith vodka, which had been prepared for his use on the bastion, and all\nat once he remembered that he was obliged to go with his company that\nnight to the fortifications.\n\n"It is certainly foreordained that I am to be killed to-night," thought\nthe captain.... "I feel it. And the principal point is that I need not\nhave gone, but that I offered myself. And the man who thrusts himself\nforward is always killed. And what\'s the matter with that accursed\nNepshisetsky? It is quite possible that he is not sick at all; and they\nwill kill another man for his sake, they will infallibly kill him.\nHowever, if they don\'t kill me, I shall be promoted probably. I saw how\ndelighted the regimental commander was when I asked him to allow me to\ngo, if Lieutenant Nepshisetsky was ill. If I don\'t turn out a major,\nthen I shall certainly get the Vladimir cross. This is the thirteenth\ntime that I have been to the bastion. Ah, the thirteenth is an unlucky\nnumber. They will surely kill me, I feel that I shall be killed; but\nsome one had to go, it was impossible for the lieutenant of the corps\nto go. And, whatever happens, the honor of the regiment, the honor of\nthe army, depends on it. It was my _duty_ to go ... yes, my sacred\nduty. But I have a foreboding."\n\nThe captain forgot that this was not the first time that a similar\nforeboding had assailed him, in a greater or less degree, when it had\nbeen necessary to go to the bastion, and he did not know that every\none who sets out on an affair experiences this foreboding with more or\nless force. Having calmed himself with this conception of duty, which\nwas especially and strongly developed in the staff-captain, he seated\nhimself at the table, and began to write a farewell letter to his\nfather. Ten minutes later, having finished his letter, he rose from the\ntable, his eyes wet with tears, and, mentally reciting all the prayers\nhe knew, he set about dressing. His coarse, drunken servant indolently\nhanded him his new coat (the old one, which the captain generally wore\nwhen going to the bastion, was not mended).\n\n"Why is not my coat mended? You never do anything but sleep, you\ngood-for-nothing!" said Mikhailoff, angrily.\n\n"Sleep!" grumbled Nikita. "You run like a dog all day long; perhaps you\nstop--but you must not sleep, even then!"\n\n"You are drunk again, I see."\n\n"I didn\'t get drunk on your money, so you needn\'t scold."\n\n"Hold your tongue, blockhead!" shouted the captain, who was ready to\nstrike the man. He had been absent-minded at first, but now he was, at\nlast, out of patience, and embittered by the rudeness of Nikita, whom\nhe loved, even spoiled, and who had lived with him for twelve years.\n\n"Blockhead? Blockhead?" repeated the servant. "Why do you call me a\nblockhead, sir? Is this a time for that sort of thing? It is not good\nto curse."\n\nMikhailoff recalled whither he was on the point of going, and felt\nashamed of himself.\n\n"You are enough to put a saint out of patience, Nikita," he said, in a\ngentle voice. "Leave that letter to my father on the table, and don\'t\ntouch it," he added, turning red.\n\n"Yes, sir," said Nikita, melting under the influence of the wine which\nhe had drunk, as he had said, "at his own expense," and winking his\neyes with a visible desire to weep.\n\nBut when the captain said: "Good-by, Nikita," on the porch, Nikita\nsuddenly broke down into repressed sobs, and ran to kiss his master\'s\nhand.... "Farewell, master!" he exclaimed, sobbing. The old sailor\'s\nwife, who was standing on the porch, could not, in her capacity of a\nwoman, refrain from joining in this touching scene, so she began to\nwipe her eyes with her dirty sleeve, and to say something about even\ngentlemen having their trials to bear, and that she, poor creature, had\nbeen left a widow. And she related for the hundredth time to drunken\nNikita the story of her woes; how her husband had been killed in the\nfirst bombardment, and how her little house had been utterly ruined\n(the one in which she was now living did not belong to her), and so on.\nWhen his master had departed, Nikita lighted his pipe, requested the\ndaughter of their landlord to go for some vodka, and very soon ceased\nto weep, but, on the contrary, got into a quarrel with the old woman\nabout some small bucket, which, he declared, she had broken.\n\n"But perhaps I shall only be wounded," meditated the captain, as he\nmarched through the twilight to the bastion with his company. "But\nwhere? How? Here or here?" he thought, indicating his belly and his\nbreast.... "If it should be here (he thought of the upper portion of\nhis leg), it might run round. Well, but if it were here, and by a\nsplinter, that would finish me."\n\nThe captain reached the fortifications safely through the trenches,\nset his men to work, with the assistance of an officer of sappers, in\nthe darkness, which was complete, and seated himself in a pit behind\nthe breastworks. There was not much firing; only once in a while\nthe lightning flashed from our batteries, then from _his_, and the\nbrilliant fuse of a bomb traced an arc of flame against the dark,\nstarry heavens. But all the bombs fell far in the rear and to the right\nof the rifle-pits in which the captain sat. He drank his vodka, ate his\ncheese, lit his cigarette, and, after saying his prayers, he tried to\nget a little sleep.\n\n\nV.\n\nPrince Galtsin, Lieutenant-Colonel Neferdoff, and Praskukhin, whom no\none had invited, to whom no one spoke, but who never left them, all\nwent to drink tea with Adjutant Kalugin.\n\n"Well, you did not finish telling me about Vaska Mendel," said\nKalugin, as he took off his cloak, seated himself by the window in a\nsoft lounging-chair, and unbuttoned the collar of his fresh, stiffly\nstarched cambric shirt: "How did he come to marry?"\n\n"That\'s a joke, my dear fellow! There was a time, I assure you, when\nnothing else was talked of in Petersburg," said Prince Galtsin, with a\nlaugh, as he sprang up from the piano, and seated himself on the window\nbeside Kalugin. "It is simply ludicrous, and I know all the details of\nthe affair."\n\nAnd he began to relate--in a merry, and skilful manner--a love story,\nwhich we will omit, because it possesses no interest for us. But it\nis worthy of note that not only Prince Galtsin, but all the gentlemen\nwho had placed themselves here, one on the window-sill, another with\nhis legs coiled up under him, a third at the piano, seemed totally\ndifferent persons from what they were when on the boulevard; there was\nnothing of that absurd arrogance and haughtiness which they and their\nkind exhibit in public to the infantry officers; here they were among\ntheir own set and natural, especially Kalugin and Prince Galtsin, and\nwere like very good, amiable, and merry children. The conversation\nturned on their companions in the service in Petersburg, and on their\nacquaintances.\n\n"What of Maslovsky?"\n\n"Which? the uhlan of the body-guard or of the horse-guard?"\n\n"I know both of them. The one in the horse-guards was with me when he\nwas a little boy, and had only just left school. What is the elder one?\na captain of cavalry?"\n\n"Oh, yes! long ago."\n\n"And is he still going about with his gypsy maid?"\n\n"No, he has deserted her ..." and so forth, and so forth, in the same\nstrain.\n\nThen Prince Galtsin seated himself at the piano, and sang a gypsy song\nin magnificent style. Praskukhin began to sing second, although no\none had asked him, and he did it so well that they requested him to\naccompany the prince again, which he gladly consented to do.\n\nThe servant came in with the tea, cream, and cracknels on a silver\nsalver.\n\n"Serve the prince," said Kalugin.\n\n"Really, it is strange to think," said Galtsin, taking a glass, and\nwalking to the window, "that we are in a beleaguered city; tea with\ncream, and such quarters as I should be only too happy to get in\nPetersburg."\n\n"Yes, if it were not for that," said the old lieutenant-colonel, who\nwas dissatisfied with everything, "this constant waiting for something\nwould be simply unendurable ... and to see how men are killed, killed\nevery day,--and there is no end to it, and under such circumstances it\nwould not be comfortable to live in the mud."\n\n"And how about our infantry officers?" said Kalugin. "They live in the\nbastions with the soldiers in the casemates and eat beet soup with the\nsoldiers--how about them?"\n\n"How about them? They don\'t change their linen for ten days at a time,\nand they are heroes--wonderful men."\n\nAt this moment an officer of infantry entered the room.\n\n"I ... I was ordered ... may I present myself to the gen ... to His\nExcellency from General N.?" he inquired, bowing with an air of\nembarrassment.\n\nKalugin rose, but, without returning the officer\'s salute, he asked\nhim, with insulting courtesy and strained official smile, whether\n_they_[F] would not wait awhile; and, without inviting him to be seated\nor paying any further attention to him, he turned to Prince Galtsin\nand began to speak to him in French, so that the unhappy officer, who\nremained standing in the middle of the room, absolutely did not know\nwhat to do with himself.\n\n[F] A polite way of referring to the general in the plural.\n\n"It is on very important business, sir," said the officer, after a\nmomentary pause.\n\n"Ah! very well, then," said Kalugin, putting on his cloak, and\naccompanying him to the door.\n\n"_Eh bien, messieurs_, I think there will be hot work to-night," said\nKalugin in French, on his return from the general\'s.\n\n"Hey? What? A sortie?" They all began to question him.\n\n"I don\'t know yet--you will see for yourselves," replied Kalugin, with a\nmysterious smile.\n\n"And my commander is on the bastion--of course, I shall have to go,"\nsaid Praskukhin, buckling on his sword.\n\nBut no one answered him: he must know for himself whether he had to go\nor not.\n\nPraskukhin and Neferdoff went off, in order to betake themselves to\ntheir posts. "Farewell, gentlemen!" "Au revoir, gentlemen! We shall\nmeet again to-night!" shouted Kalugin from the window when Praskukhin\nand Neferdoff trotted down the street, bending over the bows of their\nCossack saddles. The trampling of their Cossack horses soon died away\nin the dusky street.\n\n"No, tell me, is something really going to take place to-night?" said\nGaltsin, in French, as he leaned with Kalugin on the window-sill, and\ngazed at the bombs which were flying over the bastions.\n\n"I can tell you, you see ... you have been on the bastions, of course?"\n(Galtsin made a sign of assent, although he had been only once to the\nfourth bastion.) "Well, there was a trench opposite our lunette",\nand Kalugin, who was not a specialist, although he considered his\njudgment on military affairs particularly accurate, began to explain\nthe position of our troops and of the enemy\'s works and the plan of the\nproposed affair, mixing up the technical terms of fortifications a good\ndeal in the process.\n\n"But they are beginning to hammer away at our casemates. Oho! was that\nours or _his_? there, it has burst," they said, as they leaned on the\nwindow-sill, gazing at the fiery line of the bomb, which exploded in\nthe air, at the lightning of the discharges, at the dark blue sky,\nmomentarily illuminated, and at the white smoke of the powder, and\nlistened to the sounds of the firing, which grew louder and louder.\n\n"What a charming sight? is it not?" said Kalugin, in French, directing\nthe attention of his guest to the really beautiful spectacle. "Do you\nknow, you cannot distinguish the stars from the bombs at times."\n\n"Yes, I was just thinking that that was a star; but it darted down ...\nthere, it has burst now. And that big star yonder, what is it called?\nIt is just exactly like a bomb."\n\n"Do you know, I have grown so used to these bombs that I am convinced\nthat a starlight night in Russia will always seem to me to be all\nbombs; one gets so accustomed to them."\n\n"But am not I to go on this sortie?" inquired Galtsin, after a\nmomentary silence.\n\n"Enough of that, brother! Don\'t think of such a thing! I won\'t let you\ngo!" replied Kalugin. "Your turn will come, brother!"\n\n"Seriously? So you think that it is not necessary to go? Hey?..."\n\nAt that moment, a frightful crash of rifles was heard in the direction\nin which these gentlemen were looking, above the roar of the cannon,\nand thousands of small fires, flaring up incessantly, without\nintermission, flashed along the entire line.\n\n"That\'s it, when the real work has begun!" said Kalugin.--"That is the\nsound of the rifles, and I cannot hear it in cold blood; it takes a\nsort of hold on your soul, you know. And there is the hurrah!" he\nadded, listening to the prolonged and distant roar of hundreds of\nvoices, "A-a-aa!" which reached him from the bastion.\n\n"What is this hurrah, theirs or ours?"\n\n"I don\'t know; but it has come to a hand-to-hand fight, for the firing\nhas ceased."\n\nAt that moment, an officer followed by his Cossack galloped up to the\nporch, and slipped down from his horse.\n\n"Where from?"\n\n"From the bastion. The general is wanted."\n\n"Let us go. Well, now, what is it?"\n\n"They have attacked the lodgements ... have taken them ... the French\nhave brought up their heavy reserves ... they have attacked our forces\n... there were only two battalions," said the panting officer, who\nwas the same that had come in the evening, drawing his breath with\ndifficulty, but stepping to the door with perfect unconcern.\n\n"Well, have they retreated?" inquired Galtsin.\n\n"No," answered the officer, angrily. "The battalion came up and beat\nthem back; but the commander of the regiment is killed, and many\nofficers, and I have been ordered to ask for re-enforcements...."\n\nAnd with these words he and Kalugin went off to the general, whither we\nwill not follow them.\n\nFive minutes later, Kalugin was mounted on the Cossack\'s horse (and\nwith that peculiar, _quasi_-Cossack seat, in which, as I have observed,\nall adjutants find something especially captivating, for some reason\nor other), and rode at a trot to the bastion, in order to give some\norders, and to await the news of the final result of the affair. And\nPrince Galtsin, under the influence of that oppressive emotion which\nthe signs of a battle near at hand usually produce on a spectator who\ntakes no part in it, went out into the street, and began to pace up and\ndown there without any object.\n\n\nVI.\n\nThe soldiers were bearing the wounded on stretchers, and supporting\nthem by their arms. It was completely dark in the streets; now and\nthen, a rare light flashed in the hospital or from the spot where\nthe officers were seated. The same thunder of cannon and exchange of\nrifle-shots was borne from the bastions, and the same fires flashed\nagainst the dark heavens. Now and then, you could hear the trampling\nhoofs of an orderly\'s horse, the groan of a wounded man, the footsteps\nand voices of the stretcher-bearers, or the conversation of some of the\nfrightened female inhabitants, who had come out on their porches to\nview the cannonade.\n\nAmong the latter were our acquaintances Nikita, the old sailor\'s widow,\nwith whom he had already made his peace, and her ten-year-old daughter.\n"Lord, Most Holy Mother of God!" whispered the old woman to herself\nwith a sigh, as she watched the bombs, which, like balls of fire,\nsailed incessantly from one side to the other. "What a shame, what a\nshame! I-i-hi-hi! It was not so in the first bombardment. See, there it\nhas burst, the cursed thing! right above our house in the suburbs."\n\n"No, it is farther off, in aunt Arinka\'s garden, that they all fall,"\nsaid the little girl.\n\n"And where, where is my master now!" said Nikita, with a drawl, for he\nwas still rather drunk. "Oh, how I love that master of mine!--I don\'t\nknow myself!--I love him so that if, which God forbid, they should\nkill him in this sinful fight, then, if you will believe it, aunty, I\ndon\'t know myself what I might do to myself in that case--by Heavens, I\ndon\'t! He is such a master that words will not do him justice! Would\nI exchange him for one of those who play cards? That is simply--whew!\nthat\'s all there is to say!" concluded Nikita, pointing at the lighted\nwindow of his master\'s room, in which, as the staff-captain was\nabsent, Yunker Zhvadchevsky had invited his friends to a carouse, on\nthe occasion of his receiving the cross: Sub-Lieutenant Ugrovitch and\nSub-Lieutenant Nepshisetsky, who was ill with a cold in the head.\n\n"Those little stars! They dart through the sky like stars, like stars!"\nsaid the little girl, breaking the silence which succeeded Nikita\'s\nwords. "There, there! another has dropped! Why do they do it, mamma?"\n\n"They will ruin our little cabin entirely," said the old woman,\nsighing, and not replying to her little daughter\'s question.\n\n"And when uncle and I went there to-day, mamma," continued the little\ngirl, in a shrill voice, "there was such a big cannon-ball lying in the\nroom, near the cupboard; it had broken through the wall and into the\nroom ... and it is so big that you couldn\'t lift it."\n\n"Those who had husbands and money have gone away," said the old woman,\n"and now they have ruined my last little house. See, see how they are\nfiring, the wretches. Lord, Lord!"\n\n"And as soon as we came out, a bomb flew at us, and burst and scattered\nthe earth about, and a piece of the shell came near striking uncle and\nme."\n\n\nVII.\n\nPrince Galtsin met more and more wounded men, in stretchers and on\nfoot, supporting each other, and talking loudly.\n\n"When they rushed up, brothers," said one tall soldier, who had two\nguns on his shoulder, in a bass voice, "when they rushed up and\nshouted, \'Allah, Allah!\'[G] they pressed each other on. You kill one,\nand another takes his place--you can do nothing. You never saw such\nnumbers as there were of them...."\n\n[G] A The Russian soldiers, who had been fighting the Turks, were so\naccustomed to this cry of the enemy that they always declared that the\nFrench also cried "Allah."--AUTHOR\'S NOTE.\n\nBut at this point in his story Galtsin interrupted him.\n\n"You come from the bastion?"\n\n"Just so, Your Honor!"\n\n"Well, what has been going on there? Tell me."\n\n"Why, what has been going on? They attacked in force, Your Honor;\nthey climbed over the wall, and that\'s the end of it. They conquered\ncompletely, Your Honor."\n\n"How conquered? You repulsed them, surely?"\n\n"How could we repulse them, when he came up with his whole force? They\nkilled all our men, and there was no help given us."\n\nThe soldier was mistaken, for the trenches were behind our forces; but\nthis is a peculiar thing, which any one may observe: a soldier who has\nbeen wounded in an engagement always thinks that the day has been lost,\nand that the encounter has been a frightfully bloody one.\n\n"Then, what did they mean by telling me that you had repulsed them?"\nsaid Galtsin, with irritation. "Perhaps the enemy was repulsed after\nyou left? Is it long since you came away?"\n\n"I have this instant come from there, Your Honor," replied the soldier.\n"It is hardly possible. The trenches remained in his hands ... he won a\ncomplete victory."\n\n"Well, and are you not ashamed to have surrendered the trenches? This\nis horrible!" said Galtsin, angered by such indifference.\n\n"What, when he was there in force?" growled the soldier.\n\n"And, Your Honor," said a soldier on a stretcher, who had just come up\nwith them, "how could we help surrendering, when nearly all of us had\nbeen killed? If we had been in force, we would only have surrendered\nwith our lives. But what was there to do? I ran one man through, and\nthen I was struck.... O-oh! softly, brothers! steady, brothers! go more\nsteadily!... O-oh!" groaned the wounded man.\n\n"There really seem to be a great many extra men coming this way," said\nGaltsin, again stopping the tall soldier with the two rifles. "Why are\nyou walking off? Hey there, halt!"\n\nThe soldier halted, and removed his cap with his left hand.\n\n"Where are you going, and why?" he shouted at him sternly. "He ..."\n\nBut, approaching the soldier very closely at that moment, he perceived\nthat the latter\'s right arm was bandaged, and covered with blood far\nabove the elbow.\n\n"I am wounded, Your Honor!"\n\n"Wounded? how?"\n\n"It must have been a bullet, here!" said the soldier, pointing at his\narm, "but I cannot tell yet. My head has been broken by something,"\nand, bending over, he showed the hair upon the back of it all clotted\ntogether with blood.\n\n"And whose gun is that second one you have?"\n\n"A choice French one, Your Honor! I captured it. And I should not have\ncome away if it had not been to accompany this soldier; he might fall\ndown," he added, pointing at the soldier, who was walking a little in\nfront, leaning upon his gun, and dragging his left foot heavily after\nhim.\n\nPrince Galtsin all at once became frightfully ashamed of his unjust\nsuspicions. He felt that he was growing crimson, and turned away,\nwithout questioning the wounded men further, and, without looking after\nthem, he went to the place where the injured men were being cared for.\n\nHaving forced his way with difficulty to the porch, through the wounded\nmen who had come on foot, and the stretcher-bearers, who were entering\nwith the wounded and emerging with the dead, Galtsin entered the first\nroom, glanced round, and involuntarily turned back, and immediately ran\ninto the street. It was too terrible.\n\n\nVIII.\n\nThe vast, dark, lofty hall, lighted only by the four or five candles,\nwhich the doctors were carrying about to inspect the wounded, was\nliterally full. The stretcher-bearers brought in the wounded, ranged\nthem one beside another on the floor, which was already so crowded that\nthe unfortunate wretches hustled each other and sprinkled each other\nwith their blood, and then went forth for more. The pools of blood\nwhich were visible on the unoccupied places, the hot breaths of several\nhundred men, and the steam which rose from those who were toiling\nwith the stretchers produced a peculiar, thick, heavy, offensive\natmosphere, in which the candles burned dimly in the different parts\nof the room. The dull murmur of diverse groans, sighs, death-rattles,\nbroken now and again by a shriek, was borne throughout the apartment.\nSisters of charity, with tranquil faces, and with an expression not of\nempty, feminine, tearfully sickly compassion, but of active, practical\nsympathy, flitted hither and thither among the blood-stained cloaks and\nshirts, stepping over the wounded, with medicine, water, bandages, lint.\n\nDoctors, with their sleeves rolled up, knelt beside the wounded, beside\nwhom the assistant surgeons held the candles, inspecting, feeling, and\nprobing the wounds, in spite of the terrible groans and entreaties of\nthe sufferers. One of the doctors was seated at a small table by the\ndoor, and, at the moment when Galtsin entered the room, he was just\nwriting down "No. 532."\n\n"Ivan Bogaeff, common soldier, third company of the S---- regiment,\n_fractura femoris complicata_!" called another from the extremity of\nthe hall, as he felt of the crushed leg.... "Turn him over."\n\n"O-oi, my fathers, good fathers!" shrieked the soldier, beseeching them\nnot to touch him.\n\n"_Perforatio capitis._"\n\n"Semyon Neferdoff, lieutenant-colonel of the N---- regiment of infantry.\nHave a little patience, colonel: you can only be attended to this way;\nI will let you alone," said a third, picking away at the head of the\nunfortunate colonel, with some sort of a hook.\n\n"Ai! stop! Oi! for God\'s sake, quick, quick, for the sake a-a-a-a!..."\n\n"_Perforatio pectoris_ ... Sevastyan Sereda, common soldier ... of what\nregiment? however, you need not write that: _moritur_. Carry him away,"\nsaid the doctor, abandoning the soldier, who was rolling his eyes, and\nalready emitting the death-rattle.\n\nForty stretcher-bearers stood at the door, awaiting the task of\ntransporting to the hospital the men who had been attended to, and the\ndead to the chapel, and gazed at this picture in silence, only uttering\na heavy sigh from time to time....\n\n\nIX.\n\nOn his way to the bastion, Kalugin met numerous wounded men; but,\nknowing from experience that such a spectacle has a bad effect on the\nspirits of a man on the verge of an action, he not only did not pause\nto interrogate them, but, on the contrary, he tried not to pay any heed\nto them. At the foot of the hill he encountered an orderly, who was\ngalloping from the bastion at full speed.\n\n"Zobkin! Zobkin! Stop a minute!"\n\n"Well, what is it?"\n\n"Where are you from?"\n\n"From the lodgements."\n\n"Well, how are things there! Hot?"\n\n"Ah, frightfully!"\n\nAnd the orderly galloped on.\n\nIn fact, although there was not much firing from the rifles, the\ncannonade had begun with fresh vigor and greater heat than ever.\n\n"Ah, that\'s bad!" thought Kalugin, experiencing a rather unpleasant\nsensation, and there came to him also a presentiment, that is to say, a\nvery usual thought--the thought of death.\n\nBut Kalugin was an egotist and gifted with nerves of steel; in a word,\nhe was what is called brave. He did not yield to his first sensation,\nand began to arouse his courage; he recalled to mind a certain adjutant\nof Napoleon, who, after having given the command to advance, galloped\nup to Napoleon, his head all covered with blood.\n\n"You are wounded?" said Napoleon to him. "I beg your pardon, Sire, I am\ndead,"--and the adjutant fell from his horse, and died on the spot.\n\nThis seemed very fine to him, and he fancied that he somewhat resembled\nthis adjutant; then he gave his horse a blow with the whip; and assumed\nstill more of that knowing Cossack bearing, glanced at his orderly, who\nwas galloping behind him, standing upright in his stirrups, and thus in\ndashing style he reached the place where it was necessary to dismount.\nHere he found four soldiers, who were smoking their pipes as they sat\non the stones.\n\n"What are you doing here?" he shouted at them.\n\n"We have been carrying a wounded man from the field, Your Honor, and\nhave sat down to rest," one of them replied, concealing his pipe behind\nhis back, and pulling off his cap.\n\n"Resting indeed! March off to your posts!"\n\nAnd, in company with them, he walked up the hill through the trenches,\nencountering wounded men at every step.\n\nOn attaining the crest of the hill, he turned to the left, and, after\ntaking a few steps, found himself quite alone. Splinters whizzed near\nhim, and struck in the trenches. Another bomb rose in front of him, and\nseemed to be flying straight at him. All of a sudden he felt terrified;\nhe ran off five paces at full speed, and lay down on the ground. But\nwhen the bomb burst, and at a distance from him, he grew dreadfully\nvexed at himself, and glanced about as he rose, to see whether any one\nhad perceived him fall, but there was no one about.\n\nWhen fear has once made its way into the mind, it does not speedily\ngive way to another feeling. He, who had boasted that he would\nnever bend, hastened along the trench with accelerated speed, and\nalmost on his hands and knees. "Ah! this is very bad!" he thought,\nas he stumbled. "I shall certainly be killed!" And, conscious of how\ndifficult it was for him to breathe, and that the perspiration was\nbreaking out all over his body, he was amazed at himself, but he no\nlonger strove to conquer his feelings.\n\nAll at once steps became audible in advance of him. He quickly\nstraightened himself up, raised his head, and, boldly clanking his\nsword, began to proceed at a slower pace than before. He did not know\nhimself. When he joined the officer of sappers and the sailor who\nwere coming to meet him, and the former called to him, "Lie down,"\npointing to the bright speck of a bomb, which, growing ever brighter\nand brighter, swifter and swifter, as it approached, crashed down\nin the vicinity of the trench, he only bent his head a very little,\ninvoluntarily, under the influence of the terrified shout, and went his\nway.\n\n"Whew! what a brave man!" ejaculated the sailor, who had calmly watched\nthe exploding bomb, and, with practised glance, at once calculated\nthat its splinters could not strike inside the trench; "he did not even\nwish to lie down."\n\nOnly a few steps remained to be taken, across an open space, before\nKalugin would reach the casemate of the commander of the bastion, when\nhe was again attacked by dimness of vision and that stupid sensation of\nfear; his heart began to beat more violently, the blood rushed to his\nhead, and he was obliged to exert an effort over himself in order to\nreach the casemate.\n\n"Why are you so out of breath?" inquired the general, when Kalugin had\ncommunicated to him his orders.\n\n"I have been walking very fast, Your Excellency!"\n\n"Will you not take a glass of wine?"\n\nKalugin drank the wine, and lighted a cigarette. The engagement had\nalready come to an end; only the heavy cannonade continued, going on\nfrom both sides.\n\nIn the casemate sat General N., the commander of the bastion, and six\nother officers, among whom was Praskukhin, discussing various details\nof the conflict. Seated in this comfortable apartment, with blue\nhangings, with a sofa, a bed, a table, covered with papers, a wall\nclock, and the holy pictures, before which burned a lamp, and gazing\nupon these signs of habitation, and at the arshin-thick (twenty-eight\ninches) beams which formed the ceiling, and listening to the shots,\nwhich were deadened by the casemate, Kalugin positively could not\nunderstand how he had twice permitted himself to be overcome with such\nunpardonable weakness. He was angry with himself, and he longed for\ndanger, in order that he might subject himself to another trial.\n\n"I am glad that you are here, captain," he said to a naval officer,\nin the cloak of staff-officer, with a large moustache and the cross\nof St. George, who entered the casemate at that moment, and asked the\ngeneral to give him some men, that he might repair the two embrasures\non his battery, which had been demolished. "The general ordered me to\ninquire," continued Kalugin, when the commander of the battery ceased\nto address the general, "whether your guns can fire grape-shot into\nthe trenches."\n\n"Only one of my guns will do that," replied the captain, gruffly.\n\n"Let us go and see, all the same."\n\nThe captain frowned, and grunted angrily:--\n\n"I have already passed the whole night there, and I came here to try\nand get a little rest," said he. "Cannot you go alone? My assistant,\nLieutenant Kartz, is there, and he will show you everything."\n\nThe captain had now been for six months in command of this, one of the\nmost dangerous of the batteries--and even when there were no casemates\nhe had lived, without relief, in the bastion and among the sailors,\nfrom the beginning of the siege, and he bore a reputation among them\nfor bravery. Therefore his refusal particularly struck and amazed\nKalugin. "That\'s what reputation is worth!" he thought.\n\n"Well, then, I will go alone, if you will permit it," he said, in a\nsomewhat bantering tone to the captain, who, however, paid not the\nslightest heed to his words.\n\nBut Kalugin did not reflect that he had passed, in all, at different\ntimes, perhaps fifty hours on the bastion, while the captain had lived\nthere for six months. Kalugin was actuated, moreover, by vanity, by\na desire to shine, by the hope of reward, of reputation, and by the\ncharm of risk; but the captain had already gone through all that: he\nhad been vain at first, he had displayed valor, he had risked his\nlife, he had hoped for fame and guerdon, and had even obtained them,\nbut these actuating motives had already lost their power over him, and\nhe regarded the matter in another light; he fulfilled his duty with\npunctuality, but understanding quite well how small were the chances\nfor his life which were left him, after a six-months residence in the\nbastion, he no longer risked these casualties, except in case of stern\nnecessity, so that the young lieutenant, who had entered the battery\nonly a week previous, and who was now showing it to Kalugin, in company\nwith whom he took turns in leaning out of the embrasure, or climbing\nout on the ramparts, seemed ten times as brave as the captain.\n\nAfter inspecting the battery, Kalugin returned to the casemate, and ran\nagainst the general in the dark, as the latter was ascending to the\nwatch-tower with his staff-officers.\n\n"Captain Praskukhin!" said the general, "please to go to the first\nlodgement and say to the second battery of the M---- regiment, which is\nat work there, that they are to abandon their work, to evacuate the\nplace without making any noise, and to join their regiment, which is\nstanding at the foot of the hill in reserve.... Do you understand? Lead\nthem to their regiment yourself."\n\n"Yes, sir."\n\nAnd Praskukhin set out for the lodgement on a run.\n\nThe firing was growing more infrequent.\n\n\nX.\n\n"Is this the second battalion of the M---- regiment?" asked Praskukhin,\nhastening up to the spot, and running against the soldiers who were\ncarrying earth in sacks.\n\n"Exactly so."\n\n"Where is the commander?"\n\nMikhailoff, supposing that the inquiry was for the commander of the\ncorps, crawled out of his pit, and, taking Praskukhin for the colonel,\nhe stepped up to him with his hand at his visor.\n\n"The general has given orders ... that you ... are to be so good as to\ngo ... as quickly as possible ... and, in particular, as quietly as\npossible, to the rear ... not to the rear exactly, but to the reserve,"\nsaid Praskukhin, glancing askance at the enemy\'s fires.\n\nOn recognizing Praskukhin and discovering the state of things,\nMikhailoff dropped his hand, gave his orders, and the battalion started\ninto motion, gathered up their guns, put on their cloaks, and set out.\n\nNo one who has not experienced it can imagine the delight which a man\nfeels when he takes his departure, after a three-hours bombardment,\nfrom such a dangerous post as the lodgements. Several times in the\ncourse of those three hours, Mikhailoff had, not without reason,\nconsidered his _end_ as inevitable, and had grown accustomed to the\nconviction that he should infallibly be killed, and that he no longer\nbelonged to this world. In spite of this, however, he had great\ndifficulty in keeping his feet from running away with him when he\nissued from the lodgements at the head of his corps, in company with\nPraskukhin.\n\n"Au revoir," said the major, the commander of another battalion, who\nwas to remain in the lodgements, and with whom he had shared his\ncheese, as they sat in the pit behind the breastworks--"a pleasant\njourney to you."\n\n"Thanks, I hope you will have good luck after we have gone. The firing\nseems to be holding up."\n\nBut no sooner had he said this than the enemy, who must have observed\nthe movement in the lodgements, began to fire faster and faster. Our\nguns began to reply to him, and again a heavy cannonade began. The\nstars were gleaming high, but not brilliantly in the sky. The night was\ndark--you could hardly see your hand before you; only the flashes of\nthe discharges and the explosions of the bombs illuminated objects for\na moment. The soldiers marched on rapidly, in silence, involuntarily\ntreading close on each other\'s heels; all that was audible through the\nincessant firing was the measured sound of their footsteps on the dry\nroad, the noise of their bayonets as they came in contact, or the sigh\nand prayer of some young soldier, "Lord, Lord! what is this!" Now and\nthen the groan of a wounded man arose, and the shout, "Stretcher!"\n(In the company commanded by Mikhailoff, twenty-six men were killed\nin one night, by the fire of the artillery alone.) The lightning\nflashed against the distant horizon, the sentry in the bastion shouted,\n"Can-non!" and the ball, shrieking over the heads of the corps, tore up\nthe earth, and sent the stones flying.\n\n"Deuce take it! how slowly they march," thought Praskukhin, glancing\nback continually, as he walked beside Mikhailoff. "Really, it will be\nbetter for me to run on in front; I have already given the order....\nBut no, it might be said later on that I was a coward. What will be\nwill be; I will march with them."\n\n"Now, why is he walking behind me?" thought Mikhailoff, on his side.\n"So far as I have observed, he always brings ill-luck. There it comes,\nflying straight for us, apparently."\n\nAfter traversing several hundred paces, they encountered Kalugin, who\nwas going to the casemates, clanking his sword boldly as he walked, in\norder to learn, by the general\'s command, how the work was progressing\nthere. But on meeting Mikhailoff, it occurred to him that, instead of\ngoing thither, under that terrible fire, which he was not ordered to\ndo, he could make minute inquiries of the officer who had been there.\nAnd, in fact, Mikhailoff furnished him with a detailed account of the\nwork. After walking a short distance with them, Kalugin turned into the\ntrench, which led to the casemate.\n\n"Well, what news is there?" inquired the officer, who was seated alone\nat the table, and eating his supper.\n\n"Well, nothing, apparently, except that there will not be any further\nconflict."\n\n"How so? On the contrary, the general has but just gone up to the top\nof the works. A regiment has already arrived. Yes, there it is ... do\nyou hear? The firing has begun again. Don\'t go. Why should you?" added\nthe officer, perceiving the movement made by Kalugin.\n\n"But I must be there without fail, in the present instance," thought\nKalugin, "but I have already subjected myself to a good deal of danger\nto-day; the firing is terrible."\n\n"Well, after all, I had better wait for him here," he said.\n\nIn fact, the general returned, twenty minutes later, accompanied by the\nofficers, who had been with him; among their number was the yunker,\nBaron Pesth, but Praskukhin was not with them. The lodgements had been\ncaptured and occupied by our forces.\n\nAfter receiving a full account of the engagement, Kalugin and Pesth\nwent out of the casemates.\n\n\nXI.\n\n"There is blood on your cloak; have you been having a hand-to-hand\nfight?" Kalugin asked him.\n\n"Oh, \'tis frightful! Just imagine...."\n\nAnd Pesth began to relate how he had led his company, how the commander\nof the company had been killed, how he had spitted a Frenchman, and\nhow, if it had not been for him, the battle would have been lost.\n\nThe foundations for this tale, that the company commander had been\nkilled, and that Pesth had killed a Frenchman, were correct; but, in\ngiving the details, the yunker had invented facts and bragged.\n\nHe bragged involuntarily, because, during the whole engagement, he had\nbeen in a kind of mist, and had forgotten himself to such a degree that\neverything which happened seemed to him to have happened somewhere,\nsometime, and with some one, and very naturally he had endeavored\nto bring out these details in a light which should be favorable to\nhimself. But what had happened in reality was this:--\n\nThe battalion to which the yunker had been ordered for the sortie had\nstood under fire for two hours, near a wall; then the commander of\nthe battalion said something, the company commanders made a move, the\nbattalion got under way, issued forth from behind the breastworks,\nmarched forward a hundred paces, and came to a halt in columns. Pesth\nhad been ordered to take his stand on the right flank of the second\ncompany.\n\nThe yunker stood his ground, absolutely without knowing where he was,\nor why he was there, and, with restrained breath, and with a cold chill\nrunning down his spine, he had stared stupidly straight ahead into the\ndark beyond, in the expectation of something terrible. But, since there\nwas no firing in progress, he did not feel so much terrified as he did\nqueer and strange at finding himself outside the fortress, in the open\nplain. Again the battalion commander ahead said something. Again the\nofficers had conversed in whispers, as they communicated the orders,\nand the black wall of the first company suddenly disappeared. They had\nbeen ordered to lie down. The second company lay down also, and Pesth,\nin the act, pricked his hand on something sharp. The only man who did\nnot lie down was the commander of the second company. His short form,\nwith the naked sword which he was flourishing, talking incessantly the\nwhile, moved about in front of the troop.\n\n"Children! my lads! ... look at me! Don\'t fire at them, but at them\nwith your bayonets, the dogs! When I shout, Hurrah! follow me close ...\nthe chief thing is to be as close together as possible ... let us show\nwhat we are made of! Do not let us cover ourselves with shame--shall we,\nhey, my children? For our father the Tsar!"\n\n"What is our company commander\'s surname?" Pesth inquired of a yunker,\nwho was lying beside him. "What a brave fellow he is!"\n\n"Yes, he\'s always that way in a fight ..." answered the yunker. "His\nname is Lisinkovsky."\n\nAt that moment, a flame flashed up in front of the company. There\nwas a crash, which deafened them all, stones and splinters flew high\nin the air (fifty seconds, at least, later a stone fell from above\nand crushed the foot of a soldier). This was a bomb from an elevated\nplatform, and the fact that it fell in the midst of the company proved\nthat the French had caught sight of the column.\n\n"So they are sending bombs!... Just let us get at you, and you shall\nfeel the bayonet of a three-sided Russian, curse you!" shouted the\ncommander of the company, in so loud a tone that the battalion\ncommander was forced to order him to be quiet and not to make so much\nnoise.\n\nAfter this the first company rose to their feet, and after it the\nsecond. They were ordered to fix bayonets, and the battalion advanced.\nPesth was so terrified that he absolutely could not recollect whether\nthey advanced far, or whither, or who did what. He walked like a\ndrunken man. But all at once millions of fires flashed from all sides,\nthere was a whistling and a crashing. He shrieked and ran, because\nthey were all shrieking and running. Then he stumbled and fell upon\nsomething. It was the company commander (who had been wounded at the\nhead of his men and who, taking the yunker for a Frenchman, seized him\nby the leg). Then when he had freed his leg, and risen to his feet,\nsome man ran against his back in the dark and almost knocked him down\nagain; another man shouted, "Run him through! what are you staring at!"\n\nThen he seized a gun, and ran the bayonet into something soft. "Ah,\nDieu!" exclaimed some one in a terribly piercing voice, and then only\ndid Pesth discover that he had transfixed a Frenchman. The cold sweat\nstarted out all over his body. He shook as though in a fever, and flung\naway the gun. But this lasted only a moment; it immediately occurred\nto him that he was a hero. He seized the gun again, and, shouting\n"Hurrah!" with the crowd, he rushed away from the dead Frenchman. After\nhaving traversed about twenty paces, he came to the trench. There he\nfound our men and the company commander.\n\n"I have run one man through!" he said to the commander.\n\n"You\'re a brave fellow, Baron."\n\n\nXII.\n\n"But, do you know, Praskukhin has been killed," said Pesth,\naccompanying Kalugin, on the way back.\n\n"It cannot be!"\n\n"But it can. I saw him myself."\n\n"Farewell; I am in a hurry."\n\n"I am well content," thought Kalugin, as he returned home; "I have had\nluck for the first time when on duty. That was a capital engagement,\nand I am alive and whole. There will be some fine presentations, and I\nshall certainly get a golden sword. And I deserve it too."\n\nAfter reporting to the general all that was necessary, he went to his\nroom, in which sat Prince Galtsin, who had returned long before, and\nwho was reading a book, which he had found on Kalugin\'s table, while\nwaiting for him.\n\nIt was with a wonderful sense of enjoyment that Kalugin found himself\nat home again, out of all danger, and, having donned his night-shirt\nand lain down on the sofa, he began to relate to Galtsin the\nparticulars of the affair, communicating them, naturally, from a point\nof view which made it appear that he, Kalugin, was a very active and\nvaliant officer, to which, in my opinion, it was superfluous to refer,\nseeing that every one knew it and that no one had any right to doubt\nit, with the exception, perhaps, of the deceased Captain Praskukhin,\nwho, in spite of the fact that he had considered it a piece of\nhappiness to walk arm in arm with Kalugin, had told a friend, only the\nevening before, in private, that Kalugin was a very fine man, but that,\nbetween you and me, he was terribly averse to going to the bastions.\n\nNo sooner had Praskukhin, who had been walking beside Mikhailoff,\ntaken leave of Kalugin, and, betaking himself to a safer place, had\nbegun to recover his spirits somewhat, than he caught sight of a flash\nof lightning behind him flaring up vividly, heard the shout of the\nsentinel, "Mortar!" and the words of the soldiers who were marching\nbehind, "It\'s flying straight at the bastion!"\n\nMikhailoff glanced round. The brilliant point of the bomb seemed to\nbe suspended directly over his head in such a position that it was\nabsolutely impossible to determine its course. But this lasted only\nfor a second. The bomb came faster and faster, nearer and nearer, the\nsparks of the fuse were already visible, and the fateful whistle was\naudible, and it descended straight in the middle of the battalion.\n\n"Lie down!" shouted a voice.\n\nMikhailoff and Praskukhin threw themselves on the ground. Praskukhin\nshut his eyes, and only heard the bomb crash against the hard earth\nsomewhere in the vicinity. A second passed, which seemed an hour--and\nthe bomb had not burst. Praskukhin was alarmed; had he felt cowardly\nfor nothing? Perhaps the bomb had fallen at a distance, and it merely\nseemed to him that the fuse was hissing near him. He opened his eyes,\nand saw with satisfaction that Mikhailoff was lying motionless on the\nearth, at his very feet. But then his eyes encountered for a moment the\nglowing fuse of the bomb, which was twisting about at a distance of an\narshin from him.\n\nA cold horror, which excluded every other thought and feeling, took\npossession of his whole being. He covered his face with his hands.\n\nAnother second passed--a second in which a whole world of thoughts,\nfeelings, hopes, and memories flashed through his mind.\n\n"Which will be killed, Mikhailoff or I? Or both together? And if it is\nI, where will it strike? If in the head, then all is over with me; but\nif in the leg, they will cut it off, and I shall ask them to be sure\nto give me chloroform,--and I may still remain among the living. But\nperhaps no one but Mikhailoff will be killed; then I will relate how\nwe were walking along together, and how he was killed and his blood\nspurted over me. No, it is nearer to me ... it will kill me!"\n\nThen he remembered the twenty rubles which he owed Mikhailoff, and\nrecalled another debt in Petersburg, which ought to have been paid long\nago; the gypsy air which he had sung the previous evening recurred\nto him. The woman whom he loved appeared to his imagination in a cap\nwith lilac ribbons, a man who had insulted him five years before, and\nwhom he had not paid off for his insult, came to his mind, though\ninextricably interwoven with these and with a thousand other memories\nthe feeling of the moment--the fear of death--never deserted him for an\ninstant.\n\n"But perhaps it will not burst," he thought, and, with the decision\nof despair, he tried to open his eyes. But at that instant, through\nthe crevice of his eyelids, his eyes were smitten with a red fire, and\nsomething struck him in the centre of the breast, with a frightful\ncrash; he ran off, he knew not whither, stumbled over his sword, which\nhad got between his legs, and fell over on his side.\n\n"Thank God! I am only bruised," was his first thought, and he tried\nto touch his breast with his hands; but his arms seemed fettered, and\npincers were pressing his head. The soldiers flitted before his eyes,\nand he unconsciously counted them: "One, two, three soldiers; and there\nis an officer, wrapped up in his cloak," he thought. Then a flash\npassed before his eyes, and he thought that something had been fired\noff; was it the mortars, or the cannon? It must have been the cannon.\nAnd there was still another shot; and there were more soldiers; five,\nsix, seven soldiers were passing by him. Then suddenly he felt afraid\nthat they would crush him. He wanted to shout to them that he was\nbruised; but his mouth was so dry that his tongue clove to his palate\nand he was tortured by a frightful thirst.\n\nHe felt that he was wet about the breast: this sensation of dampness\nreminded him of water, and he even wanted to drink this, whatever it\nwas. "I must have brought the blood when I fell," he thought, and,\nbeginning to give way more and more to terror, lest the soldiers who\npassed should crush him, he collected all his strength, and tried to\ncry: "Take me with you!" but, instead of this, he groaned so terribly\nthat it frightened him to hear himself. Then more red fires flashed in\nhis eyes--and it seemed to him as though the soldiers were laying stones\nupon him; the fires danced more and more rarely, the stones which they\npiled on him oppressed him more and more.\n\nHe exerted all his strength, in order to cast off the stones; he\nstretched himself out, and no longer saw or heard or thought or felt\nanything. He had been killed on the spot by a splinter of shell, in the\nmiddle of the breast.\n\n\nXIII.\n\nMikhailoff, on catching sight of the bomb, fell to the earth, and, like\nPraskukhin, he went over in thought and feeling an incredible amount in\nthose two seconds while the bomb lay there unexploded. He prayed to God\nmentally, and kept repeating: "Thy will be done!"\n\n"And why did I enter the military service?" he thought at the same\ntime; "and why, again, did I exchange into the infantry, in order to\ntake part in this campaign? Would it not have been better for me to\nremain in the regiment of Uhlans, in the town of T., and pass the time\nwith my friend Natasha? And now this is what has come of it."\n\nAnd he began to count, "One, two, three, four," guessing that if it\nburst on the even number, he would live, but if on the uneven number,\nthen he should be killed. "All is over; killed," he thought, when the\nbomb burst (he did not remember whether it was on the even or the\nuneven number), and he felt a blow, and a sharp pain in his head.\n"Lord, forgive my sins," he murmured, folding his hands, then rose, and\nfell back senseless.\n\nHis first sensation, when he came to himself, was the blood which was\nflowing from his nose, and a pain in his head, which had become much\nless powerful. "It is my soul departing," he thought.--"What will it\nbe like _there_? Lord, receive my soul in peace!--But one thing is\nstrange," he thought,--"and that is that, though dying, I can still hear\nso plainly the footsteps of the soldiers and the report of the shots."\n\n"Send some bearers ... hey there ... the captain is killed!" shouted a\nvoice over his head, which he recognized as the voice of his drummer\nIgnatieff.\n\nSome one grasped him by the shoulders. He made an effort to open his\neyes, and saw overhead the dark blue heavens, the clusters of stars,\nand two bombs, which were flying over him, one after the other; he saw\nIgnatieff, the soldiers with the stretcher, the walls of the trench,\nand all at once he became convinced that he was not yet in the other\nworld.\n\nHe had been slightly wounded in the head with a stone. His very first\nimpression was one resembling regret; he had so beautifully and so\ncalmly prepared himself for transit _yonder_ that a return to reality,\nwith its bombs, its trenches, and its blood, produced a disagreeable\neffect on him; his second impression was an involuntary joy that he\nwas alive, and the third a desire to leave the bastion as speedily\nas possible. The drummer bound up his commander\'s head with his\nhandkerchief, and, taking him under the arm, he led him to the place\nwhere the bandaging was going on.\n\n"But where am I going, and why?" thought the staff-captain, when\nhe recovered his senses a little.--"It is my duty to remain with my\nmen,--the more so as they will soon be out of range of the shots," some\nvoice whispered to him.\n\n"Never mind, brother," he said, pulling his arm away from the obliging\ndrummer. "I will not go to the field-hospital; I will remain with my\nmen."\n\nAnd he turned back.\n\n"You had better have your wound properly attended to, Your Honor,"\nsaid Ignatieff. "In the heat of the moment, it seems as if it were\na trifle; but it will be the worse if not attended to. There is some\ninflammation rising there ... really, now, Your Honor."\n\nMikhailoff paused for a moment in indecision, and would have\nfollowed Ignatieff\'s advice, in all probability, had he not called\nto mind how many severely wounded men there must needs be at the\nfield-hospital. "Perhaps the doctor will smile at my scratch," thought\nthe staff-captain, and he returned with decision to his men, wholly\nregardless of the drummer\'s admonitions.\n\n"And where is Officer Praskukhin, who was walking with me?" he asked\nthe lieutenant, who was leading the corps when they met.\n\n"I don\'t know--killed, probably," replied the lieutenant, reluctantly.\n\n"How is it that you do not know whether he was killed or wounded? He\nwas walking with us. And why have you not carried him with you?"\n\n"How could it be done, brother, when the place was so hot for us!"\n\n"Ah, how could you do such a thing, Mikhail Ivanowitch!" said\nMikhailoff, angrily.--"How could you abandon him if he was alive; and if\nhe was dead, you should still have brought away his body."\n\n"How could he be alive when, as I tell you, I went up to him and saw!"\nreturned the lieutenant.--"As you like, however! Only, his own men might\ncarry him off. Here, you dogs! the cannonade has abated," he added....\n\nMikhailoff sat down, and clasped his head, which the motion caused to\npain him terribly.\n\n"Yes, I must go and get him, without fail; perhaps he is still alive,"\nsaid Mikhailoff. "It is our duty, Mikhail Ivanowitch!"\n\nMikhail Ivanowitch made no reply.\n\n"He did not take him at the time, and now the soldiers must be sent\nalone--and how can they be sent? their lives may be sacrificed in vain,\nunder that hot fire," thought Mikhailoff.\n\n"Children! we must go back--and get the officer who was wounded there in\nthe ditch," he said, in not too loud and commanding a tone, for he felt\nhow unpleasant it would be to the soldiers to obey his order,--and, in\nfact, as he did not address any one in particular by name, no one set\nout to fulfil it.\n\n"It is quite possible that he is already dead, and it is _not worth\nwhile_ to subject the men to unnecessary danger; I alone am to blame\nfor not having seen to it. I will go myself and learn whether he is\nalive. It is my duty," said Mikhailoff to himself.\n\n"Mikhail Ivanowitch! Lead the men forward, and I will overtake you,"\nhe said, and, pulling up his cloak with one hand, and with the other\nconstantly touching the image of Saint Mitrofaniy, in which he\ncherished a special faith, he set off on a run along the trench.\n\nHaving convinced himself that Praskukhin was dead, he dragged himself\nback, panting, and supporting with his hand the loosened bandage and\nhis head, which began to pain him severely. The battalion had already\nreached the foot of the hill, and a place almost out of range of shots,\nwhen Mikhailoff overtook it. I say, _almost_ out of range, because some\nstray bombs struck here and there.\n\n"At all events, I must go to the hospital to-morrow, and put down my\nname," thought the staff-captain, as the medical student assisting the\ndoctors bound his wound.\n\n\nXIV.\n\nHundreds of bodies, freshly smeared with blood, of men who two hours\nprevious had been filled with divers lofty or petty hopes and desires,\nnow lay, with stiffened limbs, in the dewy, flowery valley which\nseparated the bastion from the trench, and on the level floor of the\nchapel for the dead in Sevastopol; hundreds of men crawled, twisted,\nand groaned, with curses and prayers on their parched lips, some amid\nthe corpses in the flower-strewn vale, others on stretchers, on cots,\nand on the blood-stained floor of the hospital.\n\nAnd still, as on the days preceding, the dawn glowed, over Sapun\nMountain, the twinkling stars paled, the white mist spread abroad\nfrom the dark sounding sea, the red glow illuminated the east, long\ncrimson cloudlets darted across the blue horizon; and still, as on days\npreceding, the powerful, all-beautiful sun rose up, giving promise of\njoy, love, and happiness to all who dwell in the world.\n\n\nXV.\n\nOn the following day, the band of the chasseurs was playing again on\nthe boulevard, and again officers, cadets, soldiers, and young women\nwere promenading in festive guise about the pavilion and through the\nlow-hanging alleys of fragrant white acacias in bloom.\n\nKalugin, Prince Galtsin, and some colonel or other were walking\narm-in-arm near the pavilion, and discussing the engagement of the day\nbefore. As always happens in such cases, the chief governing thread\nof the conversation was not the engagement itself, but the part which\nthose who were narrating the story of the affair took in it.\n\nTheir faces and the sound of their voices had a serious, almost\nmelancholy expression, as though the loss of the preceding day had\ntouched and saddened them deeply; but, to tell the truth, as none of\nthem had lost any one very near to him, this expression of sorrow was\nan official expression, which they merely felt it to be their duty to\nexhibit.\n\nOn the contrary, Kalugin and the colonel were ready to see an\nengagement of the same sort every day, provided that they might receive\na gold sword or the rank of major-general--notwithstanding the fact that\nthey were very fine fellows.\n\nI like it when any warrior who destroys millions to gratify his\nambition is called a monster. Only question any Lieutenant Petrushkoff,\nand Sub-Lieutenant Antonoff, and so on, on their word of honor, and\nevery one of them is a petty Napoleon, a petty monster, and ready to\nbring on a battle on the instant, to murder a hundred men, merely for\nthe sake of receiving an extra cross or an increase of a third in his\npay.\n\n"No, excuse me," said the colonel; "it began first on the left flank.\n_I was there myself._"\n\n"Possibly," answered Kalugin. "_I was farther on the right; I went\nthere twice. Once I was in search of the general, and the second time I\nwent merely to inspect the lodgements. It was a hot place._"\n\n"Yes, of course, Kalugin knows," said Prince Galtsin to the colonel.\n"You know that V. told me to-day that you were a brave fellow...."\n\n"But the losses, the losses were terrible," said the colonel. "_I lost\nfour hundred men from my regiment. It\'s a wonder that I escaped from\nthere alive._"\n\nAt this moment, the figure of Mikhailoff, with his head bandaged,\nappeared at the other extremity of the boulevard, coming to meet these\ngentlemen.\n\n"What, are you wounded, captain?" said Kalugin.\n\n"Yes, slightly, with a stone," replied Mikhailoff.\n\n"Has the flag been lowered yet?"[H] inquired Prince Galtsin, gazing\nover the staff-captain\'s cap, and addressing himself to no one in\nparticular.\n\n[H] This sentence is in French.\n\n"Non, pas encore," answered Mikhailoff, who wished to show that he\nunderstood and spoke French.\n\n"Is the truce still in force?" said Galtsin, addressing him courteously\nin Russian, and thereby intimating--so it seemed to the captain--It\nmust be difficult for you to speak French, so why is it not better to\ntalk in your own tongue simply?... And with this the adjutants left\nhim. The staff-captain again felt lonely, as on the preceding evening,\nand, exchanging salutes with various gentlemen,--some he did not care,\nand others he did not dare, to join,--he seated himself near Kazarsky\'s\nmonument, and lighted a cigarette.\n\nBaron Pesth also had come to the boulevard. He had been telling how he\nhad gone over to arrange the truce, and had conversed with the French\nofficers, and he declared that one had said to him, "If daylight had\nheld off another half-hour, these ambushes would have been retaken;"\nand that he had replied, "Sir, I refrain from saying no, in order not\nto give you the lie," and how well he had said it, and so on.\n\nBut, in reality, although he had had a hand in the truce, he had not\ndared to say anything very particular there, although he had been very\ndesirous of talking with the French (for it is awfully jolly to talk\nwith Frenchmen). Yunker Baron Pesth had marched up and down the line\nfor a long time, incessantly inquiring of the Frenchmen who were near\nhim: "To what regiment do you belong?" They answered him; and that was\nthe end of it.\n\nWhen he walked too far along the line, the French sentry, not\nsuspecting that this soldier understood French, cursed him. "He\nhas come to spy out our works, the cursed ..." said he; and, in\nconsequence, Yunker Baron Pesth, taking no further interest in the\ntruce, went home, and thought out on the way thither those French\nphrases, which he had now repeated. Captain Zoboff was also on the\nboulevard, talking loudly, and Captain Obzhogoff, in a very dishevelled\ncondition, and an artillery captain, who courted no one, and was happy\nin the love of the yunkers, and all the faces which had been there on\nthe day before, and all still actuated by the same motives. No one was\nmissing except Praskukhin, Neferdoff, and some others, whom hardly any\none remembered or thought of now, though their bodies were not yet\nwashed, laid out, and interred in the earth.\n\n\nXVI.\n\nWhite flags had been hung out from our bastion, and from the trenches\nof the French, and in the blooming valley between them lay disfigured\ncorpses, shoeless, in garments of gray or blue, which laborers were\nengaged in carrying off and heaping upon carts. The odor of the dead\nbodies filled the air. Throngs of people had poured out of Sevastopol,\nand from the French camp, to gaze upon this spectacle, and they pressed\none after the other with eager and benevolent curiosity.\n\nListen to what these people are saying.\n\nHere, in a group of Russians and French who have come together, is a\nyoung officer, who speaks French badly, but well enough to make himself\nunderstood, examining a cartridge-box of the guards.\n\n"And what is this bird here for?" says he.\n\n"Because it is a cartridge-box belonging to a regiment of the guards,\nMonsieur, and bears the Imperial eagle."\n\n"And do you belong to the guard?"\n\n"Pardon, Monsieur, I belong to the sixth regiment of the line."\n\n"And this--bought where?" asks the officer, pointing to a cigar-holder\nof yellow wood, in which the Frenchman was smoking his cigarette.\n\n"At Balaklava, Monsieur. It is very plain, of palm-wood."\n\n"Pretty!" says the officer, guided in his conversation not so much by\nhis own wishes as by the words which he knows.\n\n"If you will have the kindness to keep it as a souvenir of this\nmeeting, you will confer an obligation on me."\n\nAnd the polite Frenchman blows out the cigarette, and hands the holder\nover to the officer with a little bow. The officer gives him his, and\nall the members of the group, Frenchmen as well as Russians, appear\nvery much pleased and smile.\n\nThen a bold infantryman, in a pink shirt, with his cloak thrown over\nhis shoulders, accompanied by two other soldiers, who, with their\nhands behind their backs, were standing behind him, with merry, curious\ncountenances, stepped up to a Frenchman, and requested a light for his\npipe. The Frenchman brightened his fire, stirred up his short pipe, and\nshook out a light for the Russian.\n\n"Tobacco good!" said the soldier in the pink shirt; and the spectators\nsmile.\n\n"Yes, good tobacco, Turkish tobacco," says the Frenchman. "And your\ntobacco--Russian?--good?"\n\n"Russian, good," says the soldier in the pink shirt: whereupon\nthose present shake with laughter. "The French not good--_bon jour,\nMonsieur_," says the soldier in the pink shirt, letting fly his entire\ncharge of knowledge in the language at once, as he laughs and taps the\nFrenchman on the stomach. The French join in the laugh.\n\n"They are not handsome, these beasts of Russians," says a zouave, amid\nthe crowd of Frenchmen.\n\n"What are they laughing about?" says another black-complexioned one,\nwith an Italian accent, approaching our men.\n\n"Caftan good," says the audacious soldier, staring at the zouave\'s\nembroidered coat-skirts, and then there is another laugh.\n\n"Don\'t leave your lines; back to your places, _sacre nom_!" shouts a\nFrench corporal, and the soldiers disperse with evident reluctance.\n\nIn the meantime, our young cavalry officer is making the tour of the\nFrench officers. The conversation turns on some Count Sazonoff, "with\nwhom I was very well acquainted, Monsieur," says a French officer, with\none epaulet--"he is one of those real Russian counts, of whom we are so\nfond."\n\n"There is a Sazonoff with whom I am acquainted," said the cavalry\nofficer, "but he is not a count, so far as I know, at least; a little\ndark-complexioned man, of about your age."\n\n"Exactly, Monsieur, that is the man. Oh, how I should like to see that\ndear count! If you see him, pray, present my compliments to him--Captain\nLatour," says he, bowing.\n\n"Isn\'t this a terrible business that we are conducting here? It was\nhot work last night, wasn\'t it?" says the cavalry officer, wishing to\ncontinue the conversation, and pointing to the dead bodies.\n\n"Oh, frightful, Monsieur! But what brave fellows your soldiers are--what\nbrave fellows! It is a pleasure to fight with such valiant fellows."\n\n"It must be admitted that your men do not hang back, either," says the\ncavalry-man, with a bow, and the conviction that he is very amiable.\n\nBut enough of this.\n\nLet us rather observe this lad of ten, clad in an ancient cap, his\nfather\'s probably, shoes worn on bare feet, and nankeen breeches, held\nup by a single suspender, who had climbed over the wall at the very\nbeginning of the truce, and has been roaming about the ravine, staring\nwith dull curiosity at the French, and at the bodies which are lying\non the earth, and plucking the blue wild-flowers with which the valley\nis studded. On his way home with a large bouquet, he held his nose\nbecause of the odor which the wind wafted to him, and paused beside\na pile of corpses, which had been carried off the field, and stared\nlong at one terrible headless body, which chanced to be the nearest to\nhim. After standing there for a long while, he stepped up closer, and\ntouched with his foot the stiffened arm of the corpse which protruded.\nThe arm swayed a little. He touched it again, and with more vigor.\nThe arm swung back, and then fell into place again. And at once the\nboy uttered a shriek, hid his face in the flowers, and ran off to the\nfortifications as fast as he could go.\n\nYes, white flags are hung out from the bastion and the trenches, the\nflowery vale is filled with dead bodies, the splendid sun sinks into\nthe blue sea, and the blue sea undulates and glitters in the golden\nrays of the sun. Thousands of people congregate, gaze, talk, and smile\nat each other. And why do not Christian people, who profess the one\ngreat law of love and self-sacrifice, when they behold what they have\nwrought, fall in repentance upon their knees before Him who, when he\ngave them life, implanted in the soul of each of them, together with a\nfear of death, a love of the good and the beautiful, and, with tears\nof joy and happiness, embrace each other like brothers? No! But it\nis a comfort to think that it was not we who began this war, that we\nare only defending our own country, our father-land. The white flags\nhave been hauled in, and again the weapons of death and suffering are\nshrieking; again innocent blood is shed, and groans and curses are\naudible.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI have now said all that I wish to say at this time. But a heavy\nthought overmasters me. Perhaps it should not have been said;\nperhaps what I have said belongs to one of those evil truths which,\nunconsciously concealed in the soul of each man, should not be uttered,\nlest they become pernicious, as a cask of wine should not be shaken,\nlest it be thereby spoiled.\n\nWhere is the expression of evil which should be avoided? Where is the\nexpression of good which should be imitated in this sketch? Who is the\nvillain, who the hero? All are good, and all are evil.\n\nNeither Kalugin, with his brilliant bravery--_bravoure de\ngentilhomme_--and his vanity, the instigator of all his deeds; nor\nPraskukhin, the empty-headed, harmless man, though he fell in battle\nfor the faith, the throne, and his native land; nor Mikhailoff,\nwith his shyness; nor Pesth, a child with no firm convictions or\nprinciples, can be either the heroes or the villains of the tale.\n\nThe hero of my tale, whom I love with all the strength of my soul, whom\nI have tried to set forth in all his beauty, and who has always been,\nis, and always will be most beautiful, is--the truth.\n\n\n\n\nSEVASTOPOL IN AUGUST, 1855.\n\n\nI.\n\nAt the end of August, along the rocky highway to Sevastopol, between\nDuvanka and Bakhtchisarai, through the thick, hot dust, at a foot-pace,\ndrove an officer\'s light cart, that peculiar _telyezhka_, not now to\nbe met with, which stands about half-way between a Jewish _britchka_,\na Russian travelling-carriage, and a basket-wagon. In the front of\nthe wagon, holding the reins, squatted the servant, clad in a nankeen\ncoat and an officer\'s cap, which had become quite limp; seated behind,\non bundles and packages covered with a military coat, was an infantry\nofficer, in a summer cloak.\n\nAs well as could be judged from his sitting position, the officer was\nnot tall in stature, but extremely thick, and that not so much from\nshoulder to shoulder as from chest to back; he was broad and thick,\nand his neck and the base of the head were excessively developed and\nswollen. His waist, so called, a receding strip in the centre of the\nbody, did not exist in his case; but neither had he any belly; on\nthe contrary, he was rather thin than otherwise, particularly in the\nface, which was overspread with an unhealthy yellowish sunburn. His\nface would have been handsome had it not been for a certain bloated\nappearance, and the soft, yet not elderly, heavy wrinkles that flowed\ntogether and enlarged his features, imparting to the whole countenance\na general expression of coarseness and of lack of freshness. His eyes\nwere small, brown, extremely searching, even bold; his moustache was\nvery thick, but the ends were kept constantly short by his habit of\ngnawing them; and his chin, and his cheek-bones in particular were\ncovered with a remarkably strong, thick, and black beard, of two days\'\ngrowth.\n\nThe officer had been wounded on the 10th of May, by a splinter, in the\nhead, on which he still wore a bandage, and, having now felt perfectly\nwell for the last week, he had come out of the Simferopol Hospital, to\nrejoin his regiment, which was stationed somewhere in the direction\nfrom which shots could be heard; but whether that was in Sevastopol\nitself, on the northern defences, or at Inkermann, he had not so far\nsucceeded in ascertaining with much accuracy from any one.\n\nShots were still audible near at hand, especially at intervals, when\nthe hills did not interfere, or when borne on the wind with great\ndistinctness and frequency, and apparently near at hand. Then it seemed\nas though some explosion shook the air, and caused an involuntary\nshudder. Then, one after the other, followed less resounding reports in\nquick succession, like a drum-beat, interrupted at times by a startling\nroar. Then, everything mingled in a sort of reverberating crash,\nresembling peals of thunder, when a thunder-storm is in full force, and\nthe rain has just begun to pour down in floods, every one said; and it\ncould be heard that the bombardment was progressing frightfully.\n\nThe officer kept urging on his servant, and seemed desirous of\narriving as speedily as possible. They were met by a long train of the\nRussian-peasant type, which had carried provisions into Sevastopol, and\nwas now returning with sick and wounded soldiers in gray coats, sailors\nin black paletots, volunteers in red fezes, and bearded militia-men.\nThe officer\'s light cart had to halt in the thick, immovable cloud of\ndust raised by the carts, and the officer, blinking and frowning with\nthe dust that stuffed his eyes and ears, gazed at the faces of the sick\nand wounded as they passed.\n\n"Ah, there\'s a sick soldier from our company," said the servant,\nturning to his master, and pointing to the wagon which was just on a\nline with them, full of wounded, at the moment.\n\nOn the cart, towards the front, a bearded Russian, in a lamb\'s-wool\ncap, was seated sidewise, and, holding the stock of his whip under\nhis elbow, was tying on the lash. Behind him in the cart, about five\nsoldiers, in different positions, were shaking about. One, though pale\nand thin, with his arm in a bandage, and his cloak thrown on over his\nshirt, was sitting up bravely in the middle of the cart, and tried\nto touch his cap on seeing the officer, but immediately afterwards\n(recollecting, probably, that he was wounded) he pretended that he only\nwanted to scratch his head. Another, beside him, was lying flat on the\nbottom of the wagon; all that was visible was two hands, as they clung\nto the rails of the wagon, and his knees uplifted limp as mops, as they\nswayed about in various directions. A third, with a swollen face and a\nbandaged head, on which was placed his soldier\'s cap, sat on one side,\nwith his legs dangling over the wheel, and, with his elbows resting on\nhis knees, seemed immersed in thought. It was to him that the passing\nofficer addressed himself.\n\n"Dolzhnikoff!" he exclaimed.\n\n"Here," replied the soldier, opening his eyes, and pulling off his cap,\nin such a thick and halting bass voice that it seemed as though twenty\nsoldiers had uttered an exclamation at one and the same time.\n\n"When were you wounded, brother?"\n\nThe leaden and swimming eyes of the soldier grew animated; he evidently\nrecognized his officer.\n\n"I wish Your Honor health!" he began again, in the same abrupt bass as\nbefore.\n\n"Where is the regiment stationed now?"\n\n"It was stationed in Sevastopol, but they were to move on Wednesday,\nYour Honor."\n\n"Where to?"\n\n"I don\'t know; it must have been to the Sivernaya, Your Honor! To-day,\nYour Honor," he added, in a drawling voice, as he put on his cap,\n"they have begun to fire clear across, mostly with bombs, that even go\nas far as the bay; they are fighting horribly to-day, so that--"\n\nIt was impossible to hear what the soldier said further; but it was\nevident, from the expression of his countenance and from his attitude,\nthat he was uttering discouraging remarks, with the touch of malice of\na man who is suffering.\n\nThe travelling officer, Lieutenant Kozeltzoff, was no common officer.\nHe was not one of those that live so and so and do thus and so because\nothers live and do thus; he did whatever he pleased, and others did the\nsame, and were convinced that it was well. He was rather richly endowed\nby nature with small gifts: he sang well, played on the guitar, talked\nvery cleverly, and wrote very easily, particularly official documents,\nin which he had practised his hand in his capacity of adjutant of the\nbattalion; but the most noticeable trait in his character was his\negotistical energy, which, although chiefly founded on this array of\npetty talents, constituted in itself a sharp and striking trait. His\negotism was of the sort that is most frequently found developed in\nmasculine and especially in military circles, and which had become a\npart of his life to such a degree that he understood no other choice\nthan to domineer or to humiliate himself; and his egotism was the\nmainspring even of his private impulses; he liked to usurp the first\nplace over people with whom he put himself on a level.\n\n"Well! it\'s absurd of me to listen to what a Moskva[I] chatters!"\nmuttered the lieutenant, experiencing a certain weight of apathy in\nhis heart, and a dimness of thought, which the sight of the transport\nfull of wounded and the words of the soldier, whose significance was\nemphasized and confirmed by the sounds of the bombardment, had left\nwith him. "_That Moskva is ridiculous!_ Drive on, Nikolaeff! go ahead!\nAre you asleep?" he added, rather fretfully, to the servant, as he\nre-arranged the skirts of his coat.\n\n[I] In many regiments the officers call a soldier, half in scorn, half\ncaressingly, _Moskva_ (Moscovite), or _prisyaga_ (an oath).\n\nThe reins were tightened, Nikolaeff clacked his lips, and the wagon\nmoved on at a trot.\n\n"We will only halt a minute for food, and will proceed at once, this\nvery day," said the officer.\n\n\nII.\n\nAs he entered the street of the ruined remains of the stone wall,\nforming the Tatar houses of Duvanka, Lieutenant Kozeltzoff was stopped\nby a transport of bombs and grape-shot, which were on their way to\nSevastopol, and had accumulated on the road. Two infantry soldiers\nwere seated in the dust, on the stones of a ruined garden-wall by the\nroadside, devouring a watermelon and bread.\n\n"Have you come far, fellow-countryman?" said one of them, as he chewed\nhis bread, to the soldier, with a small knapsack on his back, who had\nhalted near them.\n\n"I have come from my government to join my regiment," replied the\nsoldier, turning his eyes away from the watermelon, and readjusting the\nsack on his back. "There we were, two weeks ago, at work on the hay,\na whole troop of us; but now they have drafted all of us, and we don\'t\nknow where our regiment is at the present time. They say that our men\nwent on the Korabelnaya last week. Have you heard anything, gentlemen?"\n\n"It\'s stationed in the town, brother," said the second, an old soldier\nof the reserves, digging away with his clasp-knife at the white, unripe\nmelon. "We have just come from there, this afternoon. It\'s terrible, my\nbrother!"\n\n"How so, gentlemen?"\n\n"Don\'t you hear how they are firing all around to-day, so that there\nis not a whole spot anywhere? It is impossible to say how many of our\nbrethren have been killed." And the speaker waved his hand and adjusted\nhis cap.\n\nThe passing soldier shook his head thoughtfully, gave a clack with his\ntongue, then pulled his pipe from his boot-leg, and, without filling\nit, stirred up the half-burned tobacco, lit a bit of tinder from the\nsoldier who was smoking, and raised his cap.\n\n"There is no one like God, gentlemen! Good-bye," said he, and, with a\nshake of the sack on his back, he went his way.\n\n"Hey, there! you\'d better wait," said the man who was digging out the\nwatermelon, with an air of conviction.\n\n"It makes no difference!" muttered the traveller, threading his way\namong the wheels of the assembled transports.\n\n\nIII.\n\nThe posting-station was full of people when Kozeltzoff drove up to it.\nThe first person whom he encountered, on the porch itself, was a thin\nand very young man, the superintendent, who continued his altercation\nwith two officers, who had followed him out.\n\n"It\'s not three days only, but ten that you will have to wait. Even\ngenerals wait, my good sirs!" said the superintendent, with a desire to\nadminister a prick to the travellers; "and I am not going to harness up\nfor you."\n\n"Then don\'t give anybody horses, if there are none! But why furnish\nthem to some lackey or other with baggage?" shouted the elder of the\ntwo officers, with a glass of tea in his hand, and plainly avoiding the\nuse of pronouns,[J] but giving it to be understood that he might very\neasily address the superintendent as "_thou_."\n\n[J] This effect cannot be reproduced in English.\n\n"Judge for yourself, now, Mr. Superintendent," said the younger\nofficer, with some hesitation. "We don\'t want to go for our own\npleasure. We must certainly be needed, since we have been called for.\nAnd I certainly shall report to the general. But this, of course,--you\nknow that you are not paying proper respect to the military profession."\n\n"You are always spoiling things," the elder man interrupted, with\nvexation. "You only hinder me; you must know how to talk to them. Here,\nnow, he has lost his respect. Horses this very instant, I say!"\n\n"I should be glad to give them to you, _batiushka_,[K] but where am I\nto get them?"\n\n[K] "My good sir," a familiarly respectful mode of address.\n\nAfter a brief silence, the superintendent began to grow irritated, and\nto talk, flourishing his hands the while.\n\n"I understand, _batiushka_. And I know all about it myself. But what\nare you going to do? Only give me"--here a ray of hope gleamed across\nthe faces of the officers--"only give me a chance to live until the end\nof the month, and you won\'t see me here any longer. I\'d rather go on\nthe Malakhoff tower, by Heavens! than stay here. Let them do what they\nplease about it! There\'s not a single sound team in the station this\nday, and the horses haven\'t seen a wisp of hay these three days." And\nthe superintendent disappeared behind the gate.\n\nKozeltzoff entered the room in company with the officers.\n\n"Well," said the elder officer, quite calmly, to the younger one,\nalthough but a second before he had appeared to be greatly irritated,\n"we have been travelling these three weeks, and we will wait a little\nlonger. There\'s no harm done. We shall get there at last."\n\nThe dirty, smoky apartment was so filled with officers and trunks that\nit was with difficulty that Kozeltzoff found a place near the window,\nwhere he seated himself; he began to roll himself a cigarette, as he\nglanced at the faces and lent an ear to the conversations.\n\nTo the right of the door, near a crippled and greasy table, upon which\nstood two samovars, whose copper had turned green in spots, here and\nthere, and where sugar was portioned out in various papers, sat the\nprincipal group. A young officer, without moustache, in a new, short,\nwadded summer coat, was pouring water into the teapot.\n\nFour such young officers were there, in different corners of the room.\nOne of them had placed a cloak under his head, and was fast asleep on\nthe sofa. Another, standing by the table, was cutting up some roast\nmutton for an officer without an arm, who was seated at the table.\n\nTwo officers, one in an adjutant\'s cloak, the other in an infantry\ncloak, a thin one however, and with a satchel strapped over his\nshoulder, were sitting near the oven bench, and it was evident, from\nthe very way in which they stared at the rest, and from the manner in\nwhich the one with the satchel smoked his cigar, that they were not\nline officers on duty at the front, and that they were delighted at it.\n\nNot that there was any scorn apparent in their manner, but there was a\ncertain self-satisfied tranquillity, founded partly on money and partly\non their close intimacy with generals, a certain consciousness of\nsuperiority which even extended to a desire to hide it.\n\nA thick-lipped young doctor and an officer of artillery, with a German\ncast of countenance, were seated almost on the feet of the young\nofficer who was sleeping on the sofa, and counting over their money.\n\nThere were four officers\' servants, some dozing and others busy with\nthe trunks and packages near the door.\n\nAmong all these faces, Kozeltzoff did not find a single familiar\none; but he began to listen with curiosity to the conversation. The\nyoung officers, who, as he decided from their looks alone, had but\njust come out of the military academy, pleased him, and, what was the\nprincipal point, they reminded him that his brother had also come from\nthe academy, and should have joined recently one of the batteries of\nSevastopol.\n\nBut the officer with the satchel, whose face he had seen before\nsomewhere, seemed bold and repulsive to him. He even left the window,\nand, going to the stove-bench, seated himself on it, with the thought\nthat he would put the fellow down if he took it into his head to say\nanything. In general, purely as a brave "line" officer, he did not like\n"the staff," such as he had recognized these two officers to be at the\nfirst glance.\n\n\nIV.\n\n"But this is dreadfully annoying," said one of the young officers, "to\nbe so near, and yet not be able to get there. Perhaps there will be an\naction this very day, and we shall not be there."\n\nIn the sharp voice and the mottled freshness of the color that swept\nacross the youthful face of this officer as he spoke there was apparent\nthe sweet young timidity of the man who is constantly afraid lest his\nevery word shall not turn out exactly right.\n\nThe one-armed officer glanced at him with a smile.\n\n"You will get there soon enough, I assure you," he said.\n\nThe young officer looked with respect at the haggard face of the\narmless officer, so unexpectedly illuminated by a smile, held his peace\nfor a while, and busied himself once more with his tea. In fact, the\none-armed officer\'s face, his attitude, and, most of all, the empty\nsleeve of his coat, expressed much of that tranquil indifference that\nmay be explained in this way--that he looked upon every conversation and\nevery occurrence as though saying, "That is all very fine; I know all\nabout that, and I can do a little of that myself, if I only choose."\n\n"What is our decision to be?" said the young officer again to his\ncompanion in the short coat. "Shall we pass the night here, or shall we\nproceed with our own horses?"\n\nHis comrade declined to proceed.\n\n"Just imagine, captain," said the one who was pouring the tea, turning\nto the one-armed man, and picking up the knife that the latter had\ndropped, "they told us that horses were frightfully dear in Sevastopol,\nso we bought a horse in partnership at Simferopol."\n\n"They made you pay pretty high for it, I fancy."\n\n"Really, I do not know, captain; we paid ninety rubles for it and the\nteam. Is that very dear?" he added, turning to all the company, and to\nKozeltzoff, who was staring at him.\n\n"It was not dear, if the horse is young," said Kozeltzoff.\n\n"Really! but they told us that it was dear. Only, she limps a little,\nbut that will pass off. They told us that she was very strong."\n\n"What academy are you from?" asked Kozeltzoff, who wished to inquire\nfor his brother.\n\n"We are just from the academy of the nobility; there are six of us, and\nwe are on our way to Sevastopol at our own desire," said the talkative\nyoung officer. "But we do not know where our battery is; some say that\nit is in Sevastopol, others that it is at Odessa."\n\n"Was it not possible to find out at Simferopol?" asked Kozeltzoff.\n\n"They do not know there. Just imagine, one of our comrades went to\nthe headquarters there, and they were impertinent to him. You can\nimagine how disagreeable that was! Would you like to have me make you\na cigarette," he said at that moment to the one-armed officer, who was\njust pulling out his cigarette-machine.\n\nHe waited on the latter with a sort of servile enthusiasm.\n\n"And are you from Sevastopol also?" he went on. "Oh, good Heavens,\nhow wonderful that is! How much we did think of you, and of all our\nheroes, in Petersburg," he said, turning to Kozeltzoff with respect and\ngood-natured flattery.\n\n"And now, perhaps, you may have to go back?" inquired the lieutenant.\n\n"That is just what we are afraid of. You can imagine that, after having\nbought the horse, and provided ourselves with all the necessaries,--a\ncoffee-pot with a spirit-lamp, and other indispensable trifles,--we\nhave no money left," he said, in a low voice, as he glanced at his\ncompanions; "so that, if we do have to go back, we don\'t know what is\nto be done."\n\n"Have you received no money for travelling expenses?" inquired\nKozeltzoff.\n\n"No," replied he, in a whisper; "they only promised to give it to us\nhere."\n\n"Have you the certificate?"\n\n"I know that--the principal thing--is the certificate; but a senator in\nMoscow,--he\'s my uncle,--when I was at his house, said that they would\ngive it to us here; otherwise, he would have given me some himself. So\nthey will give it to us here?"\n\n"Most certainly they will."\n\n"I too think that they will," he said, in a tone which showed\nthat, after having made the same identical inquiry in thirty\nposting-stations, and having everywhere received different answers, he\nno longer believed any one implicitly.\n\n\nV.\n\n"Who ordered beet-soup?" called out the slatternly mistress of the\nhouse, a fat woman of forty, as she entered the room with a bowl of\nsoup.\n\nThe conversation ceased at once, and all who were in the room fixed\ntheir eyes on the woman.\n\n"Ah, it was Kozeltzoff who ordered it," said the young officer. "He\nmust be waked. Get up for your dinner," he said, approaching the\nsleeper on the sofa, and jogging his elbow.\n\nA young lad of seventeen, with merry black eyes and red cheeks, sprang\nenergetically from the sofa, and stood in the middle of the room,\nrubbing his eyes.\n\n"Ah, excuse me, please," he said to the doctor, whom he had touched in\nrising.\n\nLieutenant Kozeltzoff recognized his brother immediately, and stepped\nup to him.\n\n"Don\'t you know me?" he said with a smile.\n\n"A-a-a-!" exclaimed the younger brother; "this is astonishing!" And he\nbegan to kiss his brother.\n\nThey kissed twice, but stopped at the third repetition as though the\nthought had occurred to both of them:--\n\n"Why is it necessary to do it exactly three times?"\n\n"Well, how delighted I am!" said the elder, looking at his brother.\n"Let us go out on the porch; we can have a talk."\n\n"Come, come, I don\'t want any soup. You eat it, Federsohn!" he said to\nhis comrade.\n\n"But you wanted something to eat."\n\n"I don\'t want anything."\n\nWhen they emerged on the porch, the younger kept asking his brother:\n"Well, how are you; tell me all about it." And still he kept on saying\nhow glad he was to see him, but he told nothing himself.\n\nWhen five minutes had elapsed, during which time they had succeeded in\nbecoming somewhat silent, the elder brother inquired why the younger\nhad not gone into the guards, as they had all expected him to do.\n\nHe wanted to get to Sevastopol as speedily as possible, he said; for\nif things turned out favorably there, he could get advancement more\nrapidly there than in the guards. There it takes ten years to reach\nthe grade of colonel, while here Todleben had risen in two years from\nlieutenant-colonel to general. Well, and if one did get killed, there\nwas nothing to be done.\n\n"What a fellow you are!" said his brother, smiling.\n\n"But the principal thing, do you know, brother," said the younger,\nsmiling and blushing as though he were preparing to say something\nvery disgraceful, "all this is nonsense, and the principal reason why\nI asked it was that I was ashamed to live in Petersburg when men are\ndying for their country here. Yes, and I wanted to be with you," he\nadded, with still greater shamefacedness.\n\n"How absurd you are!" said the elder brother, pulling out his\ncigarette-machine, and not even glancing at him. "It\'s a pity, though,\nthat we can\'t be together."\n\n"Now, honestly, is it so terrible in the bastions?" inquired the\nyounger man, abruptly.\n\n"It is terrible at first, but you get used to it afterwards. It\'s\nnothing. You will see for yourself."\n\n"And tell me still another thing. What do you think?--will Sevastopol be\ntaken? I think that it will not."\n\n"God knows!"\n\n"But one thing is annoying. Just imagine what bad luck! A whole bundle\nwas stolen from us on the road, and it had my shako in it, so that\nnow I am in a dreadful predicament; and I don\'t know how I am to show\nmyself."\n\nThe younger Kozeltzoff, Vladimir, greatly resembled his brother\nMikhail, but he resembled him as a budding rose-bush resembles one\nthat is out of flower. His hair was chestnut also, but it was thick\nand lay in curls on his temples. On the soft white back of his neck\nthere was a blond lock; a sign of good luck, so the nurses say. The\nfull-blooded crimson of youth did not stand fixed on the soft, white\nhue of his face, but flashed up and betrayed all the movements of his\nmind. He had the same eyes as his brother, but they were more widely\nopened, and clearer, which appeared the more peculiar because they were\nveiled frequently by a slight moisture. A golden down was sprouting\non his cheeks, and over his ruddy lips, which were often folded into\na shy smile, displaying teeth of dazzling whiteness. He was a well\nformed and broad-shouldered fellow, in unbuttoned coat, from beneath\nwhich was visible a red shirt with collar turned back. As he stood\nbefore his brother, leaning his elbows on the railing of the porch,\nwith cigarette in hand and innocent joy in his face and gesture, he was\nso agreeable and comely a youth that any one would have gazed at him\nwith delight. He was extremely pleased with his brother, he looked at\nhim with respect and pride, fancying him his hero; but in some ways, so\nfar as judgments on worldly culture, ability to talk French, behavior\nin the society of distinguished people, dancing, and so on, he was\nsomewhat ashamed of him, looked down on him, and even cherished a hope\nof improving him if such a thing were possible.\n\nAll his impressions, so far, were from Petersburg, at the house of\na lady who was fond of good-looking young fellows, and who had had\nhim spend his holidays with her, and from Moscow, at the house of a\nsenator, where he had once danced at a great ball.\n\n\nVI.\n\nHaving nearly talked their fill and having arrived at the feeling that\nyou frequently experience, that there is little in common between you,\nthough you love one another, the brothers were silent for a few moments.\n\n"Pick up your things and we will set out at once," said the elder.\n\nThe younger suddenly blushed, stammered, and became confused.\n\n"Are we to go straight to Sevastopol?" he inquired, after a momentary\npause.\n\n"Why, yes. You can\'t have many things, and we can manage to carry them,\nI think."\n\n"Very good! we will start at once," said the younger, with a sigh, and\nhe went inside.\n\nBut he paused in the vestibule without opening the door, dropped his\nhead gloomily, and began to reflect.\n\n"Straight to Sevastopol, on the instant, within range of the\nbombs--frightful! It\'s no matter, however; it must have come sometime.\nNow, at all events, with my brother--"\n\nThe fact was that it was only now, at the thought that, once seated\nin the cart, he should enter Sevastopol without dismounting from it,\nand that no chance occurrence could any longer detain him, that the\ndanger which he was seeking clearly presented itself to him, and he was\ntroubled at the very thought of its nearness. He managed to control\nhimself in some way, and entered the room; but a quarter of an hour\nelapsed, and still he had not rejoined his brother, so that the latter\nopened the door at last, in order to call him. The younger Kozeltzoff,\nin the attitude of a naughty school-boy, was saying something to an\nofficer named P. When his brother opened the door, he became utterly\nconfused.\n\n"Immediately. I\'ll come out in a minute!" he cried, waving his hand at\nhis brother. "Wait for me there, please."\n\nA moment later he emerged, in fact, and approached his brother, with a\ndeep sigh.\n\n"Just imagine! I cannot go with you, brother," he said.\n\n"What? What nonsense is this?"\n\n"I will tell you the whole truth, Misha! Not one of us has any money,\nand we are all in debt to that staff-captain whom you saw there. It is\nhorribly mortifying!"\n\nThe elder brother frowned, and did not break the silence for a long\nwhile.\n\n"Do you owe much?" he asked, glancing askance at his brother.\n\n"A great deal--no, not a great deal; but I am dreadfully ashamed of it.\nHe has paid for me for three stages, and all his sugar is gone, so that\nI do not know--yes, and we played at preference. I am a little in his\ndebt there, too."\n\n"This is bad, Volodya! Now, what would you have done if you had not met\nme?" said the elder, sternly, without looking at his brother.\n\n"Why, I was thinking, brother, that I should get that travelling-money\nat Sevastopol, and that I would give him that. Surely, that can be\ndone; and it will be better for me to go with him to-morrow."\n\nThe elder brother pulled out his purse, and, with fingers that shook a\nlittle, he took out two ten-ruble notes and one for three rubles.\n\n"This is all the money I have," said he. "How much do you owe?"\n\nKozeltzoff did not speak the exact truth when he said that this was all\nthe money he had. He had, besides, four gold pieces sewn into his cuff,\nin case of an emergency; but he had taken a vow not to touch them.\n\nIt appeared that Kozeltzoff, what with preference and sugar, was in\ndebt to the amount of eight rubles only. The elder brother gave him\nthis sum, merely remarking that one should not play preference when one\nhad no money.\n\n"What did you play for?"\n\nThe younger brother answered not a word. His brother\'s question seemed\nto him to cast a reflection on his honor. Vexation at himself, a shame\nat his conduct, which could give rise to such a suspicion, and the\ninsult from his brother, of whom he was so fond, produced upon his\nsensitive nature so deeply painful an impression that he made no reply.\nSensible that he was not in a condition to restrain the sobs which rose\nin his throat, he took the money without glancing at it, and went back\nto his comrades.\n\n\nVII.\n\nNikolaeff, who had fortified himself at Duvanka, with two jugs of\nvodka, purchased from a soldier who was peddling it on the bridge, gave\nthe reins a jerk, and the team jolted away over the stony road, shaded\nhere and there, which led along the Belbek to Sevastopol; but the\nbrothers, whose legs jostled each other, maintained a stubborn silence,\nalthough they were thinking of each other every instant.\n\n"Why did he insult me?" thought the younger. "Could he not have held\nhis tongue about that? It is exactly as though he thought that I was a\nthief; yes, and now he is angry, apparently, so that we have quarrelled\nfor good. And how splendid it would have been for us to be together in\nSevastopol. Two brothers, on friendly terms, both fighting the foe!\none of them, the elder, though not very cultivated, yet a valiant\nwarrior, and the other younger, but a brave fellow too. In a week\'s\ntime I would have showed them that I am not such a youngster after all!\nI shall cease to blush, there will be manliness in my countenance,\nand, though my moustache is not very large now, it would grow to a\ngood size by that time;" and he felt of the down which was making its\nappearance round the edges of his mouth. "Perhaps we shall arrive\nto-day, and get directly into the conflict, my brother and I. He must\nbe obstinate and very brave, one of those who do not say much, but act\nbetter than others. I should like to know," he continued, "whether he\nis squeezing me against the side of the wagon on purpose or not. He\nprobably is conscious that I feel awkward, and he is pretending not\nto notice me. We shall arrive to-day," he went on with his argument,\npressing close to the side of the wagon, and fearing to move lest his\nbrother should observe that he was uncomfortable, "and, all at once,\nwe shall go straight to the bastion. We shall both go together, I with\nmy equipments, and my brother with his company. All of a sudden, the\nFrench throw themselves on us. I begin to fire, and fire on them. I\nkill a terrible number; but they still continue to run straight at me.\nNow, it is impossible to fire any longer, and there is no hope for me;\nall at once my brother rushes out in front with his sword, and I grasp\nmy gun, and we rush on with the soldiers. The French throw themselves\non my brother. I hasten up; I kill one Frenchman, then another, and\nI save my brother. I am wounded in one arm; I seize my gun with the\nother, and continue my flight; but my brother is slain by my side by\nthe bullets. I halt for a moment, and gaze at him so sorrowfully; then\nI straighten myself up and shout: \'Follow me! We will avenge him! I\nloved my brother more than any one in the world,\' I shall say, \'and I\nhave lost him. Let us avenge him! Let us annihilate the foe, or let us\nall die together there!\' All shout, and fling themselves after me. Then\nthe whole French army makes a sortie, including even Pelissier himself.\nWe all fight; but, at last, I am wounded a second, a third time, and I\nfall, nearly dead. Then, all rush up to me. Gortchakoff comes up and\nasks what I would like. I say that I want nothing--except that I may\nbe laid beside my brother; that I wish to die with him. They carry\nme, and lay me down by the side of my brother\'s bloody corpse. Then I\nshall raise myself, and merely say: \'Yes, you did not understand how\nto value two men who really loved their father-land; now they have both\nfallen,--and may God forgive you!\' and I shall die.\n\nWho knows in what measure these dreams will be realized?\n\n"Have you ever been in a hand to hand fight?" he suddenly inquired of\nhis brother, quite forgetting that he had not meant to speak to him.\n\n"No, not once," answered the elder. "Our regiment has lost two thousand\nmen, all on the works; and I, also, was wounded there. War is not\ncarried on in the least as you fancy, Volodya."\n\nThe word "Volodya" touched the younger brother. He wanted to come to an\nexplanation with his brother, who had not the least idea that he had\noffended Volodya.\n\n"You are not angry with me, Misha?" he said, after a momentary silence.\n\n"What about?"\n\n"No, because--because we had such a--nothing."\n\n"Not in the least," replied the elder, turning to him, and slapping him\non the leg.\n\n"Then forgive me, Misha, if I have wounded you."\n\nAnd the younger brother turned aside, in order to hide the tears that\nsuddenly started to his eyes.\n\n\nVIII.\n\n"Is this Sevastopol already?" asked the younger brother, as they\nascended the hill.\n\nAnd before them appeared the bay, with its masts of ships, its\nshipping, and the sea, with the hostile fleet, in the distance; the\nwhite batteries on the shore, the barracks, the aqueducts, the docks\nand the buildings of the town, and the white and lilac clouds of smoke\nrising incessantly over the yellow hills, which surrounded the town and\nstood out against the blue sky, in the rosy rays of the sun, which was\nreflected by the waves, and sinking towards the horizon of the shadowy\nsea.\n\nVolodya, without a shudder, gazed upon this terrible place of which\nhe had thought so much; on the contrary, he did so with an aesthetic\nenjoyment, and a heroic sense of self-satisfaction at the idea that\nhere he was--he would be there in another half-hour, that he would\nbehold that really charmingly original spectacle--and he stared with\nconcentrated attention from that moment until they arrived at the north\nfortification, at the baggage-train of his brother\'s regiment, where\nthey were to ascertain with certainty the situations of the regiment\nand the battery.\n\nThe officer in charge of the train lived near the so-called new town\n(huts built of boards by the sailors\' families), in a tent, connecting\nwith a tolerably large shed, constructed out of green oak-boughs, that\nwere not yet entirely withered.\n\nThe brothers found the officer seated before a greasy table, upon which\nstood a glass of cold tea, a tray with vodka, crumbs of dry sturgeon\nroe, and bread, clad only in a shirt of a dirty yellow hue, and engaged\nin counting a huge pile of bank-bills on a large abacus.\n\nBut before describing the personality of the officer, and his\nconversation, it is indispensable that we should inspect with more\nattention the interior of his shed, and become a little acquainted, at\nleast, with his mode of life and his occupations. The new shed, like\nthose built for generals and regimental commanders, was large, closely\nwattled, and comfortably arranged, with little tables and benches, made\nof turf. The sides and roof were hung with three rugs, to keep the\nleaves from showering down, and, though extremely ugly, they were new,\nand certainly costly.\n\nUpon the iron bed, which stood beneath the principal rug, with a young\namazon depicted on it, lay a plush coverlet, of a brilliant crimson,\na torn and dirty pillow, and a raccoon cloak. On the table stood a\nmirror, in a silver frame, a silver brush, frightfully dirty, a broken\nhorn comb, full of greasy hair, a silver candlestick, a bottle of\nliqueur, with a huge gold and red label, a gold watch, with a portrait\nof Peter I., two gold pens, a small box, containing pills of some sort,\na crust of bread, and some old, castaway cards, and there were bottles,\nboth full and empty, under the bed.\n\nThis officer had charge of the commissariat of the regiment and the\nfodder of the horses. With him lived his great friend, the commissioner\nwho had charge of the operations.\n\nAt the moment when the brothers entered, the latter was asleep in\nthe booth, and the commissary officer was making up his accounts of\nthe government money, in anticipation of the end of the month. The\ncommissary officer had a very comely and warlike exterior. His stature\nwas tall, his moustache huge, and he possessed a respectable amount\nof plumpness. The only disagreeable points about him were a certain\nperspiration and puffiness of the whole face, which almost concealed\nhis small gray eyes (as though he was filled up with porter), and an\nexcessive lack of cleanliness, from his thin, greasy hair to his big,\nbare feet, thrust into some sort of ermine slippers.\n\n"Money, money!" said Kozeltzoff number one, entering the shed, and\nfixing his eyes, with involuntary greed, upon the pile of bank-notes.\n"You might lend me half of that, Vasily Mikhailitch!"\n\nThe commissary officer cringed at the sight of his visitors, and,\nsweeping up his money, he bowed to them without rising.\n\n"Oh, if it only belonged to me! It\'s government money, my dear fellow.\nAnd who is this you have with you?" said he, thrusting the money into a\ncoffer which stood beside him, and staring at Volodya.\n\n"This is my brother, who has just come from the military academy. We\nhave both come to learn from you where our regiment is stationed."\n\n"Sit down, gentlemen," said the officer, rising, and going into the\nshed, without paying any heed to his guests. "Won\'t you have something\nto drink? Some porter, for instance?" said he.\n\n"Don\'t put yourself out, Vasily Mikhailitch."\n\nVolodya was impressed by the size of the commissary officer, by his\ncarelessness of manner, and by the respect with which his brother\naddressed him.\n\n"It must be that this is one of their very fine officers, whom every\none respects. Really, he is simple, but hospitable and brave," he\nthought, seating himself in a timid and modest manner on the sofa.\n\n"Where is our regiment stationed, then?" called out his elder brother\ninto the board hut.\n\n"What?"\n\nHe repeated his query.\n\n"Zeifer has been here to-day. He told me that they had removed to the\nfifth bastion."\n\n"Is that true?"\n\n"If I say so, it must be true; but the deuce only knows anyway! He\nwould think nothing of telling a lie. Won\'t you have some porter?" said\nthe commissary officer, still from the tent.\n\n"I will if you please," said Kozeltzoff.\n\n"And will you have a drink, Osip Ignatievitch?" went on the voice in\nthe tent, apparently addressing the sleeping commissioner. "You have\nslept enough; it\'s five o\'clock."\n\n"Why do you worry me? I am not asleep," answered a shrill, languid\nlittle voice.\n\n"Come, get up! we find it stupid without you."\n\nAnd the commissary officer came out to his guests.\n\n"Fetch some Simferopol porter!" he shouted.\n\nA servant entered the booth, with a haughty expression of countenance,\nas it seemed to Volodya, and, having jostled Volodya, he drew forth the\nporter from beneath the bench.\n\nThe bottle of porter was soon emptied, and the conversation had\nproceeded in the same style for rather a long time when the flap of\nthe tent flew open and out stepped a short, fresh-colored man, in a\nblue dressing-gown with tassels, in a cap with a red rim and a cockade.\nAt the moment of his appearance, he was smoothing his small black\nmoustache, and, with his gaze fixed on the rugs, he replied to the\ngreetings of the officer with a barely perceptible movement of the\nshoulders.\n\n"I will drink a small glassful too!" said he, seating himself by the\ntable. "What is this, have you come from Petersburg, young man?" he\nsaid, turning courteously to Volodya.\n\n"Yes, sir, I am on my way to Sevastopol."\n\n"Did you make the application yourself?"\n\n"Yes, sir."\n\n"What queer tastes you have, gentlemen! I do not understand it!"\ncontinued the commissioner. "It strikes me that I should be ready just\nnow to travel on foot to Petersburg, if I could get away. By Heavens, I\nam tired of this cursed life!"\n\n"What is there about it that does not suit you?" said the elder\nKozeltzoff, turning to him. "You\'re the very last person to complain of\nlife here!"\n\nThe commissioner cast a look upon him, and then turned away.\n\n"This danger, these privations, it is impossible to get anything\nhere," he continued, addressing Volodya. "And why you should take\nsuch a freak, gentlemen, I really cannot understand. If there were any\nadvantages to be derived from it, but there is nothing of the sort. It\nwould be a nice thing, now, wouldn\'t it, if you, at your age, were to\nbe left a cripple for life!"\n\n"Some need the money, and some serve for honor\'s sake!" said the elder\nKozeltzoff, in a tone of vexation, joining the discussion once more.\n\n"What\'s the good of honor, when there\'s nothing to eat!" said the\ncommissioner with a scornful laugh, turning to the commissary, who also\nlaughed at this. "Give us something from \'Lucia\'; we will listen," he\nsaid, pointing to the music-box. "I love it."\n\n"Well, is that Vasily Mikhailitch a fine man?" Volodya asked his\nbrother when they emerged, at dusk, from the booth, and pursued their\nway to Sevastopol.\n\n"Not at all; but such a niggard that it is a perfect terror! And I\ncan\'t bear the sight of that commissioner, and I shall give him a\nthrashing one of these days."\n\n\nIX.\n\nVolodya was not precisely out of sorts when, nearly at nightfall,\nthey reached the great bridge over the bay, but he felt a certain\nheaviness at his heart. All that he had heard and seen was so little\nin consonance with the impressions which had recently passed away; the\nhuge, light examination hall, with its polished floor, the kind and\nmerry voices and laughter of his comrades, the new uniform, his beloved\ntsar, whom he had been accustomed to see for the last seven years, and\nwho, when he took leave of them, had called them his children, with\ntears in his eyes,--and everything that he had seen so little resembled\nhis very beautiful, rainbow-hued, magnificent dreams.\n\n"Well, here we are at last!" said the elder brother, when they arrived\nat the Mikhailovsky battery, and dismounted from their cart. "If\nthey let us pass the bridge, we will go directly to the Nikolaevsky\nbarracks. You stay there until morning, and I will go to the regiment\nand find out where your battery is stationed, and to-morrow I will come\nfor you."\n\n"But why? It would be better if we both went together," said Volodya;\n"I will go to the bastion with you. It won\'t make any difference; I\nshall have to get used to it. If you go, then I can too."\n\n"Better not go."\n\n"No, if you please; I do know, at least, that...."\n\n"My advice is, not to go; but if you choose...."\n\nThe sky was clear and dark; the stars, and the fires of the bombs\nin incessant movement and discharges, were gleaming brilliantly\nthrough the gloom. The large white building of the battery, and the\nbeginning of the bridge stood out in the darkness. Literally, every\nsecond several discharges of artillery and explosions, following each\nother in quick succession or occurring simultaneously, shook the air\nwith increasing thunder and distinctness. Through this roar, and as\nthough repeating it, the melancholy dash of the waves was audible. A\nfaint breeze was drawing in from the sea, and the air was heavy with\nmoisture. The brothers stepped upon the bridge. A soldier struck his\ngun awkwardly against his arm, and shouted:--\n\n"Who goes there?"\n\n"A soldier."\n\n"The orders are not to let any one pass!"\n\n"What of that! We have business! We must pass!"\n\n"Ask the officer."\n\nThe officer, who was drowsing as he sat on an anchor, rose up and gave\nthe order to let them pass.\n\n"You can go that way, but not this. Where are you driving to, all in a\nheap!" he cried to the transport wagons piled high with gabions, which\nhad clustered about the entrance.\n\nAs they descended to the first pontoon, the brothers encountered\nsoldiers who were coming thence, and talking loudly.\n\n"If he has received his ammunition money, then he has squared his\naccounts in full--that\'s what it is!"\n\n"Eh, brothers!" said another voice, "when you get over on the\nSevernaya you will see the world, by heavens! The air is entirely\ndifferent."\n\n"You may say more!" said the first speaker. "A cursed shell flew in\nthere the other day, and it tore the legs off of two sailors, so\nthat...."\n\nThe brothers traversed the first pontoon, while waiting for the wagon,\nand halted on the second, which was already flooded with water in\nparts. The breeze, which had seemed weak inland, was very powerful\nhere, and came in gusts; the bridge swayed to and fro, and the waves,\nbeating noisily against the beams, and tearing at the cables and\nanchors, flooded the planks. At the right the gloomily hostile sea\nroared and darkled, as it lay separated by an interminable level black\nline from the starry horizon, which was light gray in its gleam; lights\nflashed afar on the enemy\'s fleet; on the left towered the black\nmasts of one of our vessels, and the waves could be heard as they\nbeat against her hull; a steamer was visible, as it moved noisily and\nswiftly from the Severnaya.\n\nThe flash of a bomb, as it burst near it, illuminated for a moment\nthe lofty heaps of gabions on the deck, two men who were standing\non it, and the white foam and the spurts of greenish waves, as the\nsteamer ploughed through them. On the edge of the bridge, with his\nlegs dangling in the water, sat a man in his shirt-sleeves, who\nwas repairing something connected with the bridge. In front, over\nSevastopol, floated the same fires, and the terrible sounds grew louder\nand louder. A wave rolled in from the sea, flowed over the right side\nof the bridge, and wet Volodya\'s feet; two soldiers passed them,\ndragging their feet through the water. Something suddenly burst with a\ncrash and lighted up the bridge ahead of them, the wagon driving over\nit, and a man on horseback. The splinters fell into the waves with a\nhiss, and sent up the water in splashes.\n\n"Ah, Mikhailo Semyonitch!" said the rider, stopping, reining in his\nhorse in front of the elder Kozeltzoff, "have you fully recovered\nalready?"\n\n"As you see. Whither is God taking you?"\n\n"To the Severnaya, for cartridges; I am on my way to the adjutant of\nthe regiment ... we expect an assault to-morrow, at any hour."\n\n"And where is Martzoff?"\n\n"He lost a leg yesterday; he was in the town, asleep in his room....\nPerhaps you know it?"\n\n"The regiment is in the fifth bastion, isn\'t it?"\n\n"Yes; it has taken the place of the M---- regiment. Go to the\nfield-hospital; some of our men are there, and they will show you the\nway."\n\n"Well, and are my quarters on the Morskaya still intact?"\n\n"Why, my good fellow, they were smashed to bits long ago by the bombs.\nYou will not recognize Sevastopol now; there\'s not a single woman there\nnow, nor any inns nor music; the last establishment took its departure\nyesterday. It has become horribly dismal there now.... Farewell!"\n\nAnd the officer rode on his way at a trot.\n\nAll at once, Volodya became terribly frightened; it seemed to him\nas though a cannon-ball or a splinter of bomb would fly in their\ndirection, and strike him directly on the head. This damp darkness,\nall these sounds, especially the angry splashing of the waves, seemed\nto be saying to him that he ought not to go any farther, that nothing\ngood awaited him yonder, that he would never again set foot on the\nground upon this side of the bay, that he must turn about at once, and\nflee somewhere or other, as far as possible from this terrible haunt\nof death. "But perhaps it is too late now, everything is settled,"\nthought he, trembling partly at this thought and partly because the\nwater had soaked through his boots and wet his feet.\n\nVolodya heaved a deep sigh, and went a little apart from his brother.\n\n"Lord, will they kill me--me in particular? Lord, have mercy on me!"\nsaid he, in a whisper, and he crossed himself.\n\n"Come, Volodya, let us go on!" said the elder brother, when their\nlittle cart had driven upon the bridge. "Did you see that bomb?"\n\nOn the bridge, the brothers met wagons filled with the wounded, with\ngabions, and one loaded with furniture, which was driven by a woman. On\nthe further side no one detained them.\n\nClinging instinctively to the walls of the Nikolaevsky battery, the\nbrothers listened in silence to the noise of the bombs, exploding\noverhead, and to the roar of the fragments, showering down from above,\nand came to that spot in the battery where the image was. There they\nlearned that the fifth light battery, to which Volodya had been\nassigned, was stationed on the Korabelnaya, and they decided that he\nshould go, in spite of the danger, and pass the night with the elder\nin the fifth bastion, and that he should from there join his battery\nthe next day. They turned into the corridor, stepping over the legs\nof the sleeping soldiers, who were lying all along the walls of the\nbattery, and at last they arrived at the place where the wounded were\nattended to.\n\n\nX.\n\nAs they entered the first room, surrounded with cots on which lay the\nwounded, and permeated with that frightful and disgusting hospital\nodor, they met two Sisters of Mercy, who were coming to meet them.\n\nOne woman, of fifty, with black eyes, and a stern expression of\ncountenance, was carrying bandages and lint, and was giving strict\norders to a young fellow, an assistant surgeon, who was following her;\nthe other, a very pretty girl of twenty, with a pale and delicate\nlittle fair face, gazed in an amiably helpless way from beneath her\nwhite cap, held her hands in the pockets of her apron, as she walked\nbeside the elder woman, and seemed to be afraid to quit her side.\n\nKozeltzoff addressed to them the question whether they knew where\nMartzoff was--the man whose leg had been torn off on the day before.\n\n"He belonged to the P---- regiment, did he not?" inquired the elder. "Is\nhe a relative of yours?"\n\n"No, a comrade."\n\n"Show them the way," said she, in French, to the young sister. "Here,\nthis way," and she approached a wounded man, in company with the\nassistant.\n\n"Come along; what are you staring at?" said Kozeltzoff to Volodya,\nwho, with uplifted eyebrows and somewhat suffering expression of\ncountenance, could not tear himself away, but continued to stare at the\nwounded. "Come, let us go."\n\nVolodya went off with his brother, still continuing to gaze about him,\nhowever, and repeating unconsciously:--\n\n"Ah, my God! Ah, my God!"\n\n"He has probably not been here long?" inquired the sister of\nKozeltzoff, pointing at Volodya, who, groaning and sighing, followed\nthem through the corridor.\n\n"He has but just arrived."\n\nThe pretty little sister glanced at Volodya, and suddenly burst out\ncrying. "My God! my God! when will there be an end to all this?"\nshe said, with the accents of despair. They entered the officer\'s\nhut. Martzoff was lying on his back, with his muscular arms, bare\nto the elbow, thrown over his head, and with the expression on his\nyellow face of a man who is clenching his teeth in order to keep from\nshrieking with pain. His whole leg, in its stocking, was thrust outside\nthe coverlet, and it could be seen how he was twitching his toes\nconvulsively inside it.\n\n"Well, how goes it, how do you feel?" asked the sister, raising his\nbald head with her slender, delicate fingers, on one of which Volodya\nnoticed a gold ring, and arranging his pillow. "Here are some of your\ncomrades come to inquire after you."\n\n"Badly, of course," he answered, angrily. "Let me alone! it\'s all\nright,"--the toes in his stocking moved more rapidly than ever.\n"How do you do? What is your name? Excuse me," he said, turning to\nKozeltzoff.... "Ah, yes, I beg your pardon! one forgets everything\nhere," he said, when the latter had mentioned his name. "You and\nI lived together," he added, without the slightest expression of\npleasure, glancing interrogatively at Volodya.\n\n"This is my brother, who has just arrived from Petersburg to-day."\n\n"Hm! Here I have finished my service," he said, with a frown. "Ah, how\npainful it is!... The best thing would be a speedy end."\n\nHe drew up his leg, and covered his face with his hands, continuing to\nmove his toes with redoubled swiftness.\n\n"You must leave him," said the sister, in a whisper, while the tears\nstood in her eyes; "he is in a very bad state."\n\nThe brothers had already decided on the north side to go to the fifth\nbastion; but, on emerging from the Nikolaevsky battery, they seemed\nto have come to a tacit understanding not to subject themselves\nto unnecessary danger, and, without discussing the subject, they\ndetermined to go their ways separately.\n\n"Only, how are you to find your way, Volodya?" said the elder.\n"However, Nikolaeff will conduct you to the Korabelnaya, and I will go\nmy way alone, and will be with you to-morrow."\n\nNothing more was said at this last leave-taking between the brothers.\n\n\nXI.\n\nThe thunder of the cannon continued with the same power as before, but\nYekaterinskaya street, along which Volodya walked, followed by the\ntaciturn Nikolaeff, was quiet and deserted. All that he could see,\nthrough the thick darkness, was the wide street with the white walls of\nlarge houses, battered in many places, and the stone sidewalk beneath\nhis feet; now and then, he met soldiers and officers. As he passed\nalong the left side of the street, near the Admiralty building, he\nperceived, by the light of a bright fire burning behind the wall, the\nacacias planted along the sidewalk, with green guards beneath, and the\nwretchedly dusty leaves of these acacias.\n\nHe could plainly hear his own steps and those of Nikolaeff, who\nfollowed him, breathing heavily. He thought of nothing; the pretty\nlittle Sister of Mercy, Martzoff\'s leg with the toes twitching in its\nstocking, the bombs, the darkness, and divers pictures of death floated\nhazily through his mind. All his young and sensitive soul shrank\ntogether, and was borne down by his consciousness of loneliness, and\nthe indifference of every one to his fate in the midst of danger.\n\n"They will kill me, I shall be tortured, I shall suffer, and no one\nwill weep." And all this, instead of the hero\'s life, filled with\nenergy and sympathy, of which he had cherished such glorious dreams.\nThe bombs burst and shrieked nearer and ever nearer. Nikolaeff sighed\nmore frequently, without breaking the silence. On crossing the bridge\nleading to the Korabelnaya, he saw something fly screaming into the\nbay, not far from him, which lighted up the lilac waves for an instant\nwith a crimson glow, then disappeared, and threw on high a cloud of\nfoam.\n\n"See there, it was not put out!" said Nikolaeff, hoarsely.\n\n"Yes," answered Volodya, involuntarily, and quite unexpectedly to\nhimself, in a thin, piping voice.\n\nThey encountered litters with wounded men, then more regimental\ntransports with gabions; they met a regiment on Korabelnaya street;\nmen on horseback passed them. One of them was an officer, with his\nCossack. He was riding at a trot, but, on catching sight of Volodya, he\nreined in his horse near him, looked into his face, turned and rode on,\ngiving the horse a blow of his whip.\n\n"Alone, alone; it is nothing to any one whether I am in existence or\nnot," thought the lad, and he felt seriously inclined to cry.\n\nAfter ascending the hill, past a high white wall, he entered a street\nof small ruined houses, incessantly illuminated by bombs. A drunken and\ndishevelled woman, who was coming out of a small door in company with a\nsailor, ran against him.\n\n"If he were only a fine man," she grumbled,--"Pardon, Your Honor the\nofficer."\n\nThe poor boy\'s heart sank lower and lower, and more and more frequently\nflashed the lightnings against the dark horizon, and the bombs\nscreamed and burst about him with ever increasing frequency. Nikolaeff\nsighed, and all at once he began to speak, in what seemed to Volodya a\nfrightened and constrained tone.\n\n"What haste we made to get here from home. It was nothing but\ntravelling. A pretty place to be in a hurry to get to!"\n\n"What was to be done, if my brother was well again," replied Volodya,\nin hope that he might banish by conversation the frightful feeling that\nwas taking possession of him.\n\n"Well, what sort of health is it when he is thoroughly ill! Those who\nare really well had better stay in the hospital at such a time. A\nvast deal of joy there is about it, isn\'t there? You will have a leg\nor an arm torn off, and that\'s all you will get! It\'s not far removed\nfrom a downright sin! And here in the town it\'s not at all like the\nbastion, and that is a perfect terror. You go and you say your prayers\nthe whole way. Eh, you beast, there you go whizzing past!" he added,\ndirecting his attention to the sound of a splinter of shell whizzing\nby near them. "Now, here," Nikolaeff went on, "I was ordered to show\nYour Honor the way. My business, of course, is to do as I am bid; but\nthe cart has been abandoned to some wretch of a soldier, and the bundle\nis undone.... Go on and on; but if any of the property disappears,\nNikolaeff will have to answer for it."\n\nAfter proceeding a few steps further, they came out on a square.\nNikolaeff held his peace, but sighed.\n\n"Yonder is your artillery, Your Honor!" he suddenly said. "Ask the\nsentinel; he will show you."\n\nAnd Volodya, after he had taken a few steps more, ceased to hear the\nsound of Nikolaeff\'s sighs behind him.\n\nAll at once, he felt himself entirely and finally alone. This\nconsciousness of solitude in danger, before death, as it seemed to him,\nlay upon his heart like a terribly cold and heavy stone.\n\nHe halted in the middle of the square, glanced about him, to see\nwhether he could catch sight of any one, grasped his head, and uttered\nhis thought aloud in his terror:--"Lord! Can it be that I am a coward,\na vile, disgusting, worthless coward ... can it be that I so lately\ndreamed of dying with joy for my father-land, my tsar? No, I am a\nwretched, an unfortunate, a wretched being!" And Volodya, with a\ngenuine sentiment of despair and disenchantment with himself, inquired\nof the sentinel for the house of the commander of the battery, and set\nout in the direction indicated.\n\n\nXII.\n\nThe residence of the commander of the battery, which the sentinel had\npointed out to him, was a small, two-story house, with an entrance\non the court-yard. In one of the windows, which was pasted over with\npaper, burned the feeble flame of a candle. A servant was seated on\nthe porch, smoking his pipe; he went in and announced Volodya to the\ncommander, and then led him in. In the room, between the two windows,\nand beneath a shattered mirror, stood a table, heaped with official\ndocuments, several chairs, and an iron bedstead, with a clean pallet,\nand a small bed-rug by its side.\n\nNear the door stood a handsome man, with a large moustache,--a sergeant,\nin sabre and cloak, on the latter of which hung a cross and a Hungarian\nmedal. Back and forth in the middle of the room paced a short\nstaff-officer of forty, with swollen cheeks bound up, and dressed in a\nthin old coat.\n\n"I have the honor to report myself, Cornet Kozeltzoff, 2d, ordered to\nthe fifth light battery," said Volodya, uttering the phrase which he\nhad learned by heart, as he entered the room.\n\nThe commander of the battery responded dryly to his greeting, and,\nwithout offering his hand, invited him to be seated.\n\nVolodya dropped timidly into a chair, beside the writing-table, and\nbegan to twist in his fingers the scissors, which his hand happened\nto light upon. The commander of the battery put his hands behind his\nback, and, dropping his head, pursued his walk up and down the room, in\nsilence, only bestowing an occasional glance at the hands which were\ntwirling the scissors, with the aspect of a man who is trying to recall\nsomething.\n\nThe battery commander was a rather stout man, with a large bald spot\non the crown of his head, a thick moustache, which drooped straight\ndown and concealed his mouth, and pleasant brown eyes. His hands were\nhandsome, clean, and plump; his feet small and well turned, and they\nstepped out in a confident and rather dandified manner, proving that\nthe commander was not a timid man.\n\n"Yes," he said, coming to a halt in front of the sergeant; "a measure\nmust be added to the grain to-morrow, or our horses will be getting\nthin. What do you think?"\n\n"Of course, it is possible to do so, Your Excellency! Oats are very\ncheap just now," replied the sergeant, twitching his fingers, which\nhe held on the seams of his trousers, but which evidently liked to\nassist in the conversation. "Our forage-master, Franchuk, sent me a\nnote yesterday, from the transports, Your Excellency, saying that we\nshould certainly be obliged to purchase oats; they say they are cheap.\nTherefore, what are your orders?"\n\n"To buy, of course. He has money, surely." And the commander resumed\nhis tramp through the room. "And where are your things?" he suddenly\ninquired of Volodya, as he paused in front of him.\n\nPoor Volodya was so overwhelmed by the thought that he was a coward,\nthat he espied scorn for himself in every glance, in every word, as\nthough they had been addressed to a pitiable poltroon. It seemed to him\nthat the commander of the battery had already divined his secret, and\nwas making sport of him. He answered, with embarrassment, that his\neffects were on the Grafskaya, and that his brother had promised to\nsend them to him on the morrow.\n\nBut the lieutenant-colonel was not listening to him, and, turning to\nthe sergeant, he inquired:--\n\n"Where are we to put the ensign?"\n\n"The ensign, sir?" said the sergeant, throwing Volodya into still\ngreater confusion by the fleeting glance which he cast upon him, and\nwhich seemed to say, "What sort of an ensign is this?"--"He can be\nquartered downstairs, with the staff-captain, Your Excellency," he\ncontinued, after a little reflection. "The captain is at the bastion\njust now, and his cot is empty."\n\n"Will that not suit you, temporarily?" said the commander.--"I think you\nmust be tired, but we will lodge you better to-morrow."\n\nVolodya rose and bowed.\n\n"Will you not have some tea?" said the commander, when he had already\nreached the door. "The samovar can be brought in."\n\nVolodya saluted and left the room. The lieutenant-colonel\'s servant\nconducted him downstairs, and led him into a bare, dirty chamber, in\nwhich various sorts of rubbish were lying about, and where there was\nan iron bedstead without either sheets or coverlet. A man in a red\nshirt was fast asleep on the bed, covered over with a thick cloak.\n\nVolodya took him for a soldier.\n\n"Piotr Nikolaitch!" said the servant, touching the sleeper on the\nshoulder. "The ensign is to sleep here.... This is our yunker," he\nadded, turning to the ensign.\n\n"Ah, don\'t trouble him, please," said Volodya; but the yunker, a tall,\nstout, young man, with a handsome but very stupid face, rose from the\nbed, threw on his cloak, and, evidently not having had a good sleep,\nleft the room.\n\n"No matter; I\'ll lie down in the yard," he growled out.\n\n\nXIII.\n\nLeft alone with his own thoughts, Volodya\'s first sensation was a fear\nof the incoherent, forlorn state of his own soul. He wanted to go to\nsleep, and forget all his surroundings, and himself most of all. He\nextinguished the candle, lay down on the bed, and, taking off his coat,\nhe wrapped his head up in it, in order to relieve his terror of the\ndarkness, with which he had been afflicted since his childhood. But all\nat once the thought occurred to him that a bomb might come and crush\nin the roof and kill him. He began to listen attentively; directly\noverhead, he heard the footsteps of the battery commander.\n\n"Anyway, if it does come," he thought, "it will kill any one who is\nupstairs first, and then me; at all events, I shall not be the only\none."\n\nThis thought calmed him somewhat.\n\n"Well, and what if Sevastopol should be taken unexpectedly, in the\nnight, and the French make their way hither? What am I to defend myself\nwith?"\n\nHe rose once more, and began to pace the room. His terror of the actual\ndanger outweighed his secret fear of the darkness. There was nothing\nheavy in the room except the samovar and a saddle. "I am a scoundrel, a\ncoward, a miserable coward!" the thought suddenly occurred to him, and\nagain he experienced that oppressive sensation of scorn and disgust,\neven for himself. Again he threw himself on the bed, and tried not to\nthink.\n\nThen the impressions of the day involuntarily penetrated his\nimagination, in consequence of the unceasing sounds, which made the\nglass in the solitary window rattle, and again the thought of danger\nrecurred to him: now he saw visions of wounded men and blood, now\nof bombs and splinters, flying into the room, then of the pretty\nlittle Sister of Mercy, who was applying a bandage to him, a dying\nman, and weeping over him, then of his mother, accompanying him to\nthe provincial town, and praying, amid burning tears, before the\nwonder-working images, and once more sleep appeared an impossibility to\nhim.\n\nBut suddenly the thought of Almighty God, who can do all things, and\nwho hears every supplication, came clearly into his mind. He knelt\ndown, crossed himself, and folded his hands as he had been taught to do\nin his childhood, when he prayed. This gesture, all at once, brought\nback to him a consoling feeling, which he had long since forgotten.\n\n"If I must die, if I must cease to exist, \'thy will be done, Lord,\'"\nhe thought; "let it be quickly; but if bravery is needed, and the\nfirmness which I do not possess, give them to me; deliver me from shame\nand disgrace, which I cannot bear, but teach me what to do in order to\nfulfil thy will."\n\nHis childish, frightened, narrow soul was suddenly encouraged; it\ncleared up, and caught sight of broad, brilliant, and new horizons.\nDuring the brief period while this feeling lasted, he felt and thought\nmany other things, and soon fell asleep quietly and unconcernedly, to\nthe continuous sounds of the roar of the bombardment and the rattling\nof the window-panes.\n\nGreat Lord! thou alone hast heard, and thou alone knowest those ardent,\ndespairing prayers of ignorance, of troubled repentance, those\npetitions for the healing of the body and the enlightenment of the\nmind, which have ascended to thee from that terrible precinct of death,\nfrom the general who, a moment before, was thinking of his cross of the\nGeorge on his neck, and conscious in his terror of thy near presence,\nto the simple soldier writhing on the bare earth of the Nikolaevsky\nbattery, and beseeching thee to bestow upon him there the reward,\nunconsciously presaged, for all his sufferings.\n\n\nXIV.\n\nThe elder Kozeltzoff, meeting on the street a soldier belonging to his\nregiment, betook himself at once, in company with the man, to the fifth\nbastion.\n\n"Keep under the wall, Your Honor," said the soldier.\n\n"What for?"\n\n"It\'s dangerous, Your Honor; there\'s one passing over," said the\nsoldier, listening to the sound of a screaming cannon-ball, which\nstruck the dry road, on the other side of the street.\n\nKozeltzoff, paying no heed to the soldier, walked bravely along the\nmiddle of the street.\n\nThese were the same streets, the same fires, even more frequent now,\nthe sounds, the groans, the encounters with the wounded, and the same\nbatteries, breastworks, and trenches, which had been there in the\nspring, when he was last in Sevastopol; but, for some reason, all this\nwas now more melancholy, and, at the same time, more energetic, the\napertures in the houses were larger, there were no longer any lights in\nthe windows, with the exception of the Kushtchin house (the hospital),\nnot a woman was to be met with, the earlier tone of custom and freedom\nfrom care no longer rested over all, but, instead, a certain impress of\nheavy expectation, of weariness and earnestness.\n\nBut here is the last trench already, and here is the voice of a soldier\nof the P---- regiment, who has recognized the former commander of his\ncompany, and here stands the third battalion in the gloom, clinging\nclose to the wall, and lighted up now and then, for a moment, by the\ndischarges, and a sound of subdued conversation, and the rattling of\nguns.\n\n"Where is the commander of the regiment?" inquired Kozeltzoff.\n\n"In the bomb-proofs with the sailors, Your Honor," replied the soldier,\nready to be of service. "I will show you the way, if you like."\n\nFrom trench to trench the soldier led Kozeltzoff, to the small ditch in\nthe trench. In the ditch sat a sailor, smoking his pipe; behind him a\ndoor was visible, through whose cracks shone a light.\n\n"Can I enter?"\n\n"I will announce you at once," and the sailor went in through the door.\n\nTwo voices became audible on the other side of the door.\n\n"If Prussia continues to observe neutrality," said one voice, "then\nAustria also...."\n\n"What difference does Austria make," said the second, "when the Slavic\nlands ... well, ask him to come in."\n\nKozeltzoff had never been in this casemate. He was struck by its\nelegance. The floor was of polished wood, screens shielded the door.\nTwo bedsteads stood against the wall, in one corner stood a large\nikon of the mother of God, in a gilt frame, and before her burned a\nrose-colored lamp.\n\nOn one of the beds, a naval officer, fully dressed, was sleeping. On\nthe other, by a table upon which stood two bottles of wine, partly\nempty, sat the men who were talking--the new regimental commander and\nhis adjutant.\n\nAlthough Kozeltzoff was far from being a coward, and was certainly\nnot guilty of any wrongdoing so far as his superior officers were\nconcerned, nor towards the regimental commander, yet he felt timid\nbefore the colonel, who had been his comrade not long before, so\nproudly did this colonel rise and listen to him.\n\n"It is strange," thought Kozeltzoff, as he surveyed his commander, "it\nis only seven weeks since he took the regiment, and how visible already\nis his power as regimental commander, in everything about him--in his\ndress, his bearing, his look. Is it so very long," thought he, "since\nthis Batrishtcheff used to carouse with us, and he wore a cheap cotton\nshirt, and ate by himself, never inviting any one to his quarters, his\neternal meat-balls and curd-patties? But now! and that expression of\ncold pride in his eyes, which says to you, \'Though I am your comrade,\nbecause I am a regimental commander of the new school, yet, believe me,\nI am well aware that you would give half your life merely for the sake\nof being in my place!\'"\n\n"You have been a long time in recovering," said the colonel to\nKozeltzoff, coldly, with a stare.\n\n"I was ill, colonel! The wound has not closed well even now."\n\n"Then there was no use in your coming," said the colonel, casting\nan incredulous glance at the captain\'s stout figure. "You are,\nnevertheless, in a condition to fulfil your duty?"\n\n"Certainly I am, sir."\n\n"Well I\'m very glad of that, sir. You will take the ninth company from\nEnsign Zaitzoff--the one you had before; you will receive your orders\nimmediately."\n\n"I obey, sir."\n\n"Take care to send me the regimental adjutant when you arrive," said\nthe regimental commander, giving him to understand, by a slight nod,\nthat his audience was at an end.\n\nOn emerging from the casemate, Kozeltzoff muttered something several\ntimes, and shrugged his shoulders, as though pained, embarrassed,\nor vexed at something, and vexed, not at the regimental commander\n(there was no cause for that), but at himself, and he appeared to be\ndissatisfied with himself and with everything about him.\n\n\nXV.\n\nBefore going to his officers, Kozeltzoff went to greet his company, and\nto see where it was stationed.\n\nThe breastwork of gabions, the shapes of the trenches, the cannons\nwhich he passed, even the fragments of shot, bombs, over which he\nstumbled in his path--all this, incessantly illuminated by the light\nof the firing, was well known to him, all this had engraved itself\nin vivid colors on his memory, three months before, during the two\nweeks which he had spent in this very bastion, without once leaving\nit. Although there was much that was terrible in these reminiscences,\na certain charm of past things was mingled with it, and he recognized\nthe familiar places and objects with pleasure, as though the two weeks\nspent there had been agreeable ones. The company was stationed along\nthe defensive wall toward the sixth bastion.\n\nKozeltzoff entered the long casemate, utterly unprotected at the\nentrance side, in which they had told him that the ninth company\nwas stationed. There was, literally, no room to set his foot in the\ncasemate, so filled was it, from the very entrance, with soldiers. On\none side burned a crooked tallow candle, which a recumbent soldier\nwas holding to illuminate the book which another one was spelling\nout slowly. Around the candle, in the reeking half-light, heads were\nvisible, eagerly raised in strained attention to the reader. The little\nbook in question was a primer. As Kozeltzoff entered the casemate, he\nheard the following:\n\n"Pray-er af-ter lear-ning. I thank Thee, Crea-tor ..."\n\n"Snuff that candle!" said a voice. "That\'s a splendid book." "My ...\nGod ..." went on the reader.\n\nWhen Kozeltzoff asked for the sergeant, the reader stopped, the\nsoldiers began to move about, coughed, and blew their noses, as they\nalways do after enforced silence. The sergeant rose near the group\nabout the reader, buttoning up his coat as he did so, and stepping over\nand on the feet of those who had no room to withdraw them, and came\nforward to his officer.\n\n"How are you, brother? Do all these belong to our company?"\n\n"I wish you health! Welcome on your return, Your Honor!" replied the\nsergeant, with a cheerful and friendly look at Kozeltzoff. "Has Your\nHonor recovered your health? Well, God be praised. It has been very\ndull for us without you."\n\nIt was immediately apparent that Kozeltzoff was beloved in the company.\n\nIn the depths of the casemate, voices could be heard. Their old\ncommander, who had been wounded, Mikhail Semyonitch Kozeltzoff,\nhad arrived, and so forth; some even approached, and the drummer\ncongratulated him.\n\n"How are you, Obantchuk?" said Kozeltzoff. "Are you all right?\nGood-day, children!" he said, raising his voice.\n\n"We wish you health!" sounded through the casemate.\n\n"How are you getting on, children?"\n\n"Badly, Your Honor. The French are getting the better of us.--Fighting\nfrom behind the fortifications is bad work, and that\'s all there is\nabout it! and they won\'t come out into the open field."\n\n"Perhaps luck is with me, and God will grant that they shall come out\ninto the field, children!" said Kozeltzoff. "It won\'t be the first time\nthat you and I have taken a hand together: we\'ll beat them again."\n\n"We\'ll be glad to try it, Your Honor!" exclaimed several voices.\n\n"And how about them--are they really bold?"\n\n"Frightfully bold!" said the drummer, not loudly, but so that his words\nwere audible, turning to another soldier, as though justifying before\nhim the words of the commander, and persuading him that there was\nnothing boastful or improbable in these words.\n\nFrom the soldiers, Kozeltzoff proceeded to the defensive barracks and\nhis brother officers.\n\n\nXVI.\n\nIn the large room of the barracks there was a great number of men;\nnaval, artillery, and infantry officers. Some were sleeping, others\nwere conversing, seated on the shot-chests and gun-carriages of the\ncannons of the fortifications; others still, who formed a very numerous\nand noisy group behind the arch, were seated upon two felt rugs, which\nhad been spread on the floor, and were drinking porter and playing\ncards.\n\n"Ah! Kozeltzoff, Kozeltzoff! Capital! it\'s a good thing that he has\ncome! He\'s a brave fellow!... How\'s your wound?" rang out from various\nquarters. Here also it was evident that they loved him and were\nrejoiced at his coming.\n\nAfter shaking hands with his friends, Kozeltzoff joined the noisy\ngroup of officers engaged in playing cards. There were some of his\nacquaintances among them. A slender, handsome, dark-complexioned man,\nwith a long, sharp nose and a huge moustache, which began on his\ncheeks, was dealing the cards with his thin, white, taper fingers,\non one of which there was a heavy gold seal ring. He was dealing\nstraight on, and carelessly, being evidently excited by something,--and\nmerely desirous of making a show of heedlessness. On his right, and\nbeside him, lay a gray-haired major, supporting himself on his elbow,\nand playing for half a ruble with affected coolness, and settling up\nimmediately. On his left squatted an officer with a red, perspiring\nface, who was laughing and jesting in a constrained way. When his\ncards won, he moved one hand about incessantly in his empty trousers\npocket. He was playing high, and evidently no longer for ready money,\nwhich displeased the handsome, dark-complexioned man. A thin and pallid\nofficer with a bald head, and a huge nose and mouth, was walking about\nthe room, holding a large package of bank-notes in his hand, staking\nready money on the bank, and winning.\n\nKozeltzoff took a drink of vodka, and sat down by the players.\n\n"Take a hand, Mikhail Semyonitch!" said the dealer to him; "you have\nbrought lots of money, I suppose."\n\n"Where should I get any money! On the contrary, I got rid of the last I\nhad in town."\n\n"The idea! Some one certainly must have fleeced you in Simpferopol."\n\n"I really have but very little," said Kozeltzoff, but he was evidently\ndesirous that they should not believe him; then he unbuttoned his coat,\nand took the old cards in his hand.\n\n"I don\'t care if I do try; there\'s no knowing what the Evil One will\ndo! queer things do come about at times. But I must have a drink, to\nget up my courage."\n\nAnd within a very short space of time he had drunk another glass of\nvodka and several of porter, and had lost his last three rubles.\n\nA hundred and fifty rubles were written down against the little,\nperspiring officer.\n\n"No, he will not bring them," said he, carelessly, drawing a fresh card.\n\n"Try to send it," said the dealer to him, pausing a moment in his\noccupation of laying out the cards, and glancing at him.\n\n"Permit me to send it to-morrow," repeated the perspiring officer,\nrising, and moving his hand about vigorously in his empty pocket.\n\n"Hm!" growled the dealer, and, throwing the cards angrily to the right\nand left, he completed the deal. "But this won\'t do," said he, when he\nhad dealt the cards. "I\'m going to stop. It won\'t do, Zakhar Ivanitch,"\nhe added, "we have been playing for ready money and not on credit."\n\n"What, do you doubt me? That\'s strange, truly!"\n\n"From whom is one to get anything?" muttered the major, who had won\nabout eight rubles. "I have lost over twenty rubles, but when I have\nwon--I get nothing."\n\n"How am I to pay," said the dealer, "when there is no money on the\ntable?"\n\n"I won\'t listen to you!" shouted the major, jumping up, "I am playing\nwith you, but not with him."\n\nAll at once the perspiring officer flew into a rage.\n\n"I tell you that I will pay to-morrow; how dare you say such\nimpertinent things to me?"\n\n"I shall say what I please! This is not the way to do--that\'s the\ntruth!" shouted the major.\n\n"That will do, Feodor Feodoritch!" all chimed in, holding back the\nmajor.\n\nBut let us draw a veil over this scene. To-morrow, to-day, it may be,\neach one of these men will go cheerfully and proudly to meet his death,\nand he will die with firmness and composure; but the one consolation of\nlife in these conditions, which terrify even the coldest imagination in\nthe absence of all that is human, and the hopelessness of any escape\nfrom them, the one consolation is forgetfulness, the annihilation\nof consciousness. At the bottom of the soul of each lies that noble\nspark, which makes of him a hero; but this spark wearies of burning\nclearly--when the fateful moment comes it flashes up into a flame, and\nilluminates great deeds.\n\n\nXVII.\n\nOn the following day, the bombardment proceeded with the same vigor.\nAt eleven o\'clock in the morning, Volodya Kozeltzoff was seated in\na circle of battery officers, and, having already succeeded to some\nextent in habituating himself to them, he was surveying the new faces,\ntaking observations, making inquiries, and telling stories.\n\nThe discreet conversation of the artillery officers, which made some\npretensions to learning, pleased him and inspired him with respect.\nVolodya\'s shy, innocent, and handsome appearance disposed the officers\nin his favor.\n\nThe eldest officer in the battery, the captain, a short,\nsandy-complexioned man, with his hair arranged in a topknot, and smooth\non the temples, educated in the old traditions of the artillery, a\nsquire of dames, and a would-be learned man, questioned Volodya as to\nhis acquirements in artillery and new inventions, jested caressingly\nover his youth and his pretty little face, and treated him, in\ngeneral, as a father treats a son, which was extremely agreeable to\nVolodya.\n\nSub-Lieutenant Dyadenko, a young officer, who talked with a Little\nRussian accent, had a tattered cloak and dishevelled hair, although\nhe talked very loudly, and constantly seized opportunities to dispute\nacrimoniously over some topic, and was very abrupt in his movements,\npleased Volodya, who, beneath this rough exterior, could not help\ndetecting in him a very fine and extremely good man. Dyadenko was\nincessantly offering his services to Volodya, and pointing out to him\nthat not one of the guns in Sevastopol was properly placed, according\nto rule.\n\nLieutenant Tchernovitzky, with his brows elevated on high, though he\nwas more courteous than any of the rest, and dressed in a coat that\nwas tolerably clean, but not new, and carefully patched, and though\nhe displayed a gold watch-chain on a satin waistcoat, did not please\nVolodya. He kept inquiring what the Emperor and the minister of war\nwere doing, and related to him, with unnatural triumph, the deeds of\nvalor which had been performed in Sevastopol, complained of the small\nnumber of true patriots, and displayed a great deal of learning, and\nsense, and noble feeling in general; but, for some reason, all this\nseemed unpleasant and unnatural to Volodya. The principal thing which\nhe noticed was that the other officers hardly spoke to Tchernovitzky.\n\nYunker Vlang, whom he had waked up on the preceding evening, was also\nthere. He said nothing, but, seated modestly in a corner, laughed when\nanything amusing occurred, refreshed their memories when they forgot\nanything, handed the vodka, and made cigarettes for all the officers.\nWhether it was the modest, courteous manners of Volodya, who treated\nhim exactly as he did the officers, and did not torment him as though\nhe were a little boy, or his agreeable personal appearance which\ncaptivated Vlang_a_, as the soldiers called him, declining his name,\nfor some reason or other, in the feminine gender, at all events, he\nnever took his big, kind eyes from the face of the new officer. He\ndivined and anticipated all his wishes, and remained uninterruptedly in\na sort of lover-like ecstasy, which, of course, the officers perceived,\nand made fun of.\n\nBefore dinner, the staff-captain was relieved from the battery, and\njoined their company. Staff-Captain Kraut was a light-complexioned,\nhandsome, dashing officer, with a heavy, reddish moustache, and\nside-whiskers; he spoke Russian capitally, but too elegantly and\ncorrectly for a Russian. In the service and in his life, he had been\nthe same as in his language; he served very well, was a capital\ncomrade, and the most faithful of men in money matters; but simply\nas a man something was lacking in him, precisely because everything\nabout him was so excellent. Like all Russian-Germans, by a strange\ncontradiction with the ideal German, he was "praktisch" to the highest\ndegree.\n\n"Here he is, our hero makes his appearance!" said the captain, as\nKraut, flourishing his arms and jingling his spurs, entered the room.\n"Which will you have, Friedrich Krestyanitch, tea or vodka?"\n\n"I have already ordered my tea to be served," he answered, "but I may\ntake a little drop of vodka also, for the refreshing of the soul.\nVery glad to make your acquaintance; I beg that you will love us, and\nlend us your favor," he said to Volodya, who rose and bowed to him.\n"Staff-Captain Kraut.... The gun-sergeant on the bastion informed me\nthat you arrived last night."\n\n"Much obliged for your bed; I passed the night in it."\n\n"I hope you found it comfortable? One of the legs is broken; but no one\ncan stand on ceremony--in time of siege--you must prop it up."\n\n"Well, now, did you have a fortunate time on your watch?" asked\nDyadenko.\n\n"Yes, all right; only Skvortzoff was hit, and we mended one of the\ngun-carriages last night. The cheek was smashed to atoms."\n\nHe rose from his seat, and began to walk up and down; it was plain that\nhe was wholly under the influence of that agreeable sensation which a\nman experiences who has just escaped a danger.\n\n"Well, Dmitri Gavrilitch," he said, tapping the captain on the knee,\n"how are you getting on, my dear fellow? How about your promotion?--no\nword yet?"\n\n"Nothing yet."\n\n"No, and there will be nothing," interpolated Dyadenko: "I proved that\nto you before."\n\n"Why won\'t there?"\n\n"Because the story was not properly written down."\n\n"Oh, you quarrelsome fellow, you quarrelsome fellow!" said Kraut,\nsmiling gayly; "a regular obstinate Little Russian! Now, just to\nprovoke you, he\'ll turn out your lieutenant."\n\n"No, he won\'t."\n\n"Vlang! fetch me my pipe, and fill it," said he, turning to the yunker,\nwho at once hastened up obligingly with the pipe.\n\nKraut made them all lively; he told about the bombardment, he inquired\nwhat had been going on in his absence, and entered into conversation\nwith every one.\n\n\nXVIII.\n\n"Well, how are things? Have you already got settled among us?" Kraut\nasked Volodya.... "Excuse me, what is your name and patronymic? that\'s\nthe custom with us in the artillery, you know. Have you got hold of a\nsaddle-horse?"\n\n"No," said Volodya; "I do not know what to do. I told the captain that\nI had no horse, and no money, either, until I get some for forage and\ntravelling expenses. I want to ask the battery commander for a horse in\nthe meantime, but I am afraid that he will refuse me."\n\n"Apollon Sergieitch, do you mean?" he produced with his lips a sound\nindicative of the strongest doubt, and glanced at the captain; "not\nlikely."\n\n"What\'s that? If he does refuse, there\'ll be no harm done," said the\ncaptain. "There are horses, to tell the truth, which are not needed,\nbut still one might try; I will inquire to-day."\n\n"What! Don\'t you know him?" Dyadenko interpolated. "He might refuse\nanything, but there is no reason for refusing this. Do you want to bet\non it?..."\n\n"Well, of course, everybody knows already that you always contradict."\n\n"I contradict because I know. He is niggardly about other things, but\nhe will give the horse because it is no advantage to him to refuse."\n\n"No advantage, indeed, when it costs him eight rubles here for oats!"\nsaid Kraut. "Is there no advantage in not keeping an extra horse?"\n\n"Ask Skvoretz yourself, Vladimir Semyonitch!" said Vlang, returning\nwith Kraut\'s pipe. "It\'s a capital horse."\n\n"The one you tumbled into the ditch with, on the festival of the forty\nmartyrs, in March? Hey! Vlang?" remarked the staff-captain.\n\n"No, and why should you say that it costs eight rubles for oats,"\npursued Dyadenko, "when his own inquiries show him that it is ten and a\nhalf; of course, he has no object in it."\n\n"Just as though he would have nothing left! So when you get to be\nbattery commander, you won\'t let any horses go into the town?"\n\n"When I get to be battery commander, my dear fellow, my horses will get\nfour measures of oats to eat, and I shall not accumulate an income,\nnever fear!"\n\n"If we live, we shall see," said the staff-captain; "and you will act\njust so, and so will he when he commands a battery," he added, pointing\nat Volodya.\n\n"Why do you think, Friedrich Krestyanitch, that he would turn it to his\nprofit?" broke in Tchernovitzky. "Perhaps he has property of his own;\nthen why should he turn it to profit?"\n\n"No, sir, I ... excuse me, captain," said Volodya, reddening up to his\nears, "that strikes me as insulting."\n\n"Oh ho, ho! What a madcap he is!" said Kraut.\n\n"That has nothing to do with it; I only think that if the money were\nnot mine, I should not take it."\n\n"Now, I\'ll tell you something right here, young man," began the\nstaff-captain in a more serious tone, "you are to understand that when\nyou command a battery, if you manage things well, that\'s sufficient;\nthe commander of a battery does not meddle with provisioning the\nsoldiers; that is the way it has been from time immemorial in the\nartillery. If you are a bad manager, you will have nothing left. Now,\nthese are the expenditures in conformity with your position: for\nshoeing your horse,--one (he closed one finger); for the apothecary,--two\n(he closed another finger); for office work,--three (he shut a\nthird); for extra horses, which cost five hundred rubles, my dear\nfellow,--that\'s four; you must change the soldiers\' collars, you will\nuse a great deal of coal, you must keep open table for your officers.\nIf you are a battery-commander, you must live decently; you need a\ncarriage, and a fur coat, and this thing and that thing, and a dozen\nmore ... but what\'s the use of enumerating them all!"\n\n"But this is the principal thing, Vladimir Semyonitch," interpolated\nthe captain, who had held his peace all this time; "imagine yourself to\nbe a man who, like myself, for instance, has served twenty years, first\nfor two hundred, then for three hundred rubles pay; why should he not\nbe given at least a bit of bread, against his old age?"\n\n"Eh! yes, there you have it!" spoke up the staff-captain again, "don\'t\nbe in a hurry to pronounce judgment, but live on and serve your time."\n\nVolodya was horribly ashamed and sorry for having spoken so\nthoughtlessly, and he muttered something and continued to listen in\nsilence, when Dyadenko undertook, with the greatest zeal, to dispute it\nand to prove the contrary.\n\nThe dispute was interrupted by the arrival of the colonel\'s servant,\nwho summoned them to dinner.\n\n"Tell Apollon Sergieitch that he must give us some wine to-day," said\nTchernovitzky, to the captain, as he buttoned up his uniform.--"Why is\nhe so stingy with it? He will be killed, and no one will get the good\nof it."\n\n"Tell him yourself."\n\n"Not a bit of it. You are my superior officer. Rank must be regarded in\nall things."\n\n\nXIX.\n\nThe table had been moved out from the wall, and spread with a soiled\ntable-cloth, in the same room in which Volodya had presented himself to\nthe colonel on the preceding evening. The battery commander now offered\nhim his hand, and questioned him about Petersburg and his journey.\n\n"Well, gentlemen, I beg the favor of a glass with any of you who drink\nvodka. The ensigns do not drink," he added, with a smile.\n\nOn the whole, the battery commander did not appear nearly so stern\nto-day as he had on the preceding evening; on the contrary, he had the\nappearance of a kindly, hospitable host, and an elder comrade among the\nofficers. But, in spite of this, all the officers, from the old captain\ndown to Ensign Dyadenko, by their very manner of speaking and looking\nthe commander straight in the eye, as they approached, one after the\nother, to drink their vodka, exhibited great respect for him.\n\nThe dinner consisted of a large wooden bowl of cabbage-soup, in\nwhich floated fat chunks of beef, and a huge quantity of pepper and\nlaurel-leaves, mustard, and Polish meat-balls in a cabbage leaf,\nturnover patties of chopped meat and dough, and with butter, which\nwas not perfectly fresh. There were no napkins, the spoons were of\npewter and wood, there were only two glasses, and on the table stood\na decanter of water with a broken neck; but the dinner was not dull;\nconversation never halted.\n\nAt first, their talk turned on the battle of Inkerman, in which the\nbattery had taken part, as to the causes of failure, of which each one\ngave his own impressions and ideas, and held his tongue as soon as\nthe battery commander himself began to speak; then the conversation\nnaturally changed to the insufficiency of calibre of the light guns,\nand upon the new lightened cannons, in which connection Volodya had an\nopportunity to display his knowledge of artillery.\n\nBut their talk did not dwell upon the present terrible position of\nSevastopol, as though each of them had meditated too much on that\nsubject to allude to it again. In the same way, to Volodya\'s great\namazement and disappointment, not a word was said about the duties\nof the service which he was to fulfil, just as though he had come to\nSevastopol merely for the purpose of telling about the new cannon and\ndining with the commander of the battery.\n\nWhile they were at dinner, a bomb fell not far from the house in which\nthey were seated. The walls and the floor trembled, as though in an\nearthquake, and the window was obscured with the smoke of the powder.\n\n"You did not see anything of this sort in Petersburg, I fancy; but\nthese surprises often take place here," said the battery commander.\n\n"Look out, Vlang, and see where it burst."\n\nVlang looked, and reported that it had burst on the square, and then\nthere was nothing more said about the bomb.\n\nJust before the end of the dinner, an old man, the clerk of the\nbattery, entered the room, with three sealed envelopes, and handed them\nto the commander.\n\n"This is very important; a messenger has this moment brought these from\nthe chief of the artillery."\n\nAll the officers gazed, with impatient curiosity, at the commander\'s\npractised fingers as they broke the seal of the envelope and drew forth\nthe _very important_ paper. "What can it be?" each one asked himself.\n\nIt might be that they were to march out of Sevastopol for a rest, it\nmight be an order for the whole battery to betake themselves to the\nbastions.\n\n"Again!" said the commander, flinging the paper angrily on the table.\n\n"What\'s it about, Apollon Sergieitch?" inquired the eldest officer.\n\n"An officer and crew are required for a mortar battery over yonder,\nand I have only four officers, and there is not a full gun-crew in\nthe line," growled the commander: "and here more are demanded of me.\nBut some one must go, gentlemen," he said, after a brief pause: "the\norder requires him to be at the barrier at seven o\'clock.... Send the\nsergeant! Who is to go, gentlemen? decide," he repeated.\n\n"Well, here\'s one who has never been yet," said Tchernovitzky, pointing\nto Volodya. The commander of the battery made no reply.\n\n"Yes, I should like to go," said Volodya, as he felt the cold sweat\nstart out on his back and neck.\n\n"No; why should you? There\'s no occasion!" broke in the captain. "Of\ncourse, no one will refuse, but neither is it proper to ask any one;\nbut if Apollon Sergieitch will permit us, we will draw lots, as we did\nonce before."\n\nAll agreed to this. Kraut cut some paper into bits, folded them up, and\ndropped them into a cap. The captain jested, and even plucked up the\naudacity, on this occasion, to ask the colonel for wine, to keep up\ntheir courage, he said. Dyadenko sat in gloomy silence, Volodya smiled\nat something or other, Tchernovitzky declared that it would infallibly\nfall to him, Kraut was perfectly composed.\n\nVolodya was allowed to draw first; he took one slip, which was rather\nlong, but it immediately occurred to him to change it; he took another,\nwhich was smaller and thinner, unfolded it, and read on it, "I go."\n\n"It has fallen to me," he said, with a sigh.\n\n"Well, God be with you. You will get your baptism of fire at once,"\nsaid the commander of the battery, gazing at the perturbed countenance\nof the ensign with a kindly smile; "but you must get there as speedily\nas possible. And, to make it more cheerful for you, Vlang shall go with\nyou as gun-sergeant."\n\n\nXX.\n\nVlang was exceedingly well pleased with the duty assigned to him, and\nran hastily to make his preparations, and, when he was dressed, he went\nto the assistance of Volodya, and tried to persuade the latter to take\nhis cot and fur coat with him, and some old "Annals of the Country,"\nand a spirit-lamp coffee-pot, and other useless things. The captain\nadvised Volodya to read up his "Manual,"[L] first, about mortar-firing,\nand immediately to copy the tables out of it.\n\n[L] "Manual for Artillery Officers," by Bezak.\n\nVolodya set about this at once, and, to his amazement and delight, he\nperceived that, though he was still somewhat troubled with a sensation\nof fear of danger, and still more lest he should turn out a coward, yet\nit was far from being to that degree to which it had affected him on\nthe preceding evening. The reason for this lay partly in the daylight\nand in active occupation, and partly, principally, also, in the fact\nthat fear and all powerful emotions cannot long continue with the same\nintensity. In a word, he had already succeeded in recovering from his\nterror.\n\nAt seven o\'clock, just as the sun had begun to hide itself behind the\nNikolaevsky barracks, the sergeant came to him, and announced that the\nmen were ready and waiting for him.\n\n"I have given the list to Vlang_a_. You will please to ask him for it,\nYour Honor!" said he.\n\nTwenty artillery-men, with side-arms, but without loading-tools, were\nstanding at the corner of the house. Volodya and the yunker stepped up\nto them.\n\n"Shall I make them a little speech, or shall I simply say, \'Good day,\nchildren!\' or shall I say nothing at all?" thought he. "And why should\nI not say, \'Good day, children!\' Why, I ought to say that much!" And he\nshouted boldly, in his ringing voice:--\n\n"Good day, children!"\n\nThe soldiers responded cheerfully. The fresh, young voice sounded\npleasant in the ears of all. Volodya marched vigorously at their head,\nin front of the soldiers, and, although his heart beat as if he had run\nseveral versts at the top of his speed, his step was light and his\ncountenance cheerful.\n\nOn arriving at the Malakoff mound, and climbing the slope, he\nperceived that Vlang, who had not lagged a single pace behind him,\nand who had appeared such a valiant fellow at home in the house, kept\nconstantly swerving to one side, and ducking his head, as though all\nthe cannon-balls and bombs, which whizzed by very frequently in that\nlocality, were flying straight at him. Some of the soldiers did the\nsame, and the faces of the majority of them betrayed, if not fear, at\nleast anxiety. This circumstance put the finishing touch to Volodya\'s\ncomposure and encouraged him finally.\n\n"So here I am also on the Malakoff mound, which I imagined to be a\nthousand times more terrible! And I can walk along without ducking my\nhead before the bombs, and am far less terrified than the rest! So I\nam not a coward, after all?" he thought with delight, and even with a\nsomewhat enthusiastic self-sufficiency.\n\nBut this feeling was soon shaken by a spectacle upon which he stumbled\nin the twilight, on the Kornilovsky battery, in his search for the\ncommander of the bastion. Four sailors standing near the breastworks\nwere holding the bloody body of a man, without shoes or coat, by its\narms and legs, and staggering as they tried to fling it over the\nramparts.\n\n(On the second day of the bombardment, it had been found impossible,\nin some localities, to carry off the corpses from the bastions, and so\nthey were flung into the trench, in order that they might not impede\naction in the batteries.)\n\nVolodya stood petrified for a moment, as he saw the corpse waver on\nthe summit of the breastworks, and then roll down into the ditch;\nbut, luckily for him, the commander of the bastion met him there,\ncommunicated his orders, and furnished him with a guide to the battery\nand to the bomb-proofs designated for his service. We will not\nenumerate the remaining dangers and disenchantments which our hero\nunderwent that evening: how, instead of the firing, such as he had seen\non the Volkoff field, according to the rules of accuracy and precision,\nwhich he had expected to find here, he found two cracked mortars, one\nof which had been crushed by a cannon-ball in the muzzle, while the\nother stood upon the splinters of a ruined platform; how he could not\nobtain any workmen until the following morning in order to repair the\nplatform; how not a single charge was of the weight prescribed in the\n"Manual;" how two soldiers of his command were wounded, and how he was\ntwenty times within a hair\'s-breadth of death.\n\nFortunately, there had been assigned for his assistant a gun-captain\nof gigantic size, a sailor, who had served on the mortars since the\nbeginning of the siege, and who convinced him of the practicability of\nusing them, conducted him all over the bastion, with a lantern, during\nthe night, exactly as though it had been his own kitchen-garden, and\nwho promised to put everything in proper shape on the morrow.\n\nThe bomb-proof to which his guide conducted him was excavated in the\nrocky soil, and consisted of a long hole, two cubic fathoms in extent,\ncovered with oaken planks an arshin in thickness. Here he took up his\npost, with all his soldiers. Vlang was the first, when he caught sight\nof the little door, twenty-eight inches high, of the bomb-proof, to\nrush headlong into it, in front of them all, and, after nearly cracking\nhis skull on the stone floor, he huddled down in a corner, from which\nhe did not again emerge.\n\nAnd Volodya, when all the soldiers had placed themselves along the wall\non the floor, and some had lighted their pipes, set up his bed in one\ncorner, lighted a candle, and lay upon his cot, smoking a cigarette.\n\nShots were incessantly heard, over the bomb-proof, but they were not\nvery loud, with the exception of those from one cannon, which stood\nclose by and shook the bomb-proof with its thunder. In the bomb-proof\nitself all was still; the soldiers, who were a little shy, as yet, of\nthe new officer, only exchanged a few words, now and then, as they\nrequested each other to move out of the way or to furnish a light for a\npipe. A rat scratched somewhere among the stones, or Vlang, who had not\nyet recovered himself, and who still gazed wildly about him, uttered a\nsudden vigorous sigh.\n\nVolodya, as he lay on his bed, in his quiet corner, surrounded by\nthe men, and illuminated only by a single candle, experienced that\nsensation of well-being which he had known as a child, when, in the\ncourse of a game of hide-and-seek, he used to crawl into a cupboard or\nunder his mother\'s skirts, and listen, not daring to draw his breath,\nand afraid of the dark, and yet conscious of enjoying himself. He felt\na little oppressed, but cheerful.\n\n\nXXI.\n\nAfter the lapse of about ten minutes, the soldiers began to change\nabout and to converse together. The most important personages among\nthem--the two gun-sergeants--placed themselves nearest the officer\'s\nlight and bed;--one was old and gray-haired, with every possible medal\nand cross except the George;--the other was young, a militia-man, who\nsmoked cigarettes, which he was rolling. The drummer, as usual, assumed\nthe duty of waiting on the officer. The bombardiers and cavalrymen\nsat next, and then farther away, in the shadow of the entrance,\nthe _underlings_ took up their post. They too began to talk among\nthemselves. It was caused by the hasty entrance of a man into the\ncasemate.\n\n"How now, brother! couldn\'t you stay in the street? Didn\'t the girls\nsing merrily?" said a voice.\n\n"They sing such marvellous songs as were never heard in the village,"\nsaid the man who had fled into the casemate, with a laugh.\n\n"But Vasin does not love bombs--ah, no, he does not love them!" said one\nfrom the aristocratic corner.\n\n"The idea! It\'s quite another matter when it\'s necessary," drawled the\nvoice of Vasin, who made all the others keep silent when he spoke:\n"since the 24th, the firing has been going on desperately; and what is\nthere wrong about it? You\'ll get killed for nothing, and your superiors\nwon\'t so much as say \'Thank you!\' for it."\n\nAt these words of Vasin, all burst into a laugh.\n\n"There\'s Melnikoff, that fellow who will sit outside the door," said\nsome one.\n\n"Well, send him here, that Melnikoff," added the old gunner; "they will\nkill him, for a fact, and that to no purpose."\n\n"Who is this Melnikoff?" asked Volodya.\n\n"Why, Your Honor, he\'s a stupid soldier of ours. He doesn\'t seem to be\nafraid of anything, and now he keeps walking about outside. Please to\ntake a look at him; he looks like a bear."\n\n"He knows a spell," said the slow voice of Vasin, from the corner.\n\nMelnikoff entered the bomb-proof. He was fat (which is extremely rare\namong soldiers), and a sandy-complexioned, handsome man, with a huge,\nbulging forehead and prominent, light blue eyes.\n\n"Are you afraid of the bombs?" Volodya asked him.\n\n"What is there about the bombs to be afraid of!" replied Melnikoff,\nshrugging his shoulders and scratching his head, "I know that I shall\nnot be killed by a bomb."\n\n"So you would like to go on living here?"\n\n"Why, of course, I would. It\'s jolly here!" he said, with a sudden\noutburst of laughter.\n\n"Oh, then you must be detailed for the sortie! I\'ll tell the general\nso, if you like?" said Volodya, although he was not acquainted with a\nsingle general there.\n\n"Why shouldn\'t I like! I do!"\n\nAnd Melnikoff disappeared behind the others.\n\n"Let\'s have a game of _noski_,[M] children! Who has cards?" rang out\nhis brisk voice.\n\n[M] A game in which the loser is rapped on the nose with the cards.\n\nAnd, in fact, it was not long before a game was started in the back\ncorner, and blows on the nose, laughter, and calling of trumps were\nheard.\n\nVolodya drank some tea from the samovar, which the drummer served for\nhim, treated the gunners, jested, chatted with them, being desirous of\nwinning popularity, and felt very well content with the respect which\nwas shown him. The soldiers, too, perceiving that the gentleman put on\nno airs, began to talk together.\n\nOne declared that the siege of Sevastopol would soon come to an end,\nbecause a trustworthy man from the fleet had said that the emperor\'s\nbrother Constantine was coming to our relief with the \'Merican fleet,\nand there would soon be an agreement that there should be no firing\nfor two weeks, and that a rest should be allowed, and if any one did\nfire a shot, every discharge would have to be paid for at the rate of\nseventy-five kopeks each.\n\nVasin, who, as Volodya had already noticed, was a little fellow, with\nlarge, kindly eyes, and side-whiskers, related, amid a general silence\nat first, and afterwards amid general laughter, how, when he had gone\nhome on leave, they had been glad at first to see him, but afterwards\nhis father had begun to send him off to work, and the lieutenant of\nthe foresters\' corps sent his drozhki for his wife.\n\nAll this amused Volodya greatly. He not only did not experience the\nleast fear or inconvenience from the closeness and heavy air in the\nbomb-proof, but he felt in a remarkably cheerful and agreeable frame of\nmind.\n\nMany of the soldiers were already snoring. Vlang had also stretched\nhimself out on the floor, and the old gun-sergeant, having spread out\nhis cloak, was crossing himself and muttering his prayers, preparatory\nto sleep, when Volodya took a fancy to step out of the bomb-proof, and\nsee what was going on outside.\n\n"Take your legs out of the way!" cried one soldier to another, as soon\nas he rose, and the legs were pressed aside to make way for him.\n\nVlang, who appeared to be asleep, suddenly raised his head, and seized\nVolodya by the skirt of his coat.\n\n"Come, don\'t go! how can you!" he began, in a tearfully imploring\ntone. "You don\'t know about things yet; they are firing at us out\nthere all the time; it is better here."\n\nBut, in spite of Vlang\'s entreaties, Volodya made his way out of the\nbomb-proof, and seated himself on the threshold, where Melnikoff was\nalready sitting.\n\nThe air was pure and fresh, particularly after the bomb-proof--the night\nwas clear and still. Through the roar of the discharges could be heard\nthe sounds of cart-wheels, bringing gabions, and the voices of the men\nwho were at work on the magazine. Above their heads was the lofty,\nstarry sky, across which flashed the fiery streaks caused by the bombs;\nan arshin away, on the left, a tiny opening led to another bomb-proof,\nthrough which the feet and backs of the soldiers who lived there were\nvisible, and through which their voices were audible; in front, the\nelevation produced by the powder-vault could be seen, and athwart it\nflitted the bent figures of men, and upon it, at the very summit, amid\nthe bullets and the bombs which whistled past the spot incessantly,\nstood a tall form in a black paletot, with his hands in his pockets,\nand feet treading down the earth, which other men were fetching in\nsacks. Often a bomb would fly over, and burst close to the cave. The\nsoldiers engaged in bringing the earth bent over and ran aside; but\nthe black figure never moved; went on quietly stamping down the dirt\nwith his feet, and remained on the spot in the same attitude as before.\n\n"Who is that black man?" inquired Volodya of Melnikoff.\n\n"I don\'t know; I will go and see."\n\n"Don\'t go! it is not necessary."\n\nBut Melnikoff, without heeding him, walked up to the black figure, and\nstood beside him for a tolerably long time, as calm and immovable as\nthe man himself.\n\n"That is the man who has charge of the magazine, Your Honor!" he said,\non his return. "It has been pierced by a bomb, so the infantry-men are\nfetching more earth."\n\nNow and then, a bomb seemed to fly straight at the door of the\nbomb-proof. On such occasions, Volodya shrank into the corner, and then\npeered forth again, gazing upwards, to see whether another was not\ncoming from some direction. Although Vlang, from the interior of the\nbomb-proof, repeatedly besought Volodya to come back, the latter sat on\nthe threshold for three hours, and experienced a sort of satisfaction\nin thus tempting fate and in watching the flight of the bombs. Towards\nthe end of the evening, he had learned from what point most of the\nfiring proceeded, and where the shots struck.\n\n\nXXII.\n\nOn the following day, the 27th, after a ten-hours sleep, Volodya, fresh\nand active, stepped out on the threshold of the casement; Vlang also\nstarted to crawl out with him, but, at the first sound of a bullet, he\nflung himself backwards through the opening of the bomb-proof, bumping\nhis head as he did so, amid the general merriment of the soldiers,\nthe majority of whom had also come out into the open air. Vlang, the\nold gun-sergeant, and a few others were the only ones who rarely went\nout into the trenches; it was impossible to restrain the rest; they\nall scattered about in the fresh morning air, escaping from the fetid\nair of the bomb-proof, and, in spite of the fact that the bombardment\nwas as vigorous as on the preceding evening, they disposed themselves\naround the door, and some even on the breastworks. Melnikoff had been\nstrolling about among the batteries since daybreak, and staring up with\nperfect coolness.\n\nNear the entrance sat two old soldiers and one young, curly-haired\nfellow, a Jew, who had been detailed from the infantry. This soldier\npicked up one of the bullets which were lying about, and, having\nsmoothed it against a stone with a potsherd, with his knife he carved\nfrom it a cross, after the style of the order of St. George; the others\nlooked on at his work as they talked. The cross really turned out to be\nquite handsome.\n\n"Now, if we stay here much longer," said one of them, "then, when peace\nis made, the time of service will be up for all of us."\n\n"Nothing of the sort; I have at least four years service yet before my\ntime is up, and I have been in Sevastopol these five months."\n\n"It is not counted towards the discharge, do you understand," said\nanother.\n\nAt that moment, a cannon-ball shrieked over the heads of the speakers,\nand struck only an arshin away from Melnikoff, who was approaching them\nfrom the trenches.\n\n"That came near killing Melnikoff," said one man.\n\n"I shall not be killed," said Melnikoff.\n\n"Here\'s the cross for you, for your bravery," said the young soldier,\nwho had made the cross, handing it to Melnikoff.\n\n"No, brother, a month here counts for a year, of course--that was the\norder," the conversation continued.\n\n"Think what you please, but when peace is declared, there will be an\nimperial review at Orshava, and if we don\'t get our discharge, we shall\nbe allowed to go on indefinite leave."\n\nAt that moment, a shrieking little bullet flew past the speakers\'\nheads, and struck a stone.\n\n"You\'ll get a full discharge before evening--see if you don\'t," said one\nof the soldiers.\n\nThey all laughed.\n\nNot only before evening, but before the expiration of two hours, two of\nthem received their full discharge, and five were wounded; but the rest\njested on as before.\n\nBy morning, the two mortars had actually been brought into such a\ncondition that it was possible to fire them. At ten o\'clock, in\naccordance with the orders which he had received from the commander of\nthe bastion, Volodya called out his command, and marched to the battery\nwith it.\n\nIn the men, as soon as they proceeded to action, there was not a drop\nof that sentiment of fear perceptible which had been expressed on the\npreceding evening. Vlang alone could not control himself; he dodged and\nducked just as before, and Vasin lost some of his composure, and fussed\nand fidgeted and changed his place incessantly.\n\nBut Volodya was in an extraordinary state of enthusiasm; the thought of\ndanger did not even occur to him. Delight that he was fulfilling his\nduty, that he was not only not a coward, but even a valiant fellow, the\nfeeling that he was in command, and the presence of twenty men, who,\nas he was aware, were surveying him with curiosity, made a thoroughly\nbrave man of him. He was even vain of his valor, put on airs before\nhis soldiers, climbed up on the banquette, and unbuttoned his coat\nexpressly that he might render himself the more distinctly visible.\n\nThe commander of the bastion, who was going the rounds of his\nestablishment as he expressed it, at the moment, accustomed as he had\nbecome during his eight-months experience to all sorts of bravery,\ncould not refrain from admiring this handsome lad, in the unbuttoned\ncoat, beneath which a red shirt was visible, encircling his soft white\nneck, with his animated face and eyes, as he clapped his hands and\nshouted: "First! Second!" and ran gayly along the ramparts, in order to\nsee where his bomb would fall.\n\nAt half-past eleven the firing ceased on both sides, and at precisely\ntwelve o\'clock the storming of the Malakoff mound, of the second,\nthird, and fifth bastions began.\n\n\nXXIII.\n\nOn this side of the bay, between Inkerman and the northern\nfortifications, on the telegraph hill, about midday, stood two naval\nmen; one was an officer, who was engaged in observing Sevastopol\nthrough a telescope, and the other had just arrived at the\nsignal-station with his orderly.\n\nThe sun stood high and brilliant above the bay, and played with the\nships which floated upon it, and with the moving sails and boats, with\na warm and cheerful glow. The light breeze hardly moved the leaves of\nthe dry oak-shrubs which stood about the signal-pole, puffed out the\nsails of the boats, and ruffled the waves.\n\nSevastopol, with her unfinished church, her columns, her line of\nshore, her boulevard showing green against the hill, and her elegant\nlibrary building, with her tiny azure inlets, filled with masts, with\nthe picturesque arches of her aqueducts, and the clouds of blue smoke,\nlighted up now and then by red flashes of flame from the firing; the\nsame beautiful, proud, festive Sevastopol, hemmed in on one side by\nyellow, smoke-crowned hills, on the other by the bright blue sea, which\nglittered in the sun, was visible the same as ever, on the other side\nof the bay.\n\nOver the horizon-line of the sea, along which floated a long wreath of\nblack smoke from some steamer, crept long white clouds, portending a\ngale. Along the entire line of the fortifications, especially over the\nhills on the left, rose columns of thick, dense, white smoke; suddenly,\nabruptly, and incessantly illuminated by flashes, lightnings, which\nshone even amid the light of high noon, and which constantly increased\nin volume, assuming divers forms, as they swept upwards, and tinged\nthe heavens. These puffs of smoke flashing now here, now there, took\ntheir birth on the hills, in the batteries of the enemy, in the city,\nand high against the sky. The sound of the discharges never ceased, but\nshook the air with their mingled roar.\n\nAt twelve o\'clock, the puffs of smoke began to occur less and less\nfrequently, and the atmosphere quivered less with the roar.\n\n"But the second bastion is no longer replying at all," said the officer\nof hussars, who sat there on horseback; "it is utterly destroyed!\nHorrible!"\n\n"Yes, and the Malakoff only sends one shot to their three," replied the\nofficer who was looking through his glass. "It enrages me to have them\nsilent. They are firing straight on the Kornilovsky battery, and it is\nnot answering at all."\n\n"But you see that they always cease the bombardment at twelve o\'clock,\njust as I said. It is the same to-day. Let us go and get some breakfast\n... they are already waiting for us ... there\'s nothing to see."\n\n"Stop, don\'t interfere," said the officer with the glass, gazing at\nSevastopol with peculiar eagerness.\n\n"What\'s going on there? What is it?"\n\n"There is a movement in the trenches, and heavy columns are marching."\n\n"Yes, that is evident," said the other. "The columns are under way. We\nmust give the signal."\n\n"See, see! They have emerged from the trenches."\n\nIn truth, it was visible to the naked eye that dark masses were moving\ndown the hill, across the narrow valley, from the French batteries to\nthe bastions. In front of these specks, dark streaks were visible,\nwhich were already close to our lines. White puffs of smoke of\ndischarges burst out at various points on the bastions, as though the\nfiring were running along the line.\n\nThe breeze bore to them the sounds of musketry-shots, exchanged\nbriskly, like rain upon the window-pane. The black streaks moved on,\nnearer and nearer, into the very smoke. The sounds of firing grew\nlouder and louder, and mingled in a lengthened, resounding roar.\n\nThe smoke, rising more and more frequently, spread rapidly along the\nline, flowed together in one lilac-hued cloud, which dispersed and\njoined again, and through which, here and there, flitted flames and\nblack points--and all sounds were commingled in one reverberating crash.\n\n"An assault," said the officer, with a pale face, as he handed the\nglass to the naval officer.\n\nOrderlies galloped along the road, officers on horseback, the\ncommander-in-chief in a calash, and his suite passed by. Profound\nemotion and expectation were visible on all countenances.\n\n"It cannot be that they have taken it!" said the mounted officer.\n\n"By Heavens, there\'s the standard! Look, look!" said the other, sighing\nand abandoning the glass. "The French standard on the Malakoff!"\n\n"It cannot be!"\n\n\nXXIV.\n\nThe elder Kozeltzoff, who had succeeded in winning back his money and\nlosing it all again that night, including even the gold pieces which\nwere sewed into his cuffs, had fallen, just before daybreak, into a\nheavy, unhealthy, but profound slumber, in the fortified barracks of\nthe fifth battalion, when the fateful cry, repeated by various voices,\nrang out:--\n\n"The alarm!"\n\n"Why are you sleeping, Mikhail Semyonitch! There\'s an assault!" a voice\nshouted to him.\n\n"That is probably some school-boy," he said, opening his eyes, but\nputting no faith in it.\n\nBut all at once he caught sight of an officer running aimlessly from\none corner to the other, with such a pale face that he understood it\nall. The thought that he might be taken for a coward, who did not wish\nto go out to his company at a critical moment, struck him with terrible\nforce. He ran to his corps at the top of his speed. Firing had ceased\nfrom the heavy guns; but the crash of musketry was at its height. The\nbullets whistled, not singly like rifle-balls, but in swarms, like a\nflock of birds in autumn, flying past overhead. The entire spot on\nwhich his battalion had stood the night before was veiled in smoke, and\nthe shouts and cries of the enemy were audible. Soldiers, both wounded\nand unwounded, met him in throngs. After running thirty paces further,\nhe caught sight of his company, which was hugging the wall.\n\n"They have captured Schwartz," said a young officer. "All is lost!"\n\n"Nonsense!" said he, angrily, grasping his blunt little iron sword, and\nhe began to shout:--\n\n"Forward, children! Hurrah!"\n\nHis voice was strong and ringing; it roused even Kozeltzoff himself.\nHe ran forward along the traverse; fifty soldiers rushed after him,\nshouting as they went. From the traverse he ran out upon an open\nsquare. The bullets fell literally like hail. Two struck him,--but\nwhere, and what they did, whether they bruised or wounded him, he had\nnot the time to decide.\n\nIn front, he could already see blue uniforms and red trousers, and\ncould hear shouts which were not Russian; one Frenchman was standing on\nthe breastworks, waving his cap, and shouting something. Kozeltzoff was\nconvinced that he was about to be killed; this gave him courage.\n\nHe ran on and on. Some soldiers overtook him; other soldiers appeared\nat one side, also running. The blue uniforms remained at the same\ndistance from him, fleeing back from him to their own trenches; but\nbeneath his feet were the dead and wounded. When he had run to the\noutermost ditch, everything became confused before Kozeltzoff\'s eyes,\nand he was conscious of a pain in the breast.\n\nHalf an hour later, he was lying on a stretcher, near the Nikolaevsky\nbarracks, and knew that he was wounded, though he felt hardly any pain;\nall he wanted was something cooling to drink, and to be allowed to lie\nstill in peace.\n\nA plump little doctor, with black side-whiskers, approached him, and\nunbuttoned his coat. Kozeltzoff stared over his chin at what the doctor\nwas doing to his wound, and at the doctor\'s face, but he felt no pain.\nThe doctor covered his wound with his shirt, wiped his fingers on the\nskirts of his coat, and, without a word or glance at the wounded man,\nwent off to some one else.\n\nKozeltzoff\'s eyes mechanically took note of what was going on before\nhim, and, recalling the fact that he had been in the fifth bastion,\nhe thought, with an extraordinary feeling of self-satisfaction, that\nhe had fulfilled his duty well, and that, for the first time in all\nhis service, he had behaved as handsomely as it was possible for any\none, and had nothing with which to reproach himself. The doctor, after\nbandaging the other officer\'s wound, pointed to Kozeltzoff, and said\nsomething to a priest, with a huge reddish beard, and a cross, who was\nstanding near by.\n\n"What! am I dying?" Kozeltzoff asked the priest, when the latter\napproached him.\n\nThe priest, without making any reply, recited a prayer and handed the\ncross to the wounded man.\n\nDeath had no terrors for Kozeltzoff. He grasped the cross with his weak\nhands, pressed it to his lips, and burst into tears.\n\n"Well, were the French repulsed?" he inquired of the priest, in firm\ntones.\n\n"The victory has remained with us at every point," replied the priest,\nin order to comfort the wounded man, concealing from him the fact that\nthe French standard had already been unfurled on the Malakoff mound.\n\n"Thank God!" said the wounded man, without feeling the tears which were\ntrickling down his cheeks.\n\nThe thought of his brother occurred to his mind for a single instant.\n"May God grant him the same good-fortune," he said to himself.\n\n\nXXV.\n\nBut the same fate did not await Volodya. He was listening to a tale\nwhich Vasin was in the act of relating to him, when there was a\ncry,--"The French are coming!" The blood fled for a moment to Volodya\'s\nheart, and he felt his cheeks turn cold and pale. For one second he\nremained motionless, but, on glancing about him, he perceived that\nthe soldiers were buttoning up their coats with tolerable equanimity,\nand crawling out, one after the other. One even, probably Melnikoff,\nremarked, in a jesting way:--\n\n"Go out and offer them the bread and salt of hospitality, children!"\n\nVolodya, in company with Vlang, who never separated from him by so much\nas a step, crawled out of the bomb-proof, and ran to the battery.\n\nThere was no artillery firing whatever in progress on either side. It\nwas not so much the sight of the soldiers\' composure which aroused\nhis courage as the pitiful and undisguised cowardice of Vlang. "Is\nit possible for me to be like him?" he said to himself, and he ran\non gayly up to the breastworks, near which his mortars stood. It was\nclearly apparent to him that the French were making straight for him\nthrough an open space, and that masses of them, with their bayonets\nglittering in the sun, were moving in the nearest trenches.\n\nOne, a short, broad-shouldered fellow, in zouave uniform, and armed\nwith a sword, ran on in front and leaped the ditch.\n\n"Fire grape-shot!" shouted Volodya, hastening from the banquette;\nbut the soldiers had already made their preparations without waiting\nfor his orders, and the metallic sound of the grape-shot which they\ndischarged shrieked over his head, first from one and then from the\nother mortar.\n\n"First! second!" commanded Volodya, running from one mortar to the\nother, and utterly oblivious of danger.\n\nOn one side, and near at hand, the crash of musketry from our men under\nshelter, and anxious cries, were heard.\n\nAll at once a startling cry of despair, repeated by several voices, was\nheard on the left: "They are surrounding us! They are surrounding us!"\n\nVolodya looked round at this shout. Twenty Frenchmen made their\nappearance in the rear. One of them, a handsome man with a black beard,\nwas in front of all; but, after running up to within ten paces of the\nbattery, he halted, and fired straight at Volodya, and then ran towards\nhim once more.\n\nFor a second, Volodya stood as though turned to stone, and did not\nbelieve his eyes. When he recovered himself and glanced about him,\nthere were blue uniforms in front of him on the ramparts; two Frenchmen\nwere even spiking a cannon not ten paces distant from him.\n\nThere was no one near him, with the exception of Melnikoff, who had\nbeen killed by a bullet beside him, and Vlang, who, with a handspike\nclutched in his hand, had rushed forwards, with an expression of wrath\non his face, and with eyes lowered.\n\n"Follow me, Vladimir Semyonitch! Follow me!" shouted the desperate\nvoice of Vlang, as he brandished his handspike over the French, who\nwere pouring in from the rear. The yunker\'s ferocious countenance\nstartled them. He struck the one who was in advance, on the head; the\nothers involuntarily paused, and Vlang continued to glare about him,\nand to shout in despairing accents: "Follow me, Vladimir Semyonitch!\nWhy do you stand there? Run!" and ran towards the trenches in which lay\nour infantry, firing at the French. After leaping into the trench, he\ncame out again to see what his adored ensign was doing. Something in a\ncoat was lying prostrate where Volodya had been standing, and the whole\nplace was filled with Frenchmen, who were firing at our men.\n\n\nXXVI.\n\nVlang found his battery on the second line of defence. Out of the\ntwenty soldiers who had been in the mortar battery, only eight survived.\n\nAt nine o\'clock in the evening, Vlang set out with the battery on a\nsteamer loaded down with soldiers, cannon, horses, and wounded men, for\nSevernaya.\n\nThere was no firing anywhere. The stars shone brilliantly in the\nsky, as on the preceding night; but a strong wind tossed the sea. On\nthe first and second bastions, lightnings flashed along the earth;\nexplosions rent the atmosphere, and illuminated strange black objects\nin their vicinity, and the stones which flew through the air.\n\nSomething was burning near the docks, and the red glare was reflected\nin the water. The bridge, covered with people, was lighted up by the\nfire from the Nikolaevsky battery. A vast flame seemed to hang over the\nwater, from the distant promontory of the Alexandrovsky battery, and\nilluminated the clouds of smoke beneath, as it rose above them; and\nthe same tranquil, insolent, distant lights as on the preceding evening\ngleamed over the sea, from the hostile fleet.\n\nThe fresh breeze raised billows in the bay. By the red light of the\nconflagrations, the masts of our sunken ships, which were settling\ndeeper and deeper into the water, were visible. Not a sound of\nconversation was heard on deck; there was nothing but the regular swish\nof the parted waves, and the steam, the neighing and pawing of the\nhorses, the words of command from the captain, and the groans of the\nwounded. Vlang, who had had nothing to eat all day, drew a bit of bread\nfrom his pocket, and began to chew it; but all at once he recalled\nVolodya, and burst into such loud weeping that the soldiers who were\nnear him heard it.\n\n"See how our Vlang_a_[N] is eating his bread and crying too," said\nVasin.\n\n[N] The feminine form, as previously referred to.\n\n"Wonderful!" said another.\n\n"And see, they have fired our barracks," he continued, with a sigh.\n"And how many of our brothers perished there; and the French got it for\nnothing!"\n\n"At all events, we have got out of it alive--thank God for that!" said\nVasin.\n\n"But it\'s provoking, all the same!"\n\n"What is there provoking about it? Do you suppose they are enjoying\nthemselves there? Not exactly! You wait, our men will take it away from\nthem again. And however many of our brethren perish, as God is holy, if\nthe emperor commands, they will win it back. Can ours leave it to them\nthus? Never! There you have the bare walls; but they have destroyed all\nthe breastworks. Even if they have planted their standard on the hill,\nthey won\'t be able to make their way into the town."\n\n"Just wait, we\'ll have a hearty reckoning with you yet, only give us\ntime," he concluded, addressing himself to the French.\n\n"Of course we will!" said another, with conviction.\n\nAlong the whole line of bastions of Sevastopol, which had for so many\nmonths seethed with remarkably vigorous life, which had for so many\nmonths seen dying heroes relieved one after another by death, and which\nhad for so many months awakened the terror, the hatred, and finally\nthe admiration of the enemy,--on the bastions of Sevastopol, there was\nno longer a single man. All was dead, wild, horrible,--but not silent.\n\nDestruction was still in progress. On the earth, furrowed and strewn\nwith the recent explosions, lay bent gun-carriages, crushing down the\nbodies of Russians and of the foe; heavy iron cannons silenced forever,\nbombs and cannon-balls hurled with horrible force into pits, and\nhalf-buried in the soil, then more corpses, pits, splinters of beams,\nbomb-proofs, and still more silent bodies in gray and blue coats. All\nthese were still frequently shaken and lighted up by the crimson glow\nof the explosions, which continued to shock the air.\n\nThe foe perceived that something incomprehensible was going on in that\nmenacing Sevastopol. Those explosions and the death-like silence on\nthe bastions made them shudder; but they dared not yet believe, being\nstill under the influence of the calm and forcible resistance of the\nday, that their invincible enemy had disappeared, and they awaited\nmotionless and in silence the end of that gloomy night.\n\nThe army of Sevastopol, like the gloomy, surging sea, quivering\nthroughout its entire mass, wavering, ploughing across the bay, on\nthe bridge, and at the north fortifications, moved slowly through the\nimpenetrable darkness of the night; away from the place where it had\nleft so many of its brave brethren, from the place all steeped in its\nblood, from the place which it had defended for eleven months against\na foe twice as powerful as itself, and which it was now ordered to\nabandon without a battle.\n\nThe first impression produced on every Russian by this command was\ninconceivably sad. The second feeling was a fear of pursuit. The men\nfelt that they were defenceless as soon as they abandoned the places on\nwhich they were accustomed to fight, and they huddled together uneasily\nin the dark, at the entrance to the bridge, which was swaying about in\nthe heavy breeze.\n\nThe infantry pressed forward, with a clash of bayonets, and a\nthronging of regiments, equipages, and arms; cavalry officers made\ntheir way about with orders, the inhabitants and the military servants\naccompanying the baggage wept and besought to be permitted to cross,\nwhile the artillery, in haste to get off, forced their way to the bay\nwith a thunder of wheels.\n\nIn spite of the diversions created by the varied and anxious demands\non their attention, the instinct of self-preservation and the desire\nto escape as speedily as possible from that dread place of death were\npresent in every soul. This instinct existed also in a soldier mortally\nwounded, who lay among the five hundred other wounded, upon the stone\npavement of the Pavlovsky quay, and prayed God to send death; and in\nthe militia-man, who with his last remaining strength pressed into\nthe compact throng, in order to make way for a general who rode by,\nand in the general in charge of the transportation, who was engaged\nin restraining the haste of the soldiers, and in the sailor, who had\nbecome entangled in the moving battalion, and who, crushed by the\nsurging throng, had lost his breath, and in the wounded officer, who\nwas being borne along in a litter by four soldiers, who, stopped by the\ncrowd, had placed him on the ground by the Nikolaevsky battery, and in\nthe artillery-man, who had served his gun for sixteen years, and who,\nat his superior\'s command, to him incomprehensible, to throw overboard\nthe guns, had, with the aid of his comrades, sent them over the steep\nbank into the bay; and in the men of the fleet, who had just closed the\nport-holes of the ships, and had rowed lustily away in their boats.\nOn stepping upon the further end of the bridge, nearly every soldier\npulled off his cap and crossed himself.\n\nBut behind this instinct there was another, oppressive and far deeper,\nexisting along with it; this was a feeling which resembled repentance,\nshame, and hatred. Almost every soldier, as he gazed on abandoned\nSevastopol, from the northern shore, sighed with inexpressible\nbitterness of heart, and menaced the foe.\n\n\n\n\nPUBLICATIONS\n\nOF\n\nTHOMAS Y.
