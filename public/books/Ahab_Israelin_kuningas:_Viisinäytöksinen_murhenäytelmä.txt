To our village, consisting of\neighty homesteads, from half a dozen to a dozen cold, hungry, tattered\ntramps come every day, wanting a night\'s lodging.\n\nThese people, ragged, half-naked, barefoot, often ill, and extremely\ndirty, come into the village and go to the village policeman. That\nthey should not die in the street of hunger and exposure, he quarters\nthem on the inhabitants of the village, regarding only the peasants as\n"inhabitants." He does not take them to the squire, who besides his own\nten rooms has ten other apartments: office, coachman\'s room, laundry,\nservants\' and upper-servants\' hall and so on; nor does he take them to\nthe priest or deacon or shopkeeper, in whose houses, though not large,\nthere is still some spare room; but he takes them to the peasants,\nwhose whole family, wife, daughters-in-law, unmarried daughters, and\nbig and little children, all live in one room--sixteen, nineteen, or\ntwenty-three feet long. And the master of the hut takes the cold,\nhungry, stinking, ragged, dirty man, and not merely gives him a night\'s\nlodging, but feeds him as well.\n\n"When you sit down to table yourself," an old peasant householder told\nme, "it\'s impossible not to invite him too, or your own soul accepts\nnothing. So one feeds him and gives him a drink of tea."\n\nThose are the nightly visitors. But during the day, not two or three,\nbut ten or more such visitors call at each hut, and again it is: "Why,\nit is impossible...," etc.\n\nAnd for almost every tramp the housewife cuts a slice of bread, thinner\nor thicker according to the man\'s appearance--though she knows her rye\nwill not last till next harvest.\n\n"If you were to give to all who come, a loaf [the big peasant loaf of\nblack bread] would not last a day," some housewives said to me. "So\nsometimes one hardens one\'s heart and refuses!"\n\nAnd this goes on every day, all over Russia. An enormous\nyearly-increasing army of beggars, cripples, administrative exiles,\nhelpless old men, and above all unemployed workmen, lives--that is to\nsay, shelters itself from cold and wet--and is actually fed by the\nhardest-worked and poorest class, the country peasants.\n\nWe have Workhouses,[1] Foundlings\' Hospitals, Boards of Public Relief,\nand all sorts of philanthropic organisations in our towns; and in all\nthose institutions, in buildings with electric light, parquet floors,\nneat servants, and various well-paid attendants, thousands of helpless\npeople of all sorts are sheltered. But however many such there may\nbe, they are but a drop in the ocean of the enormous (unnumbered, but\ncertainly enormous) population which now tramps destitute over Russia,\nand is sheltered and fed apart from any institutions, solely by the\nvillage peasants whose own Christian feelings induce them to bear this\nheavy and gigantic tax.\n\n       [1] Not in the English sense, for there is no Poor-Law system\n       entitling the destitute to demand maintenance.\n\nJust think what people who are not peasants would say, if--even once\na week--such a shivering, starving, dirty, lousy tramp were placed in\neach of their bedrooms! But the peasants not only house them, but feed\nthem and give them tea, because "one\'s own soul accepts nothing unless\none has them to table."\n\nIn the more remote parts of Sar\xc3\xa1tof, Tamb\xc3\xb3f, and other Provinces, the\npeasants do not wait for the policeman to bring these tramps, but\nalways receive them and feed them of their own accord.\n\nAnd, as is the case with all really good deeds, the peasants do this\nwithout knowing that they are doing a good deed; and yet it is not\nmerely a good deed "for one\'s soul," but is of enormous importance\nfor the whole of Russian society. It is of such importance for Russian\nsociety because, but for this peasant population and the Christian\nfeeling that lives so strongly in it, it is difficult to imagine\nwhat the fate would be, not only of these hundreds of thousands\nof unfortunate, houseless tramps, but of all the well-to-do--and\nespecially of the wealthy who have their houses in the country.\n\nIt is only necessary to see the state of privation and suffering to\nwhich these homeless tramps have come or have been brought, and to\nimagine the mental condition they must be in, and to realise that it\nis only this help rendered to them by the peasants that restrains\nthem from committing violence, which would be quite natural in their\nposition, upon those who possess in superfluity all the things these\nunfortunates lack to keep themselves alive.\n\nSo that it is not the philanthropic organisations, not the Government\nwith its police and all its juridical institutions, that protects\nus, the well-to-do, from being attacked by those who wander, cold,\nhungry, and homeless, after having sunk--or, for the most part, having\nbeen brought--to the lowest depths of poverty and despair; but we are\nprotected, as well as fed and supported, by that same basic strength of\nthe Russian nation--the peasantry.\n\nYes! Were it not that there is among Russia\'s vast peasant population\na deep religious consciousness of the brotherhood of all men, not\nonly would these homeless people, having reached the last stages of\ndespair, have long since destroyed the houses of the rich, in spite\nof any police force (there are and must be so few of them in country\ndistricts), but they would even have killed all who stood in their\nway. So that we ought not to be horrified or surprised when we hear or\nread of people being robbed, or killed that they may be robbed, but we\nshould understand and remember that if such things happen as seldom as\nthey do, we owe this to the unselfish help rendered by the peasants to\nthis unfortunate tramping population.\n\nEvery day from ten to fifteen people come to our house to beg. Some\namong them are regular beggars, who for some reason have chosen that\nmeans of livelihood, and having clothed and shod themselves as best\nthey might, and having made sacks to hold what they collect, have\nstarted out to tramp the country. Among them some are blind, and\nsome have lost a leg or an arm; and sometimes, though rarely, there\nare women and children among them. But these are only a small part.\nThe majority of the beggars that come now are passers-by, without a\nbeggar\'s sack, mostly young, and not crippled. They are all in a most\npitiable state, barefoot, half-naked, emaciated, and shivering with\ncold. You ask them, "Where are you going?" The answer is always the\nsame: "To look for work"; or, "Have been looking for work, but found\nnone, and am making my way home. There\'s no work; they are shutting\ndown everywhere." Many of these people are returning from exile.\n\nA few days ago I was barely awake when our servant, Ily\xc3\xa1 Vas\xc3\xadlyevitch,\ntold me:\n\n"There are five tramps waiting near the porch."\n\n"Take some money there is on the table, and give it them," said I.\n\nIly\xc3\xa1 Vas\xc3\xadlyevitch took it, and, as is the custom, gave each of them\nfive copecks [five farthings]. About an hour passed. I went out into\nthe porch. A dreadfully tattered little man with a sickly face, swollen\neyelids, restless eyes, and boots all falling to pieces, began bowing,\nand held out a certificate to me.\n\n"Have you received something?"\n\n"Your Excellency, what am I to do with five copecks?... Your\nExcellency, put yourself in my place! Please, your Excellency, look\n... please see!" and he shows me his clothing. "Where am I to go to,\nyour Excellency?" (it is "Excellency" after every word, though his face\nexpresses hatred). "What am I to do? Where am I to go?"\n\nI tell him that I give to all alike. He continues to entreat, and\ndemands that I should read his certificate. I refuse. He kneels down. I\nask him to leave me.\n\n"Very well! That means, it seems, that I must put an end to myself!\nThat\'s all that\'s left me to do.... Give me something, if only a\ntrifle!"\n\nI give him twenty copecks, and he goes away, evidently angry.\n\nThere are a great many such peculiarly insistent beggars, who feel they\nhave a right to demand their share from the rich. They are literate\nfor the most part, and some of them are even well-read persons on whom\nthe Revolution has had an effect. These men, unlike the ordinary,\nold-fashioned beggars, look on the rich, not as on people who wish\nto save their souls by distributing alms, but as on highwaymen and\nrobbers who suck the blood of the working classes. It often happens\nthat a beggar of this sort does no work himself and carefully avoids\nwork, and yet considers himself, in the name of the workers, not merely\njustified, but bound, to hate the robbers of the people--that is to\nsay, the rich--and to hate them from the depths of his heart; and if,\ninstead of demanding from them, he begs, that is only a pretence.\n\nThere are a great number of these men, many of them drunkards, of whom\none feels inclined to say, "It\'s their own fault"; but there are also\na great many tramps of quite a different type: meek, humble, and very\npathetic, and it is terrible to think of their position.\n\nHere is a tall, good-looking man, with nothing on over his short,\ntattered jacket. His boots are bad and trodden down. He has a good,\nintelligent face. He takes off his cap and begs in the ordinary way. I\ngive him something, and he thanks me. I ask him where he comes from\nand where he is going to.\n\n"From Petersburg, home to our village in To\xc3\xbala Government."\n\nI ask him, "Why on foot?"\n\n"It\'s a long story," he answers, shrugging his shoulders.\n\nI ask him to tell it me. He relates it with evident truthfulness.\n\n"I had a good place in an office in Petersburg, and received thirty\nroubles [three guineas] a month. Lived very comfortably. I have read\nyour books _War and Peace_ and _Anna Kar\xc3\xa9nina_," says he, again smiling\na particularly pleasant smile. "Then my folks at home got the idea\nof migrating to Siberia, to the Province of Tomsk." They wrote to\nhim asking whether he would agree to sell his share of land in the\nold place. He agreed. His people left, but the land allotted them in\nSiberia turned out worthless. They spent all they had, and came back.\nBeing now landless, they are living in hired lodgings in their former\nvillage, and work for wages. It happened, just at the same time, that\nhe lost his place in Petersburg. It was not his doing. The firm he was\nwith became bankrupt, and dismissed its employees. "And just then, to\ntell the truth, I came across a seamstress." He smiled again. "She\nquite entangled me.... I used to help my people, and now see what a\nsmart chap I have become!... Ah well, God is not without mercy; maybe\nI\'ll manage somehow!"\n\nHe was evidently an intelligent, strong, active fellow, and only a\nseries of misfortunes had brought him to his present condition.\n\nTake another: his legs swathed in strips of rag; girdled with a rope;\nhis clothing quite threadbare and full of small holes, evidently\nnot torn, but worn-out to the last degree; his face, with its high\ncheek-bones, pleasant, intelligent, and sober. I give him the customary\nfive copecks, and he thanks me and we start a conversation. He has been\nan administrative exile in Vy\xc3\xa1tka. It was bad enough there, but it is\nworse here. He is going to Ryaz\xc3\xa1n, where he used to live. I ask him\nwhat he has been. "A newspaper man. I took the papers round."\n\n"For what were you exiled?"\n\n"For selling forbidden literature."\n\nWe began talking about the Revolution. I told him my opinion, that the\nevil was all in ourselves; and that such an enormous power as that of\nthe Government cannot be destroyed by force. "Evil outside ourselves\nwill only be destroyed when we have destroyed it within us," said I.\n\n"That is so, but not for a long time."\n\n"It depends on us."\n\n"I have read your book on Revolution."\n\n"It is not mine, but I agree with it."\n\n"I wished to ask you for some of your books."\n\n"I should be very pleased.... Only I\'m afraid they may get you into\ntrouble. I\'ll give you the most harmless."\n\n"Oh, I don\'t care! I am no longer afraid of anything.... Prison is\nbetter for me than this! I am not afraid of prison.... I even long for\nit sometimes," he said sadly.\n\n"What a pity it is that so much strength is wasted uselessly!" said I.\n"How people like you destroy your own lives!... Well, and what do you\nmean to do now?"\n\n"I?" he said, looking intently into my face.\n\nAt first, while we talked about past events and general topics, he had\nanswered me boldly and cheerfully; but as soon as our conversation\nreferred to himself personally and he noticed my sympathy, he turned\naway, hid his eyes with his sleeve, and I noticed that the back of his\nhead was shaking.\n\nAnd how many such people there are!\n\nThey are pitiable and pathetic, and they, too, stand on the threshold\nbeyond which a state of despair begins that makes even a kindly man\nready to go all lengths.\n\n"Stable as our civilisation may seem to us," says Henry George,\n"disintegrating forces are already developing within it. Not in deserts\nand forests, but in city slums and on the highways, the barbarians are\nbeing bred who will do for our civilisation what the Huns and Vandals\ndid for the civilisation of former ages."\n\nYes! What Henry George foretold some twenty years ago, is happening\nnow before our eyes, and in Russia most glaringly--thanks to the\namazing blindness of our Government, which carefully undermines the\nfoundations on which alone any and every social order stands or can\nstand.\n\nWe have the Vandals foretold by Henry George quite ready among us in\nRussia. And, strange as it may seem to say so, these Vandals, these\ndoomed men, are specially dreadful here among our deeply religious\npopulation. These Vandals are specially dreadful here, because we have\nnot the restraining principles of convention, propriety, and public\nopinion, that are so strongly developed among the European nations. We\nhave either real, deep, religious feeling, or--as in St\xc3\xa9nka R\xc3\xa1zin and\nPougatch\xc3\xa9f--a total absence of any restraining principle: and, dreadful\nto say, this army of St\xc3\xa9nkas and Pougatch\xc3\xa9fs is growing greater and\ngreater, thanks to the Pougatch\xc3\xa9f-like conduct of our Government\nin these later days, with its horrors of police violence, insane\nbanishments, imprisonments, exiles, fortresses, and daily executions.\n\nSuch actions release the St\xc3\xa9nka R\xc3\xa1zins from the last remnants of moral\nrestraint. "If the learned gentlefolk act like that, God Himself\npermits us to do so," say and think they.\n\nI often receive letters from that class of men, chiefly exiles. They\nknow I have written something about not resisting evil by violence, and\nfor the greater part they retort ungrammatically, though with great\nfervour, that what the Government and the rich are doing to the poor,\ncan and must be answered only in one way: "Revenge, revenge, revenge!"\n\nYes! The blindness of our Government is amazing. It does not and will\nnot see that all it does to disarm its enemies merely increases their\nnumber and energy. Yes! These people are terrible, terrible for the\nGovernment and for the rich, and for those who live among the rich.\n\nBut besides the feeling of terror these people inspire, there is also\nanother feeling, much more imperative than that of fear, and one we\ncannot help experiencing towards those who, by a series of accidents,\nhave fallen into this terrible condition of vagrancy. That feeling is\none of shame and sympathy.\n\nAnd it is not fear, so much as shame and pity, that should oblige us,\nwho are not in that condition, to respond in one way or other to this\nnew and terrible phenomenon in Russian life.[2]\n\n       [2] One of the most depressing features of L. N. Tolstoy\'s\n       environment is the large number of unemployed and beggars\n       from the adjacent highway. They wait outside the house for\n       hours every day for the coming of Leo Nikolayevich. The\n       consciousness of his inability to render them substantial aid\n       weighs heavily upon him, as does also the fact that, owing\n       to insurmountable obstacles, he cannot even feed them, and\n       allow them to sleep in the house in which he himself lives.\n       These unfortunates surround Leo Nikolayevich at the steps,\n       and besiege him with their importunate requests, just at the\n       time when he seeks the fresh air and is most in need of mental\n       rest and solitude after long-continued and strenuous mental\n       labour. In view of this fact, the idea has occurred to some\n       of Leo Nikolayevich\'s friends, of establishing in the village\n       of Y\xc3\xa1snaya Poly\xc3\xa1na a lodging- and eating-house for tramps,\n       the use of which by the latter would save L. N. unnecessary\n       trouble. The establishment of such premises--L. N. has viewed\n       the idea very favourably--would at least afford some temporary\n       relief to the wandering poor who are in dire need. At the\n       same time the peasantry of Y\xc3\xa1snaya Poly\xc3\xa1na would be relieved\n       of the too heavy burden of supporting the passing unemployed\n       described by Tolstoy in his article. Lastly, it would afford\n       Tolstoy, in his declining years, considerable mental relief,\n       which it would seem that he has more than deserved by his\n       incessant labours on behalf of distressed mankind. Perhaps\n       among those who read the present sketches some will be found\n       who, prompted by the impulses animating the author, may desire\n       to render some material help towards the practical realisation\n       of the projected undertaking.\n\n       Contributions may be sent to the following address: V.\n       Tchertkoff, Editor of the Free Age Press, Christchurch, Hants,\n       Eng.\n\n\n                             _SECOND DAY_\n\n                       THE LIVING AND THE DYING\n\nAs I sat at my work, Ily\xc3\xa1 Vas\xc3\xadlyevitch entered softly and, evidently\nreluctant to disturb me at my work, told me that some wayfarers and a\nwoman had been waiting a long time to see me.\n\n"Here," I said, "please take this, and give it them."\n\n"The woman has come about some business."\n\nI told him to ask her to wait a while, and continued my work. By the\ntime I came out, I had quite forgotten about her, till I saw a young\npeasant woman with a long, thin face, and clad very poorly and too\nlightly for the weather, appear from behind a corner of the house.\n\n"What do you want? What is the matter?"\n\n"I\'ve come to see you, your Honour."\n\n"Yes ... what about? What is the matter?"\n\n"To see you, your Honour."\n\n"Well, what is it?"\n\n"He\'s been taken wrongfully.... I\'m left with three children."\n\n"Who\'s been taken, and where to?"\n\n"My husband ... sent off to Krap\xc3\xadvny."\n\n"Why? What for?"\n\n"For a soldier, you know. But it\'s wrong--because, you see, he\'s the\nbreadwinner! We can\'t get on without him.... Be a father to us, sir!"\n\n"But how is it? Is he the only man in the family?"\n\n"Just so ... the only man!"\n\n"Then how is it they have taken him, if he\'s the only man?"\n\n"Who can tell why they\'ve done it?... Here am I, left alone with the\nchildren! There\'s nothing for me but to die.... Only I\'m sorry for the\nchildren! My last hope is in your kindness, because, you see, it was\nnot right!"\n\nI wrote down the name of her village, and her name and surname, and\ntold her I would see about it and let her know.\n\n"Help me, if it\'s only ever so little!... The children are hungry, and,\nGod\'s my witness, I haven\'t so much as a crust. The baby is worst of\nall ... there\'s no milk in my breasts. If only the Lord would take him!"\n\n"Haven\'t you a cow?" I asked.\n\n"A cow? Oh, no!... Why, we\'re all starving!" said she, crying, and\ntrembling all over in her tattered coat.\n\nI let her go, and prepared for my customary walk. It turned out that\nthe doctor, who lives with us, was going to visit a patient in the\nvillage the soldier\'s wife had come from, and another patient in the\nvillage where the District Police Station is situated, so I joined him,\nand we drove off together.\n\nI went into the Police Station, while the doctor attended to his\nbusiness in that village.\n\nThe District Elder was not in, nor the clerk, but only the clerk\'s\nassistant--a clever lad whom I knew. I asked him about the woman\'s\nhusband, and why, being the only man in the family, he had been taken\nas a conscript.\n\nThe clerk\'s assistant looked up the particulars, and replied that the\nwoman\'s husband was not the only man in the family: he had a brother.\n\n"Then why did she say he was the only one?"\n\n"She lied! They always do," replied he, with a smile.\n\nI made some inquiries about other matters I had to attend to, and then\nthe doctor returned from visiting his patient, and we drove towards the\nvillage in which the soldier\'s wife lived. But before we were out of\nthe first village, a girl of about twelve came quickly across the road\ntowards us.\n\n"I suppose you\'re wanted?" I said to the doctor.\n\n"No, it\'s your Honour I want," said the girl to me.\n\n"What is it?"\n\n"I\'ve come to your Honour, as mother is dead, and we are left\norphans--five of us. Help us!... Think of our needs!"\n\n"Where do you come from?"\n\nThe girl pointed to a brick house, not badly built.\n\n"From here ... that is our house. Come and see for yourself!"\n\nI got out of the sledge, and went towards the house. A woman came out\nand asked me in. She was the orphans\' aunt. I entered a large, clean\nroom; all the children were there, four of them: besides the eldest\ngirl--two boys, a girl, and another boy of about two. Their aunt told\nme all about the family\'s circumstances. Two years ago the father had\nbeen killed in a mine. The widow tried to get compensation, but failed.\nShe was left with four children; the fifth was born after her husband\'s\ndeath. She struggled on alone as best she could, hiring a labourer at\nfirst to work her land. But without her husband things went worse and\nworse. First they had to sell their cow, then the horse, and at last\nonly two sheep were left. Still they managed to live somehow; but two\nmonths ago the woman herself fell ill and died, leaving five children,\nthe eldest twelve years old.\n\n"They must get along as best they can. I try to help them, but can\'t do\nmuch. I can\'t think what\'s to become of them! I wish they\'d die!... If\none could only get them into some Orphanage--or at least some of them!"\n\nThe eldest girl evidently understood and took in the whole of my\nconversation with her aunt.\n\n"If at least one could get little Nicky placed somewhere! It\'s awful;\none can\'t leave him for a moment," said she, pointing to the sturdy\nlittle two-year old urchin, who with his little sister was merrily\nlaughing at something or other, and evidently did not at all share his\naunt\'s wish.\n\nI promised to take steps to get one or more of the children into an\nOrphanage. The eldest girl thanked me, and asked when she should come\nfor an answer. The eyes of all the children, even of Nicky, were fixed\non me, as on some fairy being capable of doing anything for them.\n\nBefore I had reached the sledge, after leaving the house, I met an old\nman. He bowed, and at once began speaking about these same orphans.\n\n"What misery!" he said; "it\'s pitiful to see them. And the eldest\nlittle girlie, how she looks after them--just like a mother! Wonderful\nhow the Lord helps her! It\'s a mercy the neighbours don\'t forsake them,\nor they\'d simply die of hunger, the dear little things!... They are the\nsort of people it does no harm to help," he added, evidently advising\nme to do so.\n\nI took leave of the old man, the aunt, and the little girl, and drove\nwith the doctor to the woman who had been to see me that morning.\n\nAt the first house we came to, I inquired where she lived. It happened\nto be the house of a widow I know very well; she lives on the alms she\nbegs, and she has a particularly importunate and pertinacious way of\nextorting them. As usual, she at once began to beg. She said she was\njust now in special need of help to enable her to rear a calf.\n\n"She\'s eating me and the old woman out of house and home. Come in and\nsee her."\n\n"And how is the old woman?"\n\n"What about the old woman?... She\'s hanging on...."\n\nI promised to come and see, not so much the calf as the old woman, and\nagain inquired where the soldier\'s wife lived. The widow pointed to the\nnext hut but one, and hastened to add that no doubt they were poor, but\nher brother-in-law "does drink dreadfully!"\n\nFollowing her instructions, I went to the next house but one.\n\nMiserable as are the huts of all the poor in our villages, it is long\nsince I saw one so dilapidated as that. Not only the whole roof, but\nthe walls were so crooked that the windows were aslant.\n\nInside, it was no better than outside. The brick oven took up one-third\nof the black, dirty little hut, which to my surprise was full of\npeople. I thought I should find the widow alone with her children;\nbut here was a sister-in-law (a young woman with children) and an old\nmother-in-law. The soldier\'s wife herself had just returned from her\nvisit to me, and was warming herself on the top of the oven. While she\nwas getting down, her mother-in-law began telling me of their life.\nHer two sons had lived together at first, and they all managed to feed\nthemselves.\n\n"But who remain together nowadays? All separate," the garrulous old\nwoman went on. "The wives began quarrelling, so the brothers separated,\nand life became still harder. We had little land, and only managed to\nlive by their wage-labour; and now they have taken Peter as a soldier!\nSo where is she to turn to with her children? She\'s living with us now,\nbut we can\'t manage to feed them all! We can\'t think what we are to do.\nThey say he may be got back."\n\nThe soldier\'s wife, having climbed down from the oven, continued\nto implore me to take steps to get her husband back. I told her it\nwas impossible, and asked what property her husband had left behind\nwith his brother, to keep her and the children. There was none. He\nhad handed over his land to his brother, that he might feed her and\nthe children. They had had three sheep; but two had been sold to pay\nthe expenses of getting her husband off, and there was only some old\nrubbish left, she said, besides a sheep and two fowls. That was all she\nhad. Her mother-in-law confirmed her words.\n\nI asked the soldier\'s wife where she had come from. She came from\nSerg\xc3\xadevskoe. Serg\xc3\xadevskoe is a large, well-to-do village some thirty\nmiles off. I asked if her parents were alive. She said they were\nalive, and living comfortably.\n\n"Why should you not go to them?" I asked.\n\n"I thought of that myself, but am afraid they won\'t have the four of\nus."\n\n"Perhaps they will. Why not write to them? Shall I write for you?"\n\nThe woman agreed, and I noted down her parents\' address.\n\nWhile I was talking to the woman, the eldest child--a fat-bellied\ngirl--came up to her mother, and, pulling at her sleeve, began asking\nfor something, probably food. The woman went on talking to me, and paid\nno attention to the girl, who again pulled and muttered something.\n\n"There\'s no getting rid of you!" exclaimed the woman, and with a swing\nof her arm struck her on the head. The girl burst into a howl.\n\nHaving finished my business there, I left the hut and went back to the\nwidow.\n\nShe was outside her house, waiting for me, and again asked me to come\nand look at her calf. I went in, and in the passage there really was a\ncalf. The widow asked me to look at it. I did so, feeling that she was\nso engrossed in her calf that she could not imagine that anyone could\nhelp being interested in seeing it.\n\nHaving looked at the calf, I stepped inside, and asked:\n\n"Where is the old woman?"\n\n"The old woman?" the widow repeated, evidently surprised that after\nhaving seen the calf, I could still be interested in the old woman.\n"Why, on the top of the oven! Where else should she be?"\n\nI went up to the oven, and greeted the old woman.\n\n"Oh! ... oh!" answered a hoarse, feeble voice. "Who is it?"\n\nI told her, and asked how she was getting on.\n\n"What\'s my life worth?"\n\n"Are you in pain?"\n\n"Everything aches! Oh! ... oh!"\n\n"The doctor is here with me; shall I call him in?"\n\n"Doctor!... Oh! ... oh! What do I want with your doctor?... My doctor\nis up there.... Oh! ... oh!"\n\n"She\'s old, you know," said the widow.\n\n"Not older than I am," replied I.\n\n"Not older? Much older! People say she is ninety," said the widow. "All\nher hair has come out. I cut it all off the other day."\n\n"Why did you do that?"\n\n"Why, it had nearly all come out, so I cut it off!"\n\n"Oh! ... oh!" moaned the old woman; "oh! God has forgotten me! He does\nnot take my soul. If the Lord won\'t take it, it can\'t go of itself!\nOh! ... oh! It must be for my sins! ... I\'ve nothing to moisten my\nthroat.... If only I had a drop of tea to drink before I die.... Oh!\n... oh!"\n\nThe doctor entered the hut, and I said goodbye and went out into the\nstreet.\n\nWe got into the sledge, and drove to a small neighbouring village to\nsee the doctor\'s last patient, who had sent for him the day before. We\nwent into the hut together.\n\nThe room was small, but clean; in the middle of it a cradle hung\nfrom the ceiling, and a woman stood rocking it energetically. At the\ntable sat a girl of about eight, who gazed at us with surprised and\nfrightened eyes.\n\n"Where is he?" the doctor asked.\n\n"On the oven," replied the woman, not ceasing to rock the cradle.\n\nThe doctor climbed up, and, leaning over the patient, did something to\nhim.\n\nI drew nearer, and asked about the sick man\'s condition.\n\nThe doctor gave me no answer. I climbed up, too, and gazing through the\ndarkness gradually began to discern the hairy head of the man on the\noven-top. Heavy, stifling air hung about the sick man, who lay on his\nback. The doctor was holding his left hand to feel the pulse.\n\n"Is he very bad?" I asked.\n\nWithout answering me, the doctor turned to the woman.\n\n"Light a lamp," he said.\n\nShe called the girl, told her to rock the cradle, and went and lit a\nlamp and handed it to the doctor. I got down, so as not to be in his\nway. He took the lamp, and continued to examine the patient.\n\nThe little girl, staring at us, did not rock the cradle strongly\nenough, and the baby began to cry piercingly and piteously. The mother,\nhaving handed the lamp to the doctor, pushed the girl angrily aside and\nagain began to rock the cradle.\n\nI returned to the doctor, and again asked how the patient was. The\ndoctor, still occupied with the patient, softly whispered one word.\n\nI did not hear, and asked again.\n\n"The death-agony," he repeated, purposely using a non-Russian word, and\ngot down and placed the lamp on the table.\n\nThe baby did not cease crying in a piteous and angry voice.\n\n"What\'s that? Is he dead?" said the woman, as if she had understood the\nforeign word the doctor had used.\n\n"Not yet, but there is no hope!" replied he.\n\n"Then I must send for the priest," said the woman in a dissatisfied\nvoice, rocking the screaming baby more and more violently.\n\n"If only my husband was at home!... But now, who can I send? They\'ve\nall gone to the forest for firewood."\n\n"I can do nothing more here," said the doctor; and we went away.\n\nI heard afterwards that the woman found someone to send for the priest,\nwho had just time to administer the Sacrament to the dying man.\n\nWe drove home in silence, both, I think, experiencing the same feeling.\n\n"What was the matter with him?" I asked at length.\n\n"Inflammation of the lungs. I did not expect it to end so quickly. He\nhad a very strong constitution, but the conditions were deadly. With\n105 degrees of fever, he went and sat outside the hut, where there were\nonly 20 degrees."\n\nAgain we drove on in silence for a long time.\n\n"I noticed no bedding or pillow on the oven," said I.\n\n"Nothing!" replied the doctor. And, evidently knowing what I was\nthinking about, he went on:\n\n"Yesterday I was at Kroutoe to see a woman who has had a baby. To\nexamine her properly, as was necessary, she should have been placed so\nthat she could lie stretched out full length; but there was no place in\nthe whole hut where that could be done."\n\nAgain we were silent, and again we probably both had the same thoughts.\nWe reached home in silence. At the porch stood a fine pair of horses,\nharnessed tandem to a carpet-upholstered sledge. The handsome coachman\nwas dressed in a sheepskin coat, and wore a thick fur cap. They\nbelonged to my son, who had driven over from his estate.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd here we are sitting at the dinner-table, laid for ten persons. One\nof the places is empty. It is my little granddaughter\'s. She is not\nquite well to-day, and is having her dinner in her room with her nurse.\nA specially hygienic dinner has been prepared for her: beef-tea and\nsago.\n\nAt our big dinner of four courses, with two kinds of wine, served by\ntwo footmen, and eaten at a table decorated with flowers, this is the\nkind of talk that goes on:\n\n"Where do these splendid roses come from?" asks my son.\n\nMy wife tells him that a lady, who will not divulge her name, sends\nthem from Petersburg.\n\n"Roses like these cost three shillings each," says my son, and goes on\nto relate how at some concert or play such roses were showered on a\nperformer till they covered the stage. The conversation passes on to\nmusic, and then to a man who is a very good judge and patron of music.\n\n"By the by, how is he?"\n\n"Oh, he is always ailing. He is again going to Italy. He always spends\nthe winter there, and his health improves wonderfully."\n\n"But the journey is very trying and tedious."\n\n"Oh no! Not if one takes the express--it is only thirty-nine hours."\n\n"All the same, it is very dull."\n\n"Wait a bit! We shall fly before long!"\n\n\n                              _THIRD DAY_\n\n                                 TAXES\n\nBesides my ordinary visitors and applicants, there are to-day some\nspecial ones. The first is a childless old peasant who is ending his\nlife in great poverty. The second is a poor woman with a crowd of\nchildren. The third is, I believe, a well-to-do peasant.\n\nAll three have come from our village, and all have come about the\nsame business. The taxes are being collected before the New Year,\nand the old man\'s samov\xc3\xa1r, the woman\'s only sheep, and one of the\nwell-to-do peasant\'s cows, have been noted down for seizure in case of\nnon-payment. They all ask me to defend them or assist them, or to do\nboth.\n\nThe well-to-do peasant, a tall, handsome, elderly man, is the first to\nspeak. He tells me that the Village Elder came, noted down the cow,\nand demands twenty-seven roubles. This levy is for the obligatory\nGrain Reserve Fund, and ought not, the peasant thinks, to be collected\nat this time of year. I know nothing about it, and tell him that I\nwill inquire in the District Government Office, and will let him know\nwhether the payment of the tax can be postponed or not.\n\nThe second to speak is the old man whose samov\xc3\xa1r has been noted. The\nsmall, thin, weakly, poorly clad man relates, with pathetic grief and\nbewilderment, how they came, took his samov\xc3\xa1r, and demanded three\nroubles and seventy copecks of him, which he has not got and can\'t get.\n\nI ask him what the tax is for.\n\n"Some kind of Government tax.... Who can tell what it is? Where am\nI and my old woman to get the money? As it is, we hardly manage to\nlive!... What kind of laws are these? Have pity on our old age, and\nhelp us somehow!"\n\nI promise to inquire, and to do what I can, and I turn to the woman.\nShe is thin and worn-out. I know her, and know that her husband is a\ndrunkard, and that she has five children.\n\n"They have seized my sheep! They come and say: \'Pay the money!\' \'My\nhusband is away, working,\' I say. \'Pay up!\' say they. But where am I to\nfind it? I only had one sheep, and they are taking it!" And she begins\nto cry.\n\nI promise to find out, and to help her if I can. First, I go to the\nVillage Elder, to find out what the taxes are, and why they are\ncollecting them so rigorously.\n\nIn the village street, two other petitioners stop me. Their husbands\nare away at work. One asks me to buy some of her home-woven linen, and\noffers it for two roubles. "Because they have seized my hens! I had\njust reared them, and live by selling the eggs. Do buy it; it is good\nlinen! I would not let it go for three roubles if I were not in great\nneed!"\n\nI send her away, promising to consider matters when I return--perhaps I\nmay be able to arrange about the tax.\n\nBefore I reach the Elder\'s house, a woman comes to meet me: a\nquick-eyed, black-eyed ex-pupil of mine--\xc3\x93lga, now already an old\nwoman. She is in the same plight: they have seized her calf.\n\nI come to the Elder. He is a strong, intelligent-looking peasant, with\na grizzly beard. He comes out into the street to me. I ask him what\ntaxes are being collected, and why so rigorously. He replies that he\nhas had very strict orders to get in all arrears before the New Year.\n\n"Have you had orders to confiscate samov\xc3\xa1rs and cattle?"\n\n"Of course!" replies the Village Elder, shrugging his shoulders. "The\ntaxes must be paid.... Take Abako\xc3\xbamof now, for instance," said he,\nreferring to the well-to-do peasant whose cow had been taken in payment\nof some Grain Reserve Fund. "His son is an isv\xc3\xb3stchik: they have three\nhorses. Why shouldn\'t he pay? He\'s always trying to get out of it."\n\n"Well, suppose it so in his case," say I; "but how about those who are\nreally poor?" And I name the old man whose samov\xc3\xa1r they are taking.\n\n"Yes; they really are poor, and have nothing to pay with. But just as\nif such things get considered up there!"\n\nI name the woman whose sheep was taken. The Elder is sorry for her too,\nbut, as if excusing himself, explains that he must obey orders.\n\nI inquire how long he has been an Elder, and what pay he gets.\n\n"How much do I get?" he says, replying not to the question I ask, but\nto the question in my mind, which he guesses namely, why he takes part\nin such proceedings. "Well, I do want to resign! We get thirty roubles\na month, but are obliged to do things that are wrong."\n\n"Well, and will they really confiscate the samov\xc3\xa1rs and sheep and\nfowls?" I ask.\n\n"Why, of course! We are bound to take them, and the District Government\nwill arrange for their sale."\n\n"And will the things be sold?"\n\n"The folk will manage to pay up somehow."\n\nI go to the woman who came to me about her sheep. Her hut is tiny, and\nin the passage outside is her only sheep, which is to go to support the\nImperial Budget. Seeing me, she, a nervous woman worn out by want and\noverwork, begins to talk excitedly and rapidly, as peasant women do.\n\n"See how I live! They\'re taking my last sheep, and I myself and\nthese brats are barely alive!" She points up at the bunks and the\noven-top, where her children are. "Come down!... Now then, don\'t be\nfrightened!... There now, how\'s one to keep oneself and them naked\nbrats?"\n\nThe brats, almost literally naked, with nothing on but tattered\nshirts--not even any trousers--climb down from the oven and surround\ntheir mother.\n\nThe same day I go to the District Office, to make inquiries about this\nway of exacting taxation, which is new to me.\n\nThe District Elder is not in. He will be back soon. In the Office\nseveral persons are standing behind the grating, also waiting to see\nhim.\n\nI ask them who they are, and what they have come about. Two of them\nhave come to get passports, in order to be able to go out to work at\na distance. They have brought money to pay for the passports. Another\nhas come to get a copy of the District Court\'s decision rejecting\nhis petition that the homestead--where he has lived and worked for\ntwenty-three years, and which has belonged to his uncle, who adopted\nhim,--now that his uncle and aunt are dead, should not be taken from\nhim by his uncle\'s granddaughter. She, being the direct heiress,\nand taking advantage of the law of the 9th November, is selling the\nfreehold of the land and homestead on which the petitioner lived. His\npetition has been rejected, but he cannot believe that this is the law,\nand wants to appeal to some higher Court--though he does not know\nwhat Court. I explain that there is such a law, and this provokes\ndisapproval, amounting to perplexity and incredulity, among all those\nwho are present.\n\nHardly have I finished talking with this man, when a tall peasant with\na stern, severe face asks me for an explanation of his affairs. The\nbusiness he has come about is this: he and his fellow villagers have,\nfrom time immemorial, been getting iron ore from their land; and now a\ndecree has been published prohibiting this. "Not dig on one\'s own land?\nWhat laws are these? We only live by digging the iron! We have been\ntrying for more than a month, and can\'t get anything settled. We don\'t\nknow what to think of it; they\'ll ruin us completely, and that will be\nthe end of the matter!"\n\nI can say nothing comforting to this man, and turn to the Elder--who\nhas just come back--to inquire about the vigorous measures which are\nbeing taken to exact payment of arrears of taxation in our village. I\nask under what clauses of the Act the taxes are being levied. The Elder\ntells me that there are seven different kinds of rates and taxes, the\narrears of all of which are now being collected from the peasants:\n(1) the Imperial Taxes, (2) the Local Government Taxes, (3) the Insurance\nTaxes, (4) the arrears of Former Grain Reserve Funds, (5) New Grain\nReserve Funds in lieu of contributions in kind, (6) Communal and\nDistrict Taxes, and (7) Village Taxes.\n\nThe District Elder tells me, as the Village Elder had done, that the\ntaxes were being collected with special rigour by order of the higher\nauthorities. He admits that it is no easy task to collect the taxes\nfrom the poor, but he shows less sympathy than the Village Elder did.\nHe does not venture to censure the authorities; and, above all, he has\nhardly any doubt of the usefulness of his office, or of the rightness\nof taking part in such activity.\n\n"One can\'t, after all, encourage...."\n\nSoon after, I had occasion to talk about these things with a Z\xc3\xa9msky\nNatch\xc3\xa1lnik.[3] He had very little compassion for the hard lot of\nthe poverty-stricken folk whom he scarcely ever saw, and just as\nlittle doubt of the morality and lawfulness of his activity. In his\nconversation with me he admitted that, on the whole, it would be\npleasanter not to serve at all; but he considered himself a useful\nfunctionary, because other men in his place would do even worse things.\n"And once one is living in the country, why not take the salary, small\nas it is, of a Z\xc3\xa9msky Natch\xc3\xa1lnik?"\n\n       [3] A Z\xc3\xa9msky Natch\xc3\xa1lnik is a salaried official placed in\n       authority in a district. He is often selected from among the\n       local gentry, and wields very considerable authority.\n\nThe views of a Governor on the collection of taxes necessary to meet\nthe needs of those who are occupied in arranging for the nation\'s\nwelfare, were entirely free from any considerations as to samov\xc3\xa1rs,\nsheep, homespun linen, or calves taken from the poorest inhabitants of\nthe villages; and he had not the slightest doubt as to the usefulness\nof his activity.\n\nAnd finally, the Ministers and those who are busy managing the liquor\ntraffic, those who are occupied in teaching men to kill one another,\nand those who are engaged in condemning people to exile, to prison,\nto penal servitude, or to the gallows--all the Ministers and their\nassistants are quite convinced that samov\xc3\xa1rs and sheep and linen and\ncalves taken from beggars, are put to their best use in producing v\xc3\xb3dka\n(which poisons the people), weapons for killing men, the erection of\ngaols and lock-ups, and, among other things, in paying to them and to\ntheir assistants the salaries they require to furnish drawing-rooms, to\nbuy dresses for their wives, and for journeys and amusements which they\nundertake as relaxations after fulfilling their arduous labours for the\nwelfare of the coarse and ungrateful masses.\n\n\n                             _CONCLUSION_\n\n                                A DREAM\n\nA few nights ago I dreamt so significant a dream that several times\nduring the following day I asked myself, "What has happened to-day that\nis so specially important?" And then I remembered that the specially\nimportant thing was what I had seen, or rather heard, in my dream.\n\nIt was a speech that struck me greatly, spoken by one who, as often\nhappens in dreams, was a combination of two men: my old friend, now\ndead, Vlad\xc3\xadmir Orl\xc3\xb3f, with grey curls on each side of his bald head,\nand Nicholas Andr\xc3\xa9yevitch, a copyist who lived with my brother.\n\nThe speech was evoked by the conversation of a rich lady, the hostess,\nwith a landowner who was visiting her house. The lady had recounted how\nthe peasants on a neighbouring estate had burnt the landlord\'s house\nand several sheds which sheltered century-old cherry trees and duchesse\npears. Her visitor, the landowner, related how the peasants had cut\ndown some oaks in his forest, and had even carted away a stack of hay.\n\n"Neither arson nor robbery is considered a crime nowadays. The\nimmorality of our people is terrible: they have all become thieves!"\nsaid someone.\n\nAnd in answer to those words, that man, combined of two, spoke as\nfollows:\n\n"The peasants have stolen oaks and hay, and are thieves, and the most\nimmoral class," he began, addressing no one in particular. "Now, in\nthe Caucasus, a chieftain used to raid the Aouls and carry off all the\nhorses of the inhabitants. But one of them found means to get back from\nthe chieftain\'s herds at least one of the horses that had been stolen\nfrom him. Was that man a thief, because he got back one of the many\nhorses stolen from him? And is it not the same with the trees, the\ngrass, the hay, and all the rest of the things you say the peasants\nhave stolen from you? The earth is the Lord\'s, and common to all; and\nif the peasants have taken what was grown on the common land of which\nthey have been deprived, they have not stolen, but have only resumed\npossession of a small part of what has been stolen from them.\n\n"I know you consider land to be the property of the landlord, and\ntherefore call the restoration to themselves of its produce by the\npeasants--robbery; but, you know, that is not true! The land never was,\nand never can be, anyone\'s property. If a man has more of it than he\nrequires, while others have none, then he who possesses the surplus\nland possesses not land but men; and men cannot be the property of\nother men.\n\n"Because a dozen mischievous lads have burnt some cherry tree sheds,\nand have cut down some trees, you say the peasants are thieves, and the\nmost immoral class!...\n\n"How can your tongue frame such words! They have stolen ten oaks from\nyou. Stolen! \'To prison with them!\'\n\n"Why, if they had taken not your oaks alone but everything that is in\nthis house, they would only have taken what is theirs: made by them\nand their brothers, but certainly not by you! \'Stolen oaks!\' But for\nages you have been stealing from them, not oaks but their lives, and\nthe lives of their children, their womenfolk and their old men--who\nwithered away before their time--only because they were deprived of the\nland God gave to them in common with all men, and they were obliged to\nwork for you.\n\n"Only think of the life those millions of men have lived and are\nliving, and of how you live! Only consider what they do, supplying you\nwith all the comforts of life, and of what you do for them, depriving\nthem of everything--even of the possibility of supporting themselves\nand their families! All you live on--everything in this room,\neverything in this house, and in all your splendid cities, all your\npalaces, all your mad, literally mad, luxuries--has been made, and is\nstill continually being made, by them.\n\n"And they know this. They know that these parks of yours, and your\nrace-horses, motor cars, palaces, dainty dishes and finery, and all the\nnastiness and stupidity you call \'science\' and \'art\'--are purchased\nwith the lives of their brothers and sisters. They know and cannot help\nknowing this. Then think what feelings these people would have towards\nyou, if they were like you!\n\n"One would suppose that, knowing all you inflict on them, they could\nnot but hate you from the bottom of their souls, and could not help\nwishing to revenge themselves on you. And you know there are tens of\nmillions of them, and only some thousands of you. But what do they\ndo?... Why, instead of crushing you as useless and harmful reptiles,\nthey continue to repay your evil with good, and live their laborious\nand reasonable, though hard life, patiently biding the day when you\nwill become conscious of your sin and will amend your ways. But\ninstead of that, what do you do? From the height of your refined,\nself-confident immorality, you deign to stoop to those \'depraved,\ncoarse people.\' You enlighten them, and play the benefactor to them;\nthat is to say, with the means supplied to you by their labour, you\ninoculate them with your depravity, and blame, correct, and best of all\n\'punish\' them, as unreasoning or vicious infants bite the breasts that\nfeed them.\n\n"Yes, look at yourselves, and consider what you are and what they are!\nRealise that they alone live, while you, with your Do\xc3\xbamas, Ministries,\nSynods, Academies, Universities, Conservatoires, Law Courts, armies,\nand all such stupidities and nastinesses, are but playing at life, and\nspoiling it for yourselves and others. They, the people, are alive.\nThey are the tree, and you are harmful growths--fungi on the plant.\nRealise, then, all your insignificance and their grandeur! Understand\nyour sin, and try to repent, and at all costs set the people free...."\n\n"How well he speaks!" thought I. "Can it be a dream?"\n\nAnd as I thought that, I awoke.\n\nThis dream set me again thinking about the land question: a\nquestion of which those who live constantly in the country, among a\npoverty-stricken agricultural peasant population, cannot help thinking.\nI know I have often written about it; but under the influence of that\ndream, even at the risk of repeating myself, I once more felt the need\nto express myself. _Carthago delenda est._ As long as people\'s attitude\ntowards private property in land remains unchanged, the cruelty,\nmadness and evil of this form of the enslavement of some men by others,\ncannot be pointed out too frequently.\n\nPeople say that land is property, and they say this because the\nGovernment recognises private property in land. But fifty years ago the\nGovernment upheld private property in human beings; yet a time came\nwhen it was admitted that human beings cannot be private property,\nand the Government ceased to hold them to be property. So it will be\nwith property in land. The Government now upholds that property, and\nprotects it by its power; but a day will come when the Government will\ncease to acknowledge this kind of property, and will abolish it. The\nGovernment will have to abolish it, because private property in land\nis just such an injustice as property in men--serfdom--used to be. The\ndifference lies only in the fact that serfdom was a direct, definite\nslavery, while land-slavery is indirect and indefinite. Then Peter was\nJohn\'s slave, whereas now Peter is the slave of some person unknown,\nbut certainly of him who owns the land Peter requires in order to\nfeed himself and his family. And not only is land-slavery as unjust\nand cruel a slavery as serfdom used to be, it is even harder on the\nslaves, and more criminal on the part of the slave-holders. For under\nserfdom--if not from sympathy, then at least from self-interest--the\nowner was obliged to see to it that his serf did not wither away and\ndie of want, but to the best of his ability and understanding he looked\nafter his slaves\' morality. Now the landowner cares nothing if his\nlandless slave withers away or becomes demoralised; for he knows that\nhowever many men die or become depraved at his work, he will always be\nable to find workmen.\n\nThe injustice and cruelty of the new, present-day\nslavery--land-slavery--is so evident, and the condition of the slaves\nis everywhere so hard, that one would have expected this new slavery\nto have been recognised by this time as out of date, just as serfdom\nwas admittedly out of date half a century ago; and it should, one would\nhave thought, have been abolished, as serfdom was abolished.\n\n"But," it is said, "property in land cannot be abolished, for it\nwould be impossible to divide equally among all the labourers and\nnon-labourers the advantages given by land of different qualities."\n\nBut that is not true. To abolish property in land, no distribution of\nland is necessary.\n\nJust as, when serfdom was abolished, no distribution of the people\nliberated was necessary, but all that was needed was the abolition of\nthe law that upheld serfdom, so with the abolition of private property\nin land: no distribution of land is needed, but only the abolition of\nthe law sanctioning private property in land. And as when serfdom was\nabolished, the serfs of their own accord settled down as best suited\nthem, so when private property in land is abolished, people will find\na way of sharing the land among themselves so that all may have equal\nadvantage from it. How this will be arranged, whether by Henry George\'s\nSingle-Tax system, or in some other way, we cannot foresee. But it is\ncertain that the Government need only cease to uphold by force the\nobviously unjust and oppressive rights of property in land, and the\npeople, released from those restrictions, will always find means of\napportioning the land by common consent, in such a way that everyone\nwill have an equal share of the benefits the use of the land confers.\n\nIt is only necessary for the majority of land-owners--that is,\nslave-owners--to understand (as they did in the matter of serfdom)\nthat property in land is as hard on the present-day slaves, and as\ngreat an iniquity on the part of the slave-owners, as serfdom was; and,\nhaving understood that, it is only necessary for them to impress on the\nGovernment the necessity of repealing the laws sanctioning property in\nland--that is, land-slavery. One would have thought that, as in the\n\'fifties, the best members of society (chiefly the serf-owning nobles\nthemselves), having understood the criminality of their position,\nexplained to the Government the necessity for abolishing their\nevidently out-of-date and immoral rights, and serfdom was abolished,\nso it should be now with regard to private property in land, which is\nland-slavery.\n\nBut strange to say, the present slave-owners, the landed proprietors,\nnot only fail to see the criminality of their position, and do not\nimpress on the Government the necessity of abolishing land-slavery, but\non the contrary they consciously and unconsciously, by all manner of\nmeans, blind themselves and their slaves to the criminality of their\nposition.\n\nThe reasons of this are: first, that serfdom in the \'fifties, being\nthe plain, downright enslavement of man by man, ran too clearly\ncounter to religious and moral feeling; while land-slavery is not a\ndirect, immediate slavery, but is a form of slavery more hidden from\nthe slaves, and especially from the slave-owners, by complicated\ngovernmental, social and economic institutions. And the second reason\nis that, while in the days of serfdom only one class were slave-owners,\nall classes, except the most numerous one--consisting of peasants who\nhave too little land: labourers and working men--are slave-owners now.\nNowadays nobles, merchants, officials, manufacturers, professors,\nteachers, authors, musicians, painters, rich peasants, rich men\'s\nservants, well-paid artisans, electricians, mechanics, etc., are all\nslave-owners of the peasants who have insufficient land, and of the\nunskilled workmen who--apparently as a result of most varied causes,\nbut in reality as a result of one cause alone (the appropriation of\nland by the landed proprietors)--are obliged to give their labour and\neven their lives to those who possess the advantages land affords.\nThese two reasons--that the new slavery is less evident than the old,\nand that the new slave-owners are much more numerous than the old\nones--account for the fact that the slave-owners of our day do not see,\nand do not admit, the cruelty and criminality of their position, and do\nnot free themselves from it.\n\nThe slave-owners of our day not only do not admit that their position\nis criminal, and do not try to escape from it, but are quite sure that\nproperty in land is a necessary institution, essential to the social\norder, and that the wretched condition of the working classes--which\nthey cannot help noticing--results from most varied causes, but\ncertainly not from the recognition of some people\'s right to own land\nas private property.\n\nThis opinion of land-owning, and of the causes of the wretched\ncondition of the labourers, is so well established in all the leading\ncountries of the Christian world--France, England, Germany, America,\netc.--that with very rare exceptions it never occurs to their public\nmen to look in the right direction for the cause of the wretched\ncondition of the workers.\n\nThat is so in Europe and America; but one would have expected that\nfor us Russians, with our hundred million peasant population who deny\nthe principle of private ownership in land, and with our enormous\ntracts of land, and with the almost religious desire of our people for\nagricultural life, an answer very different to the general European\nanswer to questions as to the causes of the distress among the workers,\nand as to the means of bettering their position, would naturally\npresent itself.\n\nOne would think that we Russians might understand that if we really\nare concerned about, and desire to improve, the position of the\npeople and to free them from the aggravating and demoralising fetters\nwith which they are bound, the means to do this are indicated both\nby common-sense and by the voice of the people, and are simply--the\nabolition of private property in land, that is to say, the abolition of\nland-slavery.\n\nBut, strange to relate, in Russian society, occupied with questions\nof the improvement of the condition or the working classes, there is\nno suggestion of this one, natural, simple and self-evident means\nof improving their condition. We Russians, though our peasants\'\noutlook on the land question is probably centuries ahead of the rest\nof Europe, can devise nothing better for the improvement of our\npeople\'s condition than to establish among ourselves, on the European\nmodel, Do\xc3\xbamas, Councils, Ministries, Courts, Z\xc3\xa9mstvos, Universities,\nExtension Lectures, Academies, elementary schools, fleets, sub-marines,\nair-ships, and many other of the queerest things quite foreign to and\nunnecessary for the people, and we do not do the one thing that is\ndemanded by religion, morality, and common-sense, as well as by the\nwhole of the peasantry.\n\nNor is this all. While arranging the fate of our people, who do not\nand never did acknowledge land-ownership, we, imitating Europe, try in\nall sorts of cunning ways, and by deception, bribery, and even force,\nto accustom them to the idea of property in land--that is to say, we\ntry to deprave them and to destroy their consciousness of the truth\nthey have held for ages, and which sooner or later will certainly be\nacknowledged by the whole human race: the truth that all who live on\nthe earth cannot but have an equal right to its use.\n\nThese efforts to inoculate the people with the idea of landed\nproperty that is so foreign to them, are unceasingly made, with great\nperseverance and zeal by the Government, and consciously or for the\nmost part unconsciously, from an instinct of self-preservation, by all\nthe slave-holders of our time. And the slave-holders of our time are\nnot the land-owners alone, but are all those who, as a result of the\npeople being deprived of the land, enjoy power over them.\n\nMost strenuous efforts are made to deprave the people; but, thank God!\nit may be safely said that till now all those efforts have only had an\neffect on the smallest and worst part of Russia\'s peasant population.\nThe many-millioned majority of Russian workmen who hold but little\nland and live--not the depraved, parasitic life of the slave-owners,\nbut their own reasonable, hard-working lives--do not yield to those\nefforts; because for them the solution of the land question is not\none of personal advantage, as it is regarded by all the different\nslave-owners of to-day. For the enormous majority of peasants, the\nsolution of that problem is not arrived at by mutually contradictory\neconomic theories that spring up to-day and to-morrow are forgotten,\nbut is found in the one truth, which is realised by them, and always\nhas been and is realised by all reasonable men the world over,--the\ntruth that all men are brothers and have therefore all an equal right\nto all the blessings of the world and, among the rest, to the most\nnecessary of all rights--namely, the equal right of all to the use of\nthe land.\n\nLiving in this truth, an enormous majority of the peasants attach no\nimportance to all the wretched measures adopted by the Government\nabout this or that alteration of the laws of land-ownership, for they\nknow that there is only one solution to the land question--the total\nabolition of private property in land, and of land-slavery. And,\nknowing this, they quietly await their day, which sooner or later must\ncome.\n\n\n\n\n                        SINGING IN THE VILLAGE\n\n\nVoices and an accordion sounded as if close by, though through the mist\nnobody could be seen. It was a work-day morning, and I was surprised to\nhear music.\n\n"Oh, it\'s the recruits\' leave-taking," thought I, remembering that I\nhad heard something a few days before about five men being drawn from\nour village. Involuntarily attracted by the merry song, I went in the\ndirection whence it proceeded.\n\nAs I approached the singers, the sound of song and accordion suddenly\nstopped. The singers, that is the lads who were leave-taking, entered\nthe double-fronted brick cottage belonging to the father of one of\nthem. Before the door stood a small group of women, girls, and children.\n\nWhile I was finding out whose sons were going, and why they had entered\nthat cottage, the lads themselves, accompanied by their mothers and\nsisters, came out at the door. There were five of them: four bachelors\nand one married man. Our village is near the town where nearly all\nthese conscripts had worked. They were dressed town-fashion, evidently\nwearing their best clothes: peajackets, new caps, and high, showy\nboots. Conspicuous among them was a young fellow, well built though not\ntall, with a sweet, merry, expressive face, a small beard and moustache\njust beginning to sprout, and bright hazel eyes. As he came out, he at\nonce took a big, expensive-looking accordion that was hanging over his\nshoulders and, having bowed to me, started playing the merry tune of\n"B\xc3\xa1rynya," running his fingers nimbly over the keys and keeping exact\ntime, as he moved with rhythmic step jauntily down the road.\n\nBeside him walked a thick-set, fair-haired lad, also of medium height.\nHe looked gaily from side to side, and sang second with spirit, in\nharmony with the first singer. He was the married one. These two\nwalked ahead of the other three, who were also well dressed, and not\nremarkable in any way except that one of them was tall.\n\nTogether with the crowd I followed the lads. All their songs were\nmerry, and no expression of grief was heard while the procession was\ngoing along; but as soon as we came to the next house at which the\nlads were to be treated, the lamentations of the women began. It was\ndifficult to make out what they were saying; only a word here and there\ncould be distinguished: "death ... father and mother ... native land\n..."; and after every verse, the woman who led the chanting took a deep\nbreath, and burst out into long-drawn moans, followed by hysterical\nlaughter. The women were the mothers and sisters of the conscripts.\nBeside the lamentations of these relatives, one heard the admonitions\nof their friends.\n\n"Now then, Matry\xc3\xb3na, that\'s enough! You must be tired out," I heard one\nwoman say, consoling another who was lamenting.\n\nThe lads entered the cottage. I remained outside, talking with a\npeasant acquaintance, Vas\xc3\xadly Or\xc3\xa9hof, a former pupil of mine. His son,\none of the five, was the married man who had been singing second as he\nwent along.\n\n"Well," I said, "it is a pity!"\n\n"What\'s to be done? Pity or not, one has to serve."\n\nAnd he told me of his domestic affairs. He had three sons: the eldest\nwas living at home, the second was now being taken, and a third (who,\nlike the second, had gone away to work) was contributing dutifully to\nthe support of the home. The one who was leaving had evidently not sent\nhome much.\n\n"He has married a townswoman. His wife is not fit for our work. He is a\nlopped-off branch and thinks only of keeping himself. To be sure it\'s a\npity, but it can\'t be helped!"\n\nWhile we were talking, the lads came out into the street, and the\nlamentations, shrieks, laughter, and adjurations recommenced. After\nstanding about for some five minutes, the procession moved on with\nsongs and accordion accompaniment. One could not help marvelling at the\nenergy and spirit of the player, as he beat time accurately, stamped\nhis foot, stopped short, and then after a pause again took up the\nmelody most merrily, exactly on the right beat, while he gazed around\nwith his kind, hazel eyes. Evidently he had a real and great talent for\nmusic.\n\nI looked at him, and (so at least it seemed to me) he felt abashed when\nhe met my eyes, and with a twitch of his brows he turned away, and\nagain burst out with even more spirit than before. When we reached the\nfifth and last of the cottages, the lads entered, and I followed them.\nAll five of them were made to sit round a table covered with a cloth,\non which were bread and v\xc3\xb3dka. The host, the man I had been talking to,\nwho was now to take leave of his married son, poured out the v\xc3\xb3dka and\nhanded it round. The lads hardly drank at all (at most a quarter of a\nglass) or even handed it back after just raising it to their lips. The\nhostess cut some bread, and served slices round to eat with the v\xc3\xb3dka.\n\nWhile I was looking at the lads, a woman, dressed in clothes that\nseemed to me strange and incongruous, got down from the top of the\noven, close to where I sat. She wore a light green dress (silk, I\nthink) with fashionable trimmings, and high-heeled boots. Her fair hair\nwas arranged in quite the modern style, like a large round cap, and she\nwore big, ring-shaped, gold earrings. Her face was neither sad nor\ncheerful, but looked as if she were offended.\n\nAfter getting down, she went out into the passage, clattering with the\nheels of her new boots and paying no heed to the lads. All about this\nwoman--her clothing, the offended expression of her face, and above\nall her earrings--was so foreign to the surroundings that I could not\nunderstand how she had come to be on the top of Vas\xc3\xadly Or\xc3\xa9hof\'s oven. I\nasked a woman sitting near me who she was.\n\n"Vas\xc3\xadly\'s daughter-in-law; she has been a housemaid," was the answer.\n\nThe host began offering v\xc3\xb3dka a third time, but the lads refused, rose,\nsaid grace, thanked the hosts, and went out.\n\nIn the street, the lamentations recommenced at once. The first to raise\nher voice was a very old woman with a bent back. She lamented in such a\npeculiarly piteous voice, and wailed so, that the women kept soothing\nthe sobbing, staggering old creature, and supported her by her elbows.\n\n"Who is she?" I inquired.\n\n"Why, it\'s his granny; Vas\xc3\xadly\'s mother, that is."\n\nThe old woman burst into hysterical laughter and fell into the arms\nof the women who supported her, and just then the procession started\nagain, and again the accordion and the merry voices struck up their\ntune. At the end of the village the procession was overtaken by the\ncarts which were to carry the conscripts to the District Office. The\nweeping and wailing stopped. The accordion-player, getting more and\nmore elated, bending his head to one side and resting on one foot,\nturned out the toes of the other and stamped with it, while his fingers\nproduced brilliant _fioritures_, and exactly at the right instant\nthe bold, high, merry tones of his song, and the second of Vas\xc3\xadly\'s\nson, again chimed in. Old and young, and especially the children who\nsurrounded the crowd, and I with them, fixed their eyes admiringly on\nthe singer.\n\n"He is clever, the rascal!" said one of the peasants.\n\n"\'Sorrow weeps, and sorrow sings!\'" replied another.\n\nAt that moment one of the young fellows whom we were seeing off--the\ntall one--came up with long, energetic strides, and stooped to speak to\nthe one who played the accordion.\n\n"What a fine fellow," I thought; "they will put him in the Guards." I\ndid not know who he was or what house he belonged to.\n\n"Whose son is that one? That gallant fellow?" I asked a little old man,\npointing to the fine lad.\n\nThe old man raised his cap and bowed to me, but did not hear my\nquestion.\n\n"What did you say?" asked he.\n\nI had not recognised him, but as soon as he spoke I knew him at once.\nHe is a hard-working, good peasant who, as often happens, seems\nspecially marked out for misfortune: first, two horses were stolen from\nhim, then his house burnt down, and then his wife died. I had not seen\nProk\xc3\xb3fey for a long time, and remembered him as a bright red-haired man\nof medium height; whereas he was now not red, but quite grey-haired,\nand small.\n\n"Ah, Prok\xc3\xb3fey, it\'s you!" I said. "I was asking whose son that fine\nfellow is--that one who has just spoken to Alexander?"\n\n"That one?" Prok\xc3\xb3fey replied, pointing with a motion of his head to the\ntall lad. He shook his head and mumbled something I did not understand.\n\n"I\'m asking whose son the lad is?" I repeated, and turned to look at\nProk\xc3\xb3fey.\n\nHis face was puckered, and his jaw trembled.\n\n"He\'s mine!" he muttered, and, turning away and hiding his face in his\nhand, began to whimper like a child.\n\nAnd only then, after the two words, "He\'s mine!" spoken by Prok\xc3\xb3fey,\ndid I realise, not only in my mind but in my whole being, the horror of\nwhat was taking place before my eyes that memorable misty morning. All\nthe disjointed, incomprehensible, strange things I had seen suddenly\nacquired a simple, clear, and terrible significance. I became painfully\nashamed of having looked on as at an interesting spectacle. I stopped,\nconscious of having acted ill, and I turned to go home.\n\nAnd to think that these things are at the present moment being done\nto tens of thousands of men all over Russia, and have been done, and\nwill long continue to be done, to the meek, wise, and saintly Russian\npeople, who are so cruelly and treacherously deceived!\n\n\n\n\n                         TRAVELLER AND PEASANT\n\n\n  [_The interior of a peasant hut. An old Traveller is sitting on\n  a bench, reading a book. A Peasant, the master of the hut, just\n  home from his work, sits down to supper and asks the Traveller to\n  share it. The Traveller declines. The Peasant eats, and when he has\n  finished, rises, says grace, and sits down beside the old man._]\n\nPEASANT. What brings you?...\n\nTRAVELLER [_taking off his spectacles and putting down his book_].\nThere is no train till to-morrow. The station is crowded, so I asked\nyour missis to let me stay the night with you, and she allowed it.\n\nPEASANT. That\'s all right, you can stay.\n\nTRAVELLER. Thank you!... Well, and how are you living nowadays?\n\nPEASANT. Living? What\'s our life like?... As bad as can be!\n\nTRAVELLER. How\'s that?\n\nPEASANT. Why, because we\'ve nothing to live on! Our life is so hard\nthat if we wanted a worse one, we couldn\'t get it.... You see, there\nare nine of us in family; all want to eat, and I have only got in four\nbushels of corn. Try and live on that! Whether one likes it or not, one\nhas to go and work for wages ... and when you look for a job, wages\nare down!... The rich do what they like with us. The people increase,\nbut the land doesn\'t, and taxes keep piling up! There\'s rent, and the\ndistrict tax, and the land tax, and the tax for bridges, and insurance,\nand police, and for the corn store ... too many to count! And there are\nthe priests and the landlords.... They all ride on our backs, except\nthose who are too lazy!\n\nTRAVELLER. I thought the peasants were doing well nowadays.\n\nPEASANT. So well, that we go hungry for days at a time!\n\nTRAVELLER. The reason I thought so, was that they have taken to\nsquandering so much money.\n\nPEASANT. Squandering what money? How strange you talk!... Here are\npeople starving to death, and you talk of squandering money!\n\nTRAVELLER. But how is it? The papers say that 700 million roubles (and\na million is a thousand thousands)--700 million were spent by the\npeasants on v\xc3\xb3dka last year.\n\nPEASANT. Are we the only ones that drink? Just look at the priests....\nDon\'t they swill first-rate? And the gentlefolk aren\'t behind-hand!\n\nTRAVELLER. Still, that\'s only a small part. The greater part stills\nfalls to the peasants.\n\nPEASANT. What of that? Are we not to drink at all?\n\nTRAVELLER. No; what I mean is that if 700 millions were squandered on\nv\xc3\xb3dka in one year it shows that life can\'t be so very hard.... 700\nmillions! It\'s no joke ... one can hardly imagine it!\n\nPEASANT. But how can one do without it? We didn\'t start the custom,\nand it\'s not for us to stop it.... There are the Church feasts, and\nweddings, and memorial feasts, and bargains to be wetted with a\ndrink.... Whether one likes it or not, one can\'t get on without it.\nIt\'s the custom!\n\nTRAVELLER. But there are people who never drink, and yet they manage to\nlive! After all, there\'s not much good in it.\n\nPEASANT. No good at all! Only evil!\n\nTRAVELLER. Then one ought not to drink.\n\nPEASANT. Well, anyhow, drink or no drink, we\'ve nothing to live on!\nWe\'ve not enough land. If we had land we could at least live ... but\nthere\'s none to be had.\n\nTRAVELLER. No land to be had? Why, isn\'t there plenty of land? Wherever\none looks, one sees land!\n\nPEASANT. There\'s land, right enough, but it\'s not ours. Your elbow\'s\nnot far from your mouth, but just you try to bite it!\n\nTRAVELLER. Not yours! Whose is it, then?\n\nPEASANT. Whose?... Whose, indeed! There\'s that fat-bellied devil over\nthere ... he\'s seized 5000 acres. He has no family, but he\'s never\nsatisfied, while we\'ve had to give up keeping fowls--there\'s nowhere\nfor them to run about! It\'s nearly time for us to stop keeping cattle,\ntoo ... we\'ve no fodder for them; and if a calf, or maybe a horse,\nhappens to stray into his field, we have to pay fines and give him our\nlast farthing.\n\nTRAVELLER. What does he want all that land for?\n\nPEASANT. What does he want the land for? Why, of course, he sows and\nreaps and sells, and puts the money in the bank.\n\nTRAVELLER. How can he plough a stretch like that, and get his harvest\nin?\n\nPEASANT. You talk as if you were a child!... What\'s he got money for,\nif not to hire labourers?... It\'s they that do the ploughing and\nreaping.\n\nTRAVELLER. These labourers are some of you peasants, I expect?\n\nPEASANT. Some are from these parts, and some from elsewhere.\n\nTRAVELLER. Anyway, they are peasants?\n\nPEASANT. Of course they are!... the same as ourselves. Who but a\npeasant ever works? Of course they are peasants.\n\nTRAVELLER. And if the peasants did not go and work for him...?\n\nPEASANT. Go or stay, he wouldn\'t let us have it. If the land were to\nlie idle, he\'d not part with it! Like the dog in the manger, that\ndoesn\'t eat the hay himself and won\'t let others eat it!\n\nTRAVELLER. But how can he keep his land? I suppose it stretches over\nsome three or four miles? How can he watch it all?\n\nPEASANT. How queer you talk! He himself lies on his back, and fattens\nhis paunch; but he keeps watchmen!\n\nTRAVELLER. And those watchmen, I dare say, are also peasants?\n\nPEASANT. What else could they be? Of course they are!\n\nTRAVELLER. So that the peasants work the rich man\'s land for him, and\nguard it for him from themselves?\n\nPEASANT. But how can one help it?\n\nTRAVELLER. Simply by not going to work for him, and not being his\nwatchmen! Then the land would be free. The land is God\'s, and the\npeople are God\'s; let him who needs it, plough and sow and gather in\nthe harvest!\n\nPEASANT. That is to say, you think we ought to strike? To meet that,\nmy friend, they have the soldiers. They\'d send their soldiers ... one,\ntwo, fire!... some would get shot, and others taken up. Soldiers give\nshort shrift!\n\nTRAVELLER. But is it not also the likes of you that are soldiers? Why\nshould they shoot at their own fellows?\n\nPEASANT. How can they help it? That\'s what the oath is for.\n\nTRAVELLER. The oath? What oath?\n\nPEASANT. Don\'t you understand? Aren\'t you a Russian?... The oath\nis--well, it\'s the oath!\n\nTRAVELLER. It means swearing, doesn\'t it?\n\nPEASANT. Well, of course! They swear by the Cross and by the Gospels,\nto lay down their life for their country.\n\nTRAVELLER. Well, I think that should not be done.\n\nPEASANT. What should not be done?\n\nTRAVELLER. Taking the oath.\n\nPEASANT. Not done? Why, the law demands it!\n\nTRAVELLER. No, it is not in the Law. In the Law of Christ, it is\nplainly forbidden. He said: "Swear not at all."\n\nPEASANT. Come now! What about the priests?\n\nTRAVELLER [_takes a book, looks for the place, and reads_]: "It was\nsaid by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, _but I say\nunto you, Swear not at all_.... But let your speech be, Yea, yea; nay,\nnay: and whatsoever is more than these is of the evil one" (Matthew v.\n33). So, according to Christ\'s Law, you must not swear.\n\nPEASANT. If there were no oath, there would be no soldiers.\n\nTRAVELLER. Well, and what good are the soldiers?\n\nPEASANT. What good?... But supposing other Tsars were to come and\nattack our Tsar ... what then?\n\nTRAVELLER. If the Tsars quarrel, let them fight it out themselves.\n\nPEASANT. Come! How could that be possible?\n\nTRAVELLER. It\'s very simple. He that believes in God, no matter what\nyou may tell him, will never kill a man.\n\nPEASANT. Then why did the priest read out in church that war was\ndeclared, and the Reserves were to be ready?\n\nTRAVELLER. I know nothing about that; but I know that in the\nCommandments, in the Sixth, it says quite plainly: "Thou shalt do no\nmurder." You see, it is forbidden for a man to kill a man.\n\nPEASANT. That means, at home! At the wars, how could you help it?\nThey\'re enemies!\n\nTRAVELLER. According to Christ\'s Gospel, there is no such thing as an\nenemy. You are told to love everybody.\n\n                                [_Opens the Bible and looks for place._\n\nPEASANT. Well, read it!\n\nTRAVELLER. "Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou\nshalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the\njudgment.... Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt love thy\nneighbour, and hate thine enemy: but I say unto you, Love your enemies,\nand pray for them that persecute you" (Matthew v. 21, 43-44).\n\n                                                       [_A long pause._\n\nPEASANT. Well, but what about taxes? Ought we to refuse to pay them too?\n\nTRAVELLER. That\'s as you think best. If your own children are hungry,\nnaturally you should first feed them.\n\nPEASANT. So you think soldiers are not wanted at all?\n\nTRAVELLER. What good do they do? Millions and millions are collected\nfrom you and your folk for them--it\'s no joke to clothe and feed such\na host! There are nearly a million of those idlers, and they\'re only\nuseful to keep the land from you; and it is on you they will fire.\n\n                           [_The_ PEASANT _sighs, and shakes his head_.\n\nPEASANT. That\'s true enough! If everybody were to do it at once ... but\nif one or two make a stand, they\'ll be shot or sent to Siberia, and\nthat will be the end of the matter.\n\nTRAVELLER. And yet there are men, even now--young men--who by\nthemselves stand up for the Law of God, and refuse to serve. They say:\n"According to Christ\'s Law, I dare not be a murderer! Do as you please,\nbut I won\'t take a rifle in my hands!"\n\nPEASANT. Well, and what happens?\n\nTRAVELLER. They are put in prison; they remain there, poor fellows,\nthree years, or four.... But I\'ve heard that it\'s not so bad for them,\nfor the authorities themselves respect them. And some are even let out\nas unfit for service--bad health! Though he is sometimes a strapping,\nbroad-shouldered fellow, he\'s "not fit," because they\'re afraid\nof taking a man of that kind, for fear he should tell others that\nsoldiering is against God\'s Law. So they let him go.\n\nPEASANT. Really?\n\nTRAVELLER. Yes, sometimes it happens that they are let off; but it also\nhappens that they die there. Still, soldiers die too, and even get\nmaimed in service--lose a leg, or an arm....\n\nPEASANT. Oh, you\'re a clever fellow! It would be a good thing, only it\nwon\'t work out like that.\n\nTRAVELLER. Why not?\n\nPEASANT. _That\'s_ why.\n\nTRAVELLER. What\'s _that_?\n\nPEASANT. That the authorities have power given them.\n\nTRAVELLER. They only have power, because you obey them. Do not obey the\nauthorities, and they won\'t have any power!\n\nPEASANT. [_shakes his head_]. You do talk queer! How can one do without\nthe authorities? It is quite impossible to do without some authority.\n\nTRAVELLER. Of course it is! Only whom will you take for authority--the\npoliceman, or God? Whom will you obey--the policeman, or God?\n\nPEASANT. That goes without saying! No one is greater than God. To live\nfor God is the chief thing.\n\nTRAVELLER. Well, if you mean to live for God, you must obey God\nand not man. And if you live according to God, you will not drive\npeople off the land: you will not be a policeman, a village elder, a\ntax-collector, a watchman, or above all, a soldier.... You will not\npromise to kill men.\n\nPEASANT. And how about those long-maned fellows--the priests? They must\nsee that things are being done not according to God\'s Law. Then why\ndon\'t they teach how it ought to be?\n\nTRAVELLER. I don\'t know anything about that. Let them go their way, and\nyou go yours.\n\nPEASANT. They are long-maned devils!\n\nTRAVELLER. It\'s not right to judge others like that! We must each\nremember our own faults.\n\nPEASANT. Yes, that\'s right enough. [_Long pause. The_ PEASANT _shakes\nhis head, and smiles_.] What it comes to is this: that if we all were\nto tackle it at once, the land would be ours at one go, and there would\nbe no more taxes.\n\nTRAVELLER. No, friend, that\'s not what I mean. I don\'t mean that if we\nlive according to God\'s will, the land will be ours, and there will be\nno more taxes. I mean that our life is evil, only because we ourselves\ndo evil. If one lived according to God\'s will, life would not be evil.\nWhat our life would be like if we lived according to God\'s will, God\nalone knows; but certainly life would not be evil. We drink, scold,\nfight, go to law, envy, and hate men; we do not accept God\'s Law; we\njudge others; call one fat-paunched and another long-maned; but if\nany one offers us money, we are ready to do anything for it: go as\nwatchmen, policemen, or soldiers, to help ruin others, and to kill our\nown brothers. We ourselves live like devils, and yet we complain of\nothers!\n\nPEASANT. That\'s so! But it is hard, oh, how hard! Sometimes it\'s more\nthan one can bear.\n\nTRAVELLER. But, for our souls\' sakes, we must bear it.\n\nPEASANT. That\'s quite right.... We live badly, because we forget God.\n\nTRAVELLER. Yes, that\'s it! That\'s why life is evil. Take the\nRevolutionaries; they say: "Let\'s kill this or that squire, or these\nfat-paunched rich folk (it\'s all because of them); and then our life\nwill be happy." So they kill, and go on killing, and it profits them\nnothing. It\'s the same with the authorities: "Give us time!" they say,\n"and we\'ll hang, and do to death in the prisons, a thousand or a couple\nof thousand people, and then life will become good...." But it only\ngets worse and worse!\n\nPEASANT. Yes, that\'s just it! How can judging and punishing do any\ngood? It must be done according to God\'s Law.\n\nTRAVELLER. Yes, that is just it. You must serve either God or the\ndevil. If it\'s to be the devil, go and drink, scold, fight, hate,\ncovet, don\'t obey God\'s Law, but man\'s laws, and life will be evil. If\nit is God, obey Him alone. Don\'t rob or kill, and don\'t even condemn,\nand do not hate any one. Do not plunge into evil actions, and then\nthere will be no evil life.\n\nPEASANT [_sighs_]. You speak well, daddy, very well--only we are taught\nso little! Oh, if we were taught more like that, things would be quite\ndifferent! But people come from the town, and chatter about their way\nof bettering things: they chatter fine, but there\'s nothing in it....\nThank you, daddy, your words are good!... Well, where will you sleep?\nOn the oven, yes?... The missis will make up a bed for you.\n\n\n\n\n                        A TALK WITH A WAYFARER\n\n\nI have come out early. My soul feels light and joyful. It is a\nwonderful morning. The sun is only just appearing from behind the\ntrees. The dew glitters on them and on the grass. Everything is lovely;\neveryone is lovable. It is so beautiful that, as the saying has it,\n"One does not want to die." And, really, I do not want to die. I would\nwillingly live a little longer in this world with such beauty around\nme and such joy in my heart. That, however, is not my affair, but the\nMaster\'s....\n\nI approach the village. Before the first house I see a man standing,\nmotionless, sideways to me. He is evidently waiting for somebody or\nsomething, and waiting as only working people know how to wait, without\nimpatience or vexation. I draw nearer: he is a bearded, strong, healthy\npeasant, with shaggy, slightly grey hair, and a simple, worker\'s face.\nHe is smoking not a "cigar" twisted out of paper, but a short pipe. We\ngreet one another.\n\n"Where does old Alex\xc3\xa9y live?" I ask.\n\n"I don\'t know, friend; we are strangers here."\n\nNot "_I_ am a stranger," but "_we_ are strangers." A Russian is hardly\never alone. If he is doing something wrong, he may perhaps say "I";\notherwise it is always "we" the family, "we" the _art\xc3\xa9l_, "we" the\nCommune.\n\n"Strangers? Where do you come from?"\n\n"We are from Kalo\xc3\xbaga."\n\nI point to his pipe. "And how much do you spend a year on smoking?\nThree or more roubles, I daresay!"\n\n"Three? That would hardly be enough."\n\n"Why not give it up?"\n\n"How can one give it up when one\'s accustomed to it?"\n\n"I also used to smoke, but have given it up ... and I feel so well--so\nfree!"\n\n"Well of course ... but it\'s dull without it."\n\n"Give it up, and the dulness will go! Smoking is no good, you know!"\n\n"No good at all."\n\n"If it\'s no good, you should not do it. Seeing you smoke, others will\ndo the same ... especially the young folk. They\'ll say, \'If the old\nfolk smoke, God himself bids us do it!\'"\n\n"That\'s true enough."\n\n"And your son, seeing you smoke, will do it too."\n\n"Of course, my son too...."\n\n"Well then, give it up!"\n\n"I would, only it\'s so dull without it.... It\'s chiefly from dulness.\nWhen one feels dull, one has a smoke. That\'s where the mischief\nlies.... It\'s dull! At times it\'s so dull ... so dull ... so dull!"\ndrawled he.\n\n"The best remedy for that is to think of one\'s soul."\n\nHe threw a glance at me, and at once the expression of his face quite\nchanged: instead of his former kindly, humorous, lively and talkative\nexpression, he became attentive and serious.\n\n"\'Think of the soul ... of the soul,\' you say?" he asked, gazing\nquestioningly into my eyes.\n\n"Yes! When you think of the soul, you give up all foolish things."\n\nHis face lit up affectionately.\n\n"You are right, daddy! You say truly. To think of the soul is the\ngreat thing. The soul\'s the chief thing...." He paused. "Thank you,\ndaddy, it is quite true"; and he pointed to his pipe. "What is it?...\nGood-for-nothing rubbish! The soul\'s the chief thing!" repeated he.\n"What you say is true," and his face grew still kindlier and more\nserious.\n\nI wished to continue the conversation, but a lump rose in my throat (I\nhave grown very weak in the matter of tears), and I could not speak.\nWith a joyful, tender feeling I took leave of him, swallowing my tears,\nand I went away.\n\nYes, how can one help being joyful, living amid such people? How can\none help expecting from such people all that is most excellent?\n\n\n\n\n                            FROM THE DIARY\n\n\nI am again staying with my friend, Tchertk\xc3\xb3ff, in the Moscow\nGovernment, and am visiting him now for the same reason that once\ncaused us to meet on the border of the Orl\xc3\xb3f Government, and that\nbrought me to the Moscow Government a year ago. The reason is that\nTchertk\xc3\xb3ff is allowed to live anywhere in the whole world, except in\nTo\xc3\xbala Government. So I travel to different ends of it to see him.\n\nBefore eight o\'clock I go out for my usual walk. It is a hot day. At\nfirst I go along the hard clay road, past the acacia bushes already\npreparing to crack their pods and shed their seeds; then past the\nyellowing rye-field, with its still fresh and lovely cornflowers, and\ncome out into a black fallow field, now almost all ploughed up. To the\nright an old man, in rough peasant-boots, ploughs with a _soh\xc3\xa1_[4] and\na poor, skinny horse; and I hear an angry old voice shout: "Gee-up!"\nand, from time to time, "Now, you devil!" and again, "Gee-up, devil!" I\nwant to speak with him; but when I pass his furrow, he is at the other\nend of the field. I go on. There is another ploughman further on. This\none I shall probably meet when he reaches the road. If so, I\'ll speak\nto him, if there is a chance. And we do meet just as he reaches the\nroad.\n\n       [4] A primitive plough used by the peasants.\n\nHe ploughs with a proper plough, harnessed to a big roan horse, and\nis a well-built young lad, well clad, and wearing good boots; and he\nanswers my greeting of "God aid you!" pleasantly.\n\nThe plough does not cut into the hard, beaten track that crosses the\nfield, and he lifts it over and halts.\n\n"You find the plough better than a _soh\xc3\xa1_?"\n\n"Why, certainly ... much easier!"\n\n"Have you had it long?"\n\n"Not long--and it nearly got stolen...."\n\n"But you got it back?"\n\n"Yes! One of our own villagers had it."\n\n"Well, and did you have the law of him?"\n\n"Why, naturally!"\n\n"But why prosecute, if you got the plough back?"\n\n"Why, you see, he\'s a thief!"\n\n"What then? The man will go to prison, and learn to steal worse!"\n\nHe looks at me seriously and attentively, evidently neither agreeing\nnor contradicting this, to him, new idea.\n\nHe has a fresh, healthy, intelligent face, with hair just appearing on\nhis chin and upper lip, and with intelligent grey eyes.\n\nHe leaves the plough, evidently wishing to have a rest, and inclined\nfor a talk. I take the plough-handles, and touch the perspiring,\nwell-fed, full-grown mare. She presses her weight into her collar, and\nI take a few steps. But I do not manage the plough, the share jumps out\nof the furrow, and I stop the horse.\n\n"No, you can\'t do it."\n\n"I have only spoilt your furrow."\n\n"That doesn\'t matter--I\'ll put it right!"\n\nHe backs his horse, to plough the part I have missed, but does not go\non ploughing.\n\n"It is hot in the sun.... Let\'s go and sit under the bushes," says he,\npointing to a little wood just across the field.\n\nWe go into the shade of the young birches. He sits down on the ground,\nand I stop in front of him.\n\n"What village are you from?"\n\n"From Botv\xc3\xadnino."\n\n"Is that far?"\n\n"There it is, shimmering on the hill," says he, pointing.\n\n"Why are you ploughing so far from home?"\n\n"This is not my land: it belongs to a peasant here. I have hired myself\nout to him."\n\n"Hired yourself out for the whole summer?"\n\n"No--to plough this ground twice, and sow it, all properly."\n\n"Has he much land, then?"\n\n"Yes, he sows about fifteen bushels of seed."\n\n"Does he! And is that horse your own? It\'s a good horse."\n\n"Yes, it\'s not a bad mare," he answers, with quiet pride.\n\nThe mare really is, in build, size, and condition, such as a peasant\nrarely possesses.\n\n"I expect you are in service somewhere, and do carting?"\n\n"No, I live at home. I\'m my own master!"\n\n"What, so young?"\n\n"Yes! I was left fatherless at seven. My brother works at a Moscow\nfactory. At first my sister helped; she also worked at a factory. But\nsince I was fourteen I\'ve had no help in all my affairs, and have\nworked and earned," says he, with calm consciousness of his dignity.\n\n"Are you married?"\n\n"No."\n\n"Then, who does your housework?"\n\n"Why, mother!"\n\n"And you have a cow?"\n\n"Two cows."\n\n"Have you, really?... And how old are you?" I ask.\n\n"Eighteen," he replies, with a slight smile, understanding that it\ninterests me to see that so young a fellow has been able to manage so\nwell. This, evidently, pleases him.\n\n"How young you still are!" I say. "And will you have to go as a\nsoldier?"\n\n"Of course ... be conscripted!" says he, with the calm expression with\nwhich people speak of old age, death, and in general of things it is\nuseless to argue about, because they are unavoidable.\n\nAs always happens now when one speaks to peasants, our talk touches on\nthe land, and, describing his life, he says he has not enough land, and\nthat if he did not do wage-labour, sometimes with and sometimes without\nhis horse, he would not have anything to live on. But he says this with\nmerry, pleased and proud self-satisfaction; and again remarks that he\nwas left alone, master of the house, when he was fourteen, and has\nearned everything himself.\n\n"And do you drink v\xc3\xb3dka?"\n\nHe evidently does not like to say that he does, and still does not wish\nto tell a lie.\n\n"I do," he says, softly, shrugging his shoulders.\n\n"And can you read and write?"\n\n"Very well."\n\n"And haven\'t you read books about strong drink?"\n\n"No, I haven\'t."\n\n"Well, but wouldn\'t it be better not to drink at all?"\n\n"Of course. Little good comes of it."\n\n"Then why not give it up?"\n\nHe is silent, evidently understanding, and thinking it over.\n\n"It can be done, you know," say I, "and what a good thing it would\nbe!... The day before yesterday I went to \xc3\x8dvino. When I reached one of\nthe houses, the master came out to greet me, calling me by name. It\nturned out that we had met twelve years before.... It was Ko\xc3\xbazin--do\nyou know him?"\n\n"Of course I do! Serg\xc3\xa9y Timof\xc3\xa9evitch, you mean?"\n\nI tell him how we started a Temperance Society twelve years ago with\nKo\xc3\xbazin, who, though he used to drink, has quite given it up, and now\ntells me he is very glad to be rid of so nasty a habit; and, one sees,\nis living well, with his house and everything well managed, and who,\nhad he not given up drinking, would have had none of these things.\n\n"Yes, that is so!"\n\n"Well then, you know, you should do the same. You are such a nice, good\nlad.... What do you need v\xc3\xb3dka for, when you say yourself there is no\ngood in it?... You, too, should give it up!... It would be such a good\nthing!"\n\nHe remains silent, and looks at me intently. I prepare to go, and hold\nout my hand to him.\n\n"Truly, give it up from now! It would be such a good thing!"\n\nWith his strong hand he firmly presses mine, evidently regarding my\ngesture as challenging him to promise.\n\n"Very well then ... it can be done!" says he, quite unexpectedly, and\nin a joyous and resolute tone.\n\n"Do you really promise?" say I, surprised.\n\n"Well, of course! I promise," he says, nodding his head and smiling\nslightly.\n\nThe quiet tone of his voice, and his serious, attentive face, show that\nhe is not joking, but that he is really making a promise he means to\nkeep.\n\nOld age or illness, or both together, has made me very ready to cry\nwhen I am touched with joy. The simple words of that kindly, firm,\nstrong man, so evidently ready for all that is good, and standing so\nalone, touch me so that sobs rise to my throat, and I step aside,\nunable to utter a word.\n\nAfter going a few steps, I regain control of myself, and turn to him\nand say (I have already asked his name):\n\n"Mind, Alexander! ... the proverb says, \'Be slow to promise, but having\npromised, keep it!\'"\n\n"Yes, that\'s so. It will be safe."\n\nI have seldom experienced a more joyful feeling than I had when I left\nhim.\n\nI have omitted to say that during our talk I had offered to give him\nsome leaflets on drink and some booklets. [A man in a neighbouring\nvillage posted up one of those same leaflets on the wall outside his\nhouse lately, but it was pulled down and destroyed by the policeman.]\nHe thanked me, and said he would come and fetch them in the\ndinner-hour.\n\nHe did not come in the dinner-hour, and I, sinner that I am, suspected\nthat our whole conversation was not so important to him as it seemed\nto me, and that he did not want the books, and that, in general, I had\nattributed to him what was not in him. But he came in the evening, all\nperspiring from his work and from the walk. After finishing his work,\nhe had ridden home, put up the plough, attended to his horse, and had\nnow come a quarter of a mile to fetch the books.\n\nI was sitting, with some visitors, on a splendid veranda, looking out\non to flower-beds with ornamental vases on flower-set mounds--in short,\nin luxurious surroundings such as one is always ashamed of when one\nenters into human relations with working people.\n\nI went out to him, and at once asked, "Have you not changed your mind?\nWill you really keep your promise?"\n\nAnd again, with the same kindly smile, he replied, "Of course!... I\nhave already told mother. She\'s glad, and thanks you."\n\nI saw a bit of paper behind his ear.\n\n"You smoke?"\n\n"I do," he said, evidently expecting that I should begin persuading him\nto leave that off too. But I did not try to.\n\nHe remained silent; and then, by some strange connection of thoughts (I\nthink he saw the interest I felt in his life, and wished to tell me of\nthe important event awaiting him in the autumn) he said:\n\n"But I did not tell you.... I am already betrothed...."\n\nAnd he smiled, looking questioningly into my eyes. "It\'s to be in the\nautumn!"\n\n"Really! That\'s a good thing! Where is she from?"\n\nHe told me.\n\n"Has she a dowry?"\n\n"No; what dowry should she have? But she\'s a good girl."\n\nThe idea came to me to put to him the question which always interests\nme when I come in contact with good young people of our day.\n\n"Tell me," said I, "and forgive my asking--but please tell the truth:\neither do not answer at all, or tell the whole truth...."\n\nHe looked at me quietly and attentively.\n\n"Why should I not tell you?"\n\n"Have you ever sinned with a woman?"\n\nWithout a moment\'s hesitation, he replied simply:\n\n"God preserve me! There\'s been nothing of the sort!"\n\n"That\'s good, very good!" said I. "I am glad for you."\n\nThere was nothing more to say just then.\n\n"Well then, I will fetch you the books, and God\'s help be with you!"\n\nAnd we took leave of one another.\n\nYes, what a splendid, fertile soil on which to sow, and what a dreadful\nsin it is to cast upon it the seeds of falsehood, violence, drunkenness\nand profligacy!\n\n\n             OPEN ROAD PRESS, 3 AMEN CORNER, LONDON, E.C.\n\n\n\n\n                          The Free Age Press\n\n\n                        POPULAR PUBLICATIONS OF\n                             LEO TOLSTOY\'S\n                         AND KINDRED WRITINGS\n\n\n                 The following are all by Leo Tolstoy\n\n                     SIXPENNY SERIES (postage 1d.)\n    Also Cloth bound, 1s. net (postage 2d.), except those marked *\n\n  What is Religion?\n\n  What I Believe\n\n  On Life\n\n  The Kingdom of God is within You\n\n  What Shall We Do?\n\n  The Slavery of our Times\n\n  Popular Stories\n  First and Second Series, in 1 Volume\n\n  The Divine and the Human\n\n  A Murderer\'s Remorse\n\n  Tolstoy on Shakespeare*\n\n  Revolution in Russia*\n\n  War Album*\n\n  A Peace Album.

I regard them as the most perfect tales ever written.\n       In these popular stories a thought of the highest purity\n       reaches us, which to my mind is far more eloquent than the\n       subtlest forms. The highest art is given us, and it will\n       survive all times, like Dante, Shakespeare, the Bible, for\n       here is the Eternal Truth. It surprises me that people speak\n       more about the so-called greater works of Tolstoy than of\n       these little jewels, which are quite unique. If Tolstoy had\n       written nothing but these short stories, he would still have\n       belonged to the greatest men of the world. When writing them\n       he could not have had a base thought, must have been a friend\n       of suffering humanity, and a real Christian."\n\n\n                          THE FREE AGE PRESS\n              Editor: V.

Here is a sympathetic account of their sufferings while in\nprison or _en route_ to the place of exile, with a description of the\npsychological processes whereby a young revolutionist, condemned to\ndeath by hanging, is led to a full and satisfactory understanding of\nthe meaning of Life by reading the Beatitudes. There is an immediate\nresponse from within, and Svetlogoub endures the cross, forgives his\nmurderers, and dies with a smile on his face.\n\nAnother revolutionist, a materialist, becoming convinced of the\nstupidity of existence and the hopelessness of the struggle against\nreaction, commits suicide in his cell, while an old sectarian prisoner\ndies happily, invoking the Lamb of God.\n\nHere also is the story of a young Pole, who, on being banished to a\ndistant province, tries to escape, but is recaptured, sentenced to\nreceive "a thousand stripes," and finally sent to Siberia for life.\n\n\n                          THE FREE AGE PRESS\n              Editor: V.
