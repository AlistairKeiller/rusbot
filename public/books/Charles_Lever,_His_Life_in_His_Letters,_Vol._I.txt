Ernest Dupuy that \xe2\x80\x9cCount Leo N.\nTolsto\xc3\xaf was born on the 28th of August, 1828, at Yasnaya Polyana, a\nvillage near Inla, in the government of Inla,\xe2\x80\x9d I have a sense of lunar\nremoteness in him. It is as if these geographical expressions were\ndescriptive of localities in the ungazetteered regions of the moon; and\nyet this far-fetched Russian nobleman is precisely the human being with\nwhom at this moment I find myself in the greatest intimacy; not because\nI know him, but because I know myself through him; because he has\nwritten more faithfully of the life common to all men, the universal\nlife which is the most personal life, than any other author whom I have\nread. This merit the Russian novelists have each in some degree;\nTolsto\xc3\xaf has it in pre-eminent degree, and that is why the reading of\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace and War,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnna Karenina,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMy Religion,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cChildhood, Boyhood,\nand Youth,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cScenes at the Siege of Sebastopol,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Cossacks,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe\nDeath of Ivan Illitch,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cKatia,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cPolikouchka,\xe2\x80\x9d forms an epoch for\nthoughtful people. In these books you seem to come face to face with\nhuman nature for the first time in fiction. All other fiction at times\n_seems_ fiction; these alone seem the very truth always.\n\nThe facts of Tolsto\xc3\xaf\xe2\x80\x99s life, as one gathers them from the essays of M.\nDupuy and of M. Melchoir de Vogu\xc3\xab, are briefly that he studied Oriental\nlanguages and the law at the University of Kazan; then entered the army,\nserved in the Crimean war, resigned at its close; gave himself up to\nsociety and literature in St. Petersburg; and finally left the capital\nfor his estates, where he has since lived the life of lowly usefulness\nwhich he believes to be the true Christian life. The man whose career\nwas in camps, in courts, and in salons, now makes shoes for peasants,\nand humbly seeks to instruct them and guide them by the little tales he\nwrites for them in the intervals of his great work of newly translating\nthe gospels. He married the daughter of a German physician of Moscow,\nand his wife and children share his toils and ideals. Not much more is\nknown of the retirement of this very great man; but I heard that an\nAmerican traveller who lately passed a day with him found him steadfast\nin the conviction that withdrew him from society--the conviction that\nJesus Christ came into the world to teach men how to live in it, and\nthat He meant literally what He said when He forbade us luxury, war,\nlitigation, unchastity, and hypocrisy. His latest book, \xe2\x80\x9cQue Faire,\xe2\x80\x9d is\na relentlessly searching statement of the facts and reasons which forced\nthis conviction upon him.\n\nIt is a sorrowful comment on our Christianity that this frank acceptance\nof Christ\xe2\x80\x99s message seems eccentric and even mad to the world. But it is\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cincreasing purpose\xe2\x80\x9d which runs through all Tolsto\xc3\xaf\xe2\x80\x99s work from\nfirst to last; it is what makes him great above all others who have\nwritten fiction. It does not much matter where you begin with him; you\nfeel instantly that the man is mighty, and mighty through his\nconscience; that he is not trying to surprise or dazzle you with his\nart, but that he is trying to make you think clearly and feel rightly\nabout vital things with which \xe2\x80\x9cart\xe2\x80\x9d has often dealt with diabolical\nindifference or diabolical malevolence.\n\nI do not know how it is with others to whom these books of Tolsto\xc3\xaf\xe2\x80\x99s\nhave come, but for my own part I cannot think of them as literature in\nthe artistic sense at all. Some people complain to me, when I praise\nthem, that they are too long, too diffuse, too confused, that the\ncharacters\xe2\x80\x99 names are hard to pronounce, and that the life they portray\nis very sad and not amusing. In the presence of these criticisms I can\nonly say that I find them nothing of the kind, but that each history of\nTolsto\xc3\xaf\xe2\x80\x99s is as clear, as orderly, as brief, as something I have lived\nthrough myself; as for the names, they are necessarily Russian. It is\nwhen some one tells me they are \xe2\x80\x9cpessimistic\xe2\x80\x9d that I really despair. I\nhave always supposed pessimism to be the doctrine of the prevalence of\nevil, and these books perpetually teach me that the good prevails, and\nalways will prevail whenever men put self aside, and strive simply and\nhumbly to be good. We are all so besotted with dreams and vanities that\nwe have come to think that the right will accomplish itself\nspectacularly, splendidly; but Tolsto\xc3\xaf makes us know that it never can\ndo so. He teaches such of us as will hear him that the Right is the sum\nof each man\xe2\x80\x99s poor little personal effort to do right, and that the\nsuccess of this effort means daily, hourly self-renunciation,\nself-abasement, the sinking of one\xe2\x80\x99s pride in absolute squalor before\nduty. This is not pleasant; the heroic ideal of righteousness is more\npicturesque, more attractive; but is this not the truth? Let any one\ntry, and see! I cannot think of any service which imaginative literature\nhas done the race so great as that which Tolsto\xc3\xaf has done in his\nconception of Karenin at that crucial moment when the cruelly outraged\nman sees that he cannot be good with dignity. This leaves all tricks of\nfancy, all effects of art, immeasurably behind.\n\nIn fact, Tolsto\xc3\xaf brings us back in his fiction, as in his life, to the\nChrist ideal. \xe2\x80\x9cExcept ye become as little children\xe2\x80\x9d--that is what he\nsays in every part of his work; and this work, so incomparably good\n\xc3\xa6sthetically, to my thinking, is still greater ethically. You will not\nfind its lessons put at you, any more than you will those of life. No\nlittle traps are sprung for your surprise; no calcium light is thrown\nupon this climax or that; no virtue or vice is posed for you; but if you\nhave ears to hear or eyes to see, listen and look, and you will have the\nsense of inexhaustible significance.\n\nI happened to begin with \xe2\x80\x9cThe Cossacks\xe2\x80\x9d--that epic of nature, and of a\nyoung man\xe2\x80\x99s sorrowful, wandering desire to get into harmony with the\ndivine scheme of beneficence; then I read \xe2\x80\x9cAnna Karenina\xe2\x80\x9d--that most\ntragical history of loss and ruin to brilliancy and loveliness, out of\nwhich the good can alone save itself; then I came to \xe2\x80\x9cPeace and War,\xe2\x80\x9d\nthat great assertion of the sufficiency of common men in all crises, and\nthe insufficiency of heroes; I found some chapters of the \xe2\x80\x9cScenes at the\nSiege of Sebastopol,\xe2\x80\x9d and I read them with a yet keener sense of this\ntruth; \xe2\x80\x9cChildhood, Boyhood, and Youth\xe2\x80\x9d made me acquainted for the first\ntime in literature with the real heart of the young of our species; \xe2\x80\x9cThe\nDeath of Ivan Illitch\xe2\x80\x9d expressed the horror and the stress of mortality,\nwith its final bliss, and made it a part of Nature as I never had\nrealized it before; \xe2\x80\x9cPolikouchka,\xe2\x80\x9d slight, broken, almost unconcluded,\nwas perfect and powerful and infinite in its scope of mercy and\nsympathy.\n\nI know very well that I do not speak of these books in measured terms; I\ncannot. As yet my sense of obligation to them is so great that I neither\ncan make nor wish to make a close accounting with their author, and I am\nnot disposed to exploit them for the reader\xe2\x80\x99s entertainment. As often as\nI have tried to do this their \xc3\xa6sthetic interest has escaped me. I have\nbeen ashamed to tag them with the tattered old adjectives of praise, and\nI have found myself thinking of them on their ethical side. But they\nexist increasingly in English and in French, and the best way, the only\nway, to get a due sense of them is to read them.\n\n                                                         W. D. HOWELLS.\n\n\n\n\n\n                              SEBASTOPOL.\n\n\n\n\n_SEBASTOPOL IN DECEMBER, 1854._\n\n\nDawn tinges the horizon above Mount Sapoun\xc3\xa9; the shadows of the night\nhave left the surface of the sea, which, now dark blue in color, only\nawaits the first ray of sunshine to sparkle merrily; a cold wind blows\nfrom the fog-enveloped bay; there is no snow on the ground, the earth is\nblack, but frost stings the face and cracks underfoot. The quiet of the\nmorning is disturbed only by the incessant murmuring of the waves, and\nis broken at long intervals by the dull roar of cannon. All is silent on\nthe men-of-war; the hour-glass has just marked the eighth hour. Towards\nthe north the activity of day replaces little by little the tranquillity\nof night. On this side a detachment of soldiers is going to relieve the\nguard, and the click of their guns can be heard; a surgeon hurries\ntowards his hospital; a soldier crawls out of his hut, washes his\nsunburned face with icy water, turns towards the east, and repeats a\nprayer, making rapid signs of the cross. On that side an enormous, heavy\ncart with creaking wheels reaches the cemetery where they are going to\nbury the corpses heaped almost to the top of the vehicle. Approach the\nharbor and you are disagreeably surprised by a mixture of odors; you\nsmell coal, manure, moisture, meat. There are thousands of different\nobjects: wood, flour, gabions, beef, thrown in heaps here and there;\nsoldiers of different regiments, some provided with guns and with bags,\nothers with neither guns nor bags, crowd together; they smoke, they\nquarrel, and they bear loads upon the steamer stationed near the plank\nbridge and ready to sail. Small private boats, filled with all sorts of\npeople--soldiers, sailors, merchants, and women--are constantly arriving\nand departing. \xe2\x80\x9cThis way for Grafskaya!\xe2\x80\x9d and two or three retired\nsailors rise in their boats and offer you their services. You choose the\nnearest one, stride over the half-decomposed body of a black horse lying\nin the mud two steps from the boat, and seat yourself near the helm.\nYou push off from the shore; all around you the sea sparkles in the\nmorning sun; in front of you an old sailor in an overcoat of\ncamel\xe2\x80\x99s-hair cloth and a lad with blond hair are diligently rowing. You\nturn your eyes upon the gigantic ships with scratched hulls scattered\nover the harbor, upon the shallops,--black dots on the sparkling azure\nof the water--upon the pretty houses of the town, to whose light-colored\ntones the rising sun gives a rosy tinge, upon the hostile fleet standing\nlike light-houses in the crystalline distance of the sea, and, at last,\nupon the foaming waves, where play the salt drops which the oars dash\ninto the air. You hear at the same time the regular sound of voices\nwhich comes over the water, and the grand roar of the cannonade at\nSebastopol, which seems to increase in strength as you listen.\n\nAt the thought that you, you also, are in Sebastopol, your whole soul is\nfilled with a sentiment of pride and of valor, and your blood runs\nquicker in your veins.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStraight towards the _Constantine_, your excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d says the old\nsailor, turning around to the direction you are giving to the helm.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook! she has still got all her cannons,\xe2\x80\x9d remarks the lad with the\nblond hair as the boat glides along the side of the ship.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is quite new, she ought to have them. Korniloff lives on board,\xe2\x80\x9d\nrepeats the old man, examining in his turn the man-of-war.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere! it has burst!\xe2\x80\x9d cries the lad, after a long silence, his eyes\nfixed upon a small white cloud of drifting smoke suddenly appearing in\nthe sky above the south bay, and accompanied by the strident noise of a\nshell explosion.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are firing from the new battery to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d adds the sailor, calmly\nspitting in his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cCome along, Nichka; pull away. Let\xe2\x80\x99s pass the\nshallop.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the small boat moves rapidly over the undulating surface of the bay,\nleaves the heavy shallop behind laden with bags and with soldiers,\nunskilful rowers who are pulling awkwardly, and at last lands in the\nmiddle of a great number of boats moored to the shore in the harbor of\nGrafskaya. A crowd of soldiers in gray overcoats, sailors in black\njackets, and women in motley gowns comes and goes on the quay. Some\npeasants are selling bread; others, seated beside their samovars, offer\nto customers warm drink.\n\nHere, on the upper steps of the landing, are strewn about, pell-mell,\nrusty shot, shell, canister, cast-iron cannon of different calibres;\nthere, farther away, in a great open square, are lying enormous joists,\ngun-carriages, sleeping soldiers. On one side are wagons, horses,\ncannon, artillery caissons, stacks of muskets; farther on, soldiers,\nsailors, officers, women, and children are moving about; carts full of\nbread, bags, and barrels, a Cossack on horseback, a general in his\ndroschky, are crossing the square. A barricade looms up in the street to\nthe right, and in its embrasures are small cannon, beside which a sailor\nis sitting quietly smoking his pipe. On the left stands a pretty house,\non the pediment of which are scrawled numerals, and above can be seen\nsoldiers and blood-stained stretchers. The dismal traces of a camp in\nwar-time meet the eye everywhere. Your first impression is, doubtless, a\ndisagreeable one; the strange amalgamation of town life with camp life,\nof an elegant city and a dirty bivouac, strikes you like a hideous\nincongruity. It seems to you that all, overcome by terror, are acting\nvacuously; but if you examine the faces of those men who are moving\nabout you, you will think differently. Look well at this soldier of the\nwagon-train who is leading his bay troitka horses to drink, humming\nthrough his teeth, and you shall find that he does not go astray in this\nconfused crowd, which in fact does not exist for him, for he is full of\nhis own business, and will do his duty, whatever it is--will lead his\nhorses to the watering-place or drag a cannon with as much calm and\nassured indifference as if he were at Toula or at Saransk. You notice\nthe same expression on the face of this officer, with his irreproachable\nwhite gloves, who is passing before you, of that sailor who sits on the\nbarricade smoking, of the soldiers who wait with their stretchers at the\ndoor of what was lately the Assembly Hall, even upon the face of the\nyoung girl who crosses the street, leaping from stone to stone for fear\nof soiling her pink dress. Yes, a great deception awaits you on your\narrival at Sebastopol. In vain you seek to discover upon any face\ntraces of agitation, fright, indeed even enthusiasm, resignation to\ndeath, resolution; there is nothing of all that. You see the course of\nevery-day life; see people occupied with their daily toils, so that, in\nfact, you blame yourself for your exaggerated exaltation, and doubt not\nonly the truth of the opinion you have formed from hearsay about the\nheroism of the defenders of Sebastopol, but also doubt the accuracy of\nthe description which has been given you on the north side and the\nsinister sounds which fill the air there. Before doubting, however, go\nup to a bastion, see the defenders of Sebastopol on the very place of\nthe defence, or rather enter straight into this house at whose door\nstand the stretcher-bearers. You will see there the heroes of the army,\nyou will see there horrible and heart-rending sights, both sublime and\ncomic, but wonderful and of a soul-elevating nature. Enter this great\nhall, which before the war was the hall of the Assembly. Scarcely have\nyou opened the door before the odor exhaled from forty or fifty\namputations and severe wounds turns you sick. You must not yield to the\nfeeling which keeps you on the threshold of the room, it is an unworthy\nfeeling; go boldly in, and not blush at having come to look at these\nmartyrs. You may approach and speak with them. The wretches like to see\na pitying face, to relate their sufferings, and to hear words of charity\nand sympathy. Passing down the middle between the beds, you look for the\nface which is the least rigid, the least contracted by pain, and on\nfinding it decide to go near and put a question.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you wounded?\xe2\x80\x9d you hesitatingly ask an old, emaciated soldier,\nseated on his bed, watching you with a kindly look, and apparently\ninviting you to approach. You have, I say, put this question\nhesitatingly, because the sight of the sufferer inspires not only a\nlively pity, but also a sort of dread of hurting his feelings, joined\nwith a profound respect.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the foot,\xe2\x80\x9d replies the soldier; and nevertheless you notice by the\nfolds of the blanket that his leg has been cut off above the knee.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod be praised!\xe2\x80\x9d he adds, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be discharged.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you wounded long since?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the sixth week, your excellency.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you feel badly now?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNowhere only in my calf when it is bad weather; nothing but that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did it happen?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the fifth bastion, your excellency, in the first bombardment. I had\njust sighted the cannon, and was going quietly to the other embrasure,\nwhen suddenly something struck my foot. I thought I had fallen into a\nhole. I looked--my leg was gone!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any pain at first, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone at all, only just as if I had scalded my leg; that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd afterwards?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone afterwards, only when they stretched the skin; that was a little\nrough. First of all things, your excellency, we mustn\xe2\x80\x99t think. When we\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think we don\xe2\x80\x99t feel. When a man thinks, it is the worse for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMeanwhile, a woman dressed in gray, with a black kerchief tied around\nher head, approaches, joins in the conversation, and begins to give a\ndetailed account of the sailor: how he has suffered, how his life was\ndespaired of for four weeks, how, when wounded, he made them stop the\nstretcher on which he was being carried to the rear in order to watch\nthe discharge of our battery, and how the grand-dukes had spoken with\nhim, had given him twenty-five rubles, and how he had replied that, not\nbeing able to serve any more himself, he would like to come back to the\nbastion to train the conscripts. The good woman, her eyes sparkling with\nenthusiasm, relates this in one breath, looking at you and then at the\nsailor, who turns away and pretends not to hear, busy with picking lint\nfrom his pillow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my wife, your excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d says the sailor at last, with an\nintonation of voice which seems to say, \xe2\x80\x9cYou must excuse her; all that\nis woman\xe2\x80\x99s foolish prattle, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nYou then begin to understand what the defenders of Sebastopol are, and\nyou are ashamed of yourself in the presence of this man. You would have\nliked to express all your admiration for him, all your sympathy, but the\nwords will not come, or those which do come are worthless, and you can\nonly bow in silence before this unconscious grandeur, before this\nfirmness of soul and this exquisite shame of his own merit.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well, may God speedily cure you!\xe2\x80\x9d you say, and you stop before\nanother wounded man lying on the floor, who, suffering horrible pain,\nseems to be awaiting his death. He is blond, and his pale face is much\nswollen. Stretched on his back, his left hand thrown up, his position\nindicates acute suffering. His hissing breath escapes with difficulty\nfrom his dry, half-open mouth. The glassy blue pupils of his eyes are\nrolled up under the eyelids, and a mutilated arm, wrapped in bandages,\nsticks out from under the tumbled blanket. A nauseating, corpse-like\nodor rises to your nostrils, and the fever which burns the sufferer\xe2\x80\x99s\nlimbs seems to penetrate your own body.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he unconscious?\xe2\x80\x9d you ask of the woman who kindly accompanies you,\nand to whom you are no longer a stranger.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; he can still hear, but he is very bad;\xe2\x80\x9d and she adds, under her\nbreath, \xe2\x80\x9cI have just made him drink a little tea. He is nothing to me,\nonly I have pity on him; indeed, he has only been able to swallow a few\nmouthfuls.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you feel?\xe2\x80\x9d you ask him.\n\nAt the sound of your voice the wounded man\xe2\x80\x99s eyes turn towards you, but\nhe neither sees nor understands.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat burns my heart!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmurs.\n\nA little farther on an old soldier is changing his clothes. His face and\nhis body are both of the same brown color, and as thin as a skeleton.\nOne of his arms has been amputated at the shoulder. He is seated on his\nbed, he is out of danger, but from his dull, lifeless look, from his\nfrightful thinness, from his wrinkled face, you see that this creature\nhas already passed the greater part of his existence in suffering.\n\nOn the opposite bed you see the pale, delicate, pain-shrivelled face of\na woman whose cheeks are flushed with fever.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a sailor\xe2\x80\x99s wife. A shell hit her on the foot while she was\ncarrying dinner to her husband in the bastion,\xe2\x80\x9d says the guide.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas it been amputated?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbove the knee.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNow, if your nerves are strong, enter there at the left. It is the\noperating-room. There you see surgeons with pale and serious\ncountenances, their arms blood-splashed to the elbows, beside the bed\nof a wounded man, who, stretched on his back with open eyes, is\ndelirious under the influence of chloroform, and utters broken phrases,\nsome unimportant, some touching. The surgeons are busy with their\nrepulsive but beneficent task, amputation. You see the curved and keen\nblade penetrate the healthy white flesh. The wounded man suddenly comes\nto himself with heart-rending cries, with curses. The assistant surgeon\nthrows the arm into a corner, while another wounded man on a stretcher\nwho sees the operation turns and groans, more on account of the mental\ntorture of expectation than from the physical pain he feels. You will\nwitness these horrible, heart-rending scenes; you will see war without\nthe brilliant and accurate alignment of troops, without music, without\nthe drum-roll, without standards flying in the wind, without galloping\ngenerals--you will see it as it is, in blood, in suffering, and in\ndeath! Leaving this house of pain, you will experience a certain\nimpression of well-being, you will take long breaths of fresh air, and\nwill be glad to feel yourself in good health; but at the same time the\ncontemplation of these misfortunes will have convinced you of your own\ninsignificance, and you will go up into a bastion without hesitation.\nWhat are the sufferings and the death of an atom like me, you will ask\nyourself, in comparison with these innumerable sufferings and deaths?\nBesides, in a short time the sight of the pure sky, of the bright sun,\nof the pretty city, of the open church, of the soldiers coming and going\nin all directions, raises your spirits to their normal state. Habitual\nindifference, preoccupation with the present and with its petty\ninterests, resume the ascendant. Perhaps you will meet on your way the\nfuneral cortege of an officer--a red coffin followed by a band and by\nunfurled standards--and perhaps the roar of the cannonade on the bastion\nwill strike your ear, but your thoughts of a few moments before will not\ncome back again. The funeral will only be a pretty picture for you, the\ngrowl of the cannon a grand military accompaniment, and there will be\nnothing in common between this picture, these sounds, and the clear,\npersonal impression of suffering and death called up by the sight of the\noperating-room.\n\nPass the church, the barricade, and you enter the most animated, the\nliveliest quarter of the city. On both sides of the street are shop\nsigns, eating-house signs. Here are merchants, women with men\xe2\x80\x99s hats or\nwith handkerchiefs on their heads, officers in elegant uniforms.\nEverything testifies to the courage, the assurance, the safety of the\ninhabitants.\n\nEnter this restaurant on the right. If you want to listen to the\nsailors\xe2\x80\x99 and the officers\xe2\x80\x99 talk, you will hear them relate the incidents\nof the night before, of the affair of the 24th; hear them grumble at the\nhigh price of the badly cooked cutlets, and mention the comrade recently\nkilled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDevil take me! we are badly off where we are now,\xe2\x80\x9d says the bass voice\nof a pale, blond, beardless, newly appointed officer, his neck wrapped\nin a green knit scarf.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is that?\xe2\x80\x9d some one asks.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the fourth bastion,\xe2\x80\x9d replies the young officer; and at this reply\nyou attentively look at him, and feel a certain respect for him. His\nexaggerated carelessness, his violent gestures, his too loud laughter,\nwhich would shortly before have seemed to you impudent, become in your\neyes the index of a certain kind of combative spirit common to all\nyoung people who are exposed to great danger, and you are sure he is\ngoing to explain that it is on account of the shells and the bullets\nthat they are so badly off in the fourth bastion. Nothing of the kind!\nThey are badly off there because the mud is deep.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible to get up to the battery,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, pointing to his boots,\nmuddied even to the upper-leathers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy best gun captain was instantly killed to-day by a ball in his\nforehead,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoins a comrade.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was it? Mituchine?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, another man.--Look here! are you never going to bring me my chop,\nyou villain?\xe2\x80\x9d says he, speaking to the waiter.--\xe2\x80\x9cIt was Abrossinoff, as\nbrave a man as lived. He took part in six sorties.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt the other end of the table two infantry officers are eating veal\ncutlets with green pease washed down by sour Crimean wine, by courtesy\ncalled Bordeaux. One of them, a young man with red collar and two stars\non his coat, is telling to his neighbor with a black collar and no stars\nthe details of the fight on the Alma. The first is a little the worse\nfor liquor. His frequently interrupted tale, his uncertain look, which\nreflects the lack of confidence which his story inspires in his auditor,\nthe fine part he gives himself, the too high color of his picture, lead\nyou to guess that he is wandering away from the absolute truth. But you\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t anything to do with these tales, which you will hear for a long\ntime yet in the farthest corners of Russia; you have one wish alone,\nthat is, to go straight to the fourth bastion, which you have heard so\nmany and so varied reports about. You will notice that whoever tells you\nhe has been there says it with pride and satisfaction; that whoever is\ngetting ready to go there either shows a little emotion or affects an\nexaggerated _sangfroid_. If one man is joking with another, he will\ninvariably tell him, \xe2\x80\x9cGo to the fourth bastion!\xe2\x80\x9d If a wounded man on a\nstretcher is met, and he is asked where he comes from, he will answer,\nalmost without fail, \xe2\x80\x9cFrom the fourth bastion!\xe2\x80\x9d Two completely different\nnotions of this terrible earthwork have been circulated; the first by\nthose who have never put their foot upon it, and for whom it is the\ninevitable tomb of its defenders, the second by those who, like the\nlittle blond officer, live there and simply speak of it, saying it is\ndry or muddy there, warm or cold.\n\nDuring the half hour you have been in the restaurant the weather has\nchanged and the fog which spread over the sea has risen. Thick, gray,\nmoist clouds hide the sun. The sky is gloomy, and a fine rain mixed with\nsnow is falling, wetting the roofs, the sidewalks, and the soldiers\xe2\x80\x99\novercoats. After passing one more barricade you go along up the broad\nstreet. There are no more shop-signs; the houses are uninhabitable, the\ndoors fastened up with boards, the windows broken. On this side the\ncorner of a wall has been carried away, on that side the roof has been\nbroken in. The buildings look like old veterans tried by grief and\nmisery, and stare at you with pride, one might say with disdain even. On\nthe way you stumble over cannon-balls and into holes, filled with water,\nwhich the shells have made in the rocky ground. You pass detachments of\nsoldiers and officers. You occasionally meet a woman or a child, but\nhere the woman does not wear a hat. As for the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s wife, she wears\nan old fur cloak, and has soldiers\xe2\x80\x99 boots on her feet. The street now\nleads down a gentle declivity, but there are no more houses around you,\nnothing but shapeless masses of stones, of boards, of beams, and of\nclay. Before you, on a steep hill, stretches a black space, all muddy,\nand cut up with ditches. What you are looking at is the fourth bastion.\n\nPassers become rare, no more women are met. The soldiers walk with rapid\nstep. A few drops of blood stain the path, and you see coming towards\nyou four soldiers bearing a stretcher, and on the stretcher a face of a\nsallow paleness and a bloody coat. If you ask the bearers where he is\nwounded, they will reply, with an irritated tone, without looking at\nyou, that he has been hit on the arm or on the leg. If his head has been\ncarried away, if he is dead, they will keep a morose silence.\n\nThe near whiz of balls and shells gives you a disagreeable impression\nwhile you are climbing the hill, and suddenly you have an entirely\ndifferent idea from the one you recently had of the meaning of the\ncannon-shots heard in the city. I do not know what placid and sweet\nsouvenir will suddenly shine out in your memory. Your intimate _ego_\nwill occupy you so actively that you will no longer think of noticing\nyour surroundings. You will permit yourself to be overcome by a painful\nfeeling of irresolution. However, the sight of a soldier who, with\nextended arms, is slipping down the hill in the liquid mud, and passes\nnear you, running and laughing, silences your small inward voice, the\ncowardly counsellor which arises in you in the presence of danger. You\nstraighten up in spite of yourself, you raise your head, and you, in\nyour turn, scale the slippery slope of the clay hill. You have scarcely\ngone a step before musket-balls hum in your ears, and you ask yourself\nif it would not be preferable to go under cover of the trench thrown up\nparallel with the path. But the trench is full of a yellow, fetid,\nliquid mud, so that you are obliged to go on in the path; all the more\nsince it is the way everybody goes. At the end of two hundred paces you\ncome out on a place surrounded by gabions, embankments, shelters,\nplatforms supporting enormous cast-iron cannon, and heaps of\nsymmetrically piled cannon-balls. These heaps of things give you the\nimpression of a strange and aimless disorder. Here on the battery\nassembles a group of sailors; there in the middle of the enclosure lies\na dismounted cannon, half buried in the sticky mud, through which an\ninfantryman, musket in hand, is going to the battery, pulling out with\ndifficulty first one foot and then the other. Everywhere in this liquid\nmud you see broken glass, unexploded shells, cannon-balls--every trace\nof camp life. You seem to hear the noise of a cannon-ball falling only\ntwo yards away, and from all sides come the sound of balls, which\nsometimes hum like bees, sometimes groan and split the air, which\nvibrates like a violin-string, the whole dominated by the sinister\nrumbling of cannon, which shakes you from head to foot and fills you\nwith terror.\n\nThis is, then, the fourth bastion, this really terrible place, you say\nto yourself, feeling a little pride and a great deal of repressed fear.\nNot at all! You are the sport of an illusion. This is not yet the fourth\nbastion; it is the Jason redoubt, a place which, comparatively, is\nneither dangerous nor frightful. In order to reach the fourth bastion\nyou enter the narrow trench which the infantryman follows, stooping\nover. You will perhaps see more stretchers, sailors, soldiers with\nspades, wires leading to the mines, earth-shelters equally muddy, into\nwhich only two men can crawl, and where the battalions of the Black Sea\nSharpshooters live, eat, smoke, and put their boots on and off, in the\nmidst of the d\xc3\xa9bris of cast-iron of every form thrown here and there.\nYou will perhaps find here four or five sailors playing cards in the\nshelter of the parapet, and a naval officer, who, seeing a new face come\nup, and a spectator at that, will be really pleased to initiate you into\nthe details of the arrangements and give you an explanation of them.\nThis officer, seated on a cannon, is rolling a cigarette with such\ncoolness, passes so quietly from one embrasure to another, and talks\nwith you with such natural calmness, that you recover your own\n_sangfroid_, in spite of the balls which are whistling here in greater\nnumbers. You ask him questions, and even listen to his tales. The sailor\nwill describe to you, if you will only ask him, the bombardment of the\n5th, the state of his battery with a single serviceable cannon, his men\nreduced to eight, and, moreover, on the morning of the 6th, the battery\nfired with every gun. He will tell you also how, on the 5th, a shell\npenetrated a bomb-proof and struck down eleven sailors. He will show\nyou, through the embrasure, the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s trenches and batteries, which\nare only thirty or forty fathoms distant. I fear, however, that, leaning\nout of the embrasure in order to examine the enemy better, you will see\nnothing, or that, if you perceive something, you will be very much\nsurprised to learn that this white and rocky rampart a few steps away,\nand from which are spouting little clouds of smoke, is really the\nenemy--\xe2\x80\x9c_him_,\xe2\x80\x9d as the soldiers and sailors say.\n\nIt is very possible that the officer, either through vanity or simply,\nwithout reflection, to amuse himself, will be willing to have them fire\nfor you. At his order the captain of the gun and the men, fourteen\nsailors all told, gayly approach the cannon to load it, some chewing\nbiscuit, others cramming their short pipes in their pockets, while their\nhobnailed shoes clatter on the platform. Notice the faces of these men,\ntheir bearing, their movements, and you will recognize in each of the\nwrinkles of their sunburned faces with high cheek-bones, in each muscle,\nin the breadth of the shoulders, in the thickness of the feet shod with\ncolossal boots, in each calm and bold gesture, the principal elements\nthat make up the strength of Russia--simplicity and obstinacy. You will\nalso see that danger, misery, and suffering in the war will have\nimprinted on these faces the consciousness of their dignity, of high\nthoughts, of a sentiment.\n\nSuddenly a deafening noise makes you quake from head to foot. You hear\nat the same instant the shot whistling away, while a thick powder-smoke\nenvelops the platform and the black figures of sailors moving about.\nListen to their conversation, notice their animation, and you will\ndiscover among them a feeling which you would not expect to meet--that\nof hatred of the enemy, of vengeance. \xe2\x80\x9cIt fell straight into the\nembrasure; two killed. Look! they are carrying them away,\xe2\x80\x9d and they\nshout for joy. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he is getting angry now, he is going to hit back,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsays a voice, and in truth you see at the same instant a flash and\nspurting smoke, and the sentinel on the parapet calls, \xe2\x80\x9cCannon!\xe2\x80\x9d A ball\nwhizzes in your ears and buries itself in the ground, digging it up and\ncasting around a shower of earth and stones. The commander of the\nbattery gets angry, renews the order to load a second, a third gun. The\nenemy replies, and you experience interesting sensations. The sentinel\nagain calls, \xe2\x80\x9cCannon!\xe2\x80\x9d and the same sound, the same blow, and the same\nthrowing up of earth are repeated. If, on the other hand, he cries,\n\xe2\x80\x9cMortar!\xe2\x80\x9d you will be struck by a regular, not disagreeable hissing,\nwhich has no connection in your mind with anything terrible. It comes\nnearer and with greater rapidity. You see the black ball fall to the\nground, and the bomb-shell burst with a metallic cracking. The pieces\nfly in air, whistling and screeching; stones hit each other, and mud\nsplashes over you. You feel a strange mixture of pleasure and fright at\nthese different sounds. At the instant the projectile reaches you, you\ninvariably think it will kill you. But pride keeps you up, and no one\nnotices the dagger that is digging into your heart. So when it has\npassed without grazing you, you live again; for an instant a feeling of\nindescribable sweetness possesses you to such a degree that you find a\nspecial charm in danger, in the game of life and death. You would like\nto have a ball or a shell fall nearer, very near you. But the sentinel\nannounces with his strong, full voice, \xe2\x80\x9cMortar!\xe2\x80\x9d The hissing, the blow,\nthe explosion are repeated, but accompanied this time by a human\ngroan. You go up to the wounded man at the same time with the\nstretcher-bearers. He has a strange look, lying in the mud mingled with\nhis blood. Part of his chest has been carried away. In the first moment\nhis mud-splashed face expresses only fright and the premature sensation\nof pain, a feeling familiar to man in this situation. But when they\nbring the stretcher to him, and he unassisted lies down on it on his\nuninjured side, an exalted expression, elevated but restrained thoughts,\nenliven his features. With brilliant eyes and shut teeth he raises his\nhead with an effort, and at the moment the stretcher-bearers move he\nstops them, and addressing his comrades with trembling voice, says,\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, brothers!\xe2\x80\x9d He would like to say something more, he seems to\nbe trying to find something touching to say, but he limits himself to\nrepeating, \xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, brothers!\xe2\x80\x9d A comrade approaches the wounded man,\nputs his cap on his head for him, and turns back to his cannon with a\ngesture of perfect indifference. At the sight of your terrified\nexpression of face the officer, yawning, and rolling between his fingers\na cigarette in yellow paper, says, \xe2\x80\x9cSo it is every day, up to seven or\neight men.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nYou have just seen the defenders of Sebastopol on the very place of the\ndefence, and, strange to say, you will retrace your steps without paying\nthe least attention to the bullets and balls which continue to whistle\nthe whole length of the road as far as the ruins of the theatre. You\nwalk with calmness, your soul elevated and strengthened, for you bring\naway the consoling conviction that never, and in no place, can the\nstrength of the Russian people be broken; and you have gained this\nconviction not from the solidity of the parapets, from the ingeniously\ncombined intrenchments, from the number of mines, from the cannon\nheaped one on the other, and all of which you have not in the least\nunderstood, but from the eyes, the words, the bearing, from what may be\ncalled the spirit of the defenders of Sebastopol.\n\nThere is so much simplicity and so little effort in what they do that\nyou are persuaded that they could, if it were necessary, do a hundred\ntimes more, that they could do everything. You judge that the sentiment\nthat impels them is not the one you have experienced, mean and vain, but\nanother and more powerful one, which has made men of them, living\ntranquilly in the mud, working and watching among the bullets, with a\nhundred chances to one of being killed, contrary to the common lot of\ntheir kind. It is not for a cross, for rank; it is not that they are\nthreatened into submitting to such terrible conditions of existence.\nThere must be another, a higher motive power. This motive power is found\nin a sentiment which rarely shows itself, which is concealed with\nmodesty, but which is deeply rooted in every Russian heart--patriotism.\nIt is now only that the tales that circulated during the first period of\nthe siege of Sebastopol, when there were neither fortifications, nor\ntroops, nor material possibility of holding out there, and when,\nmoreover, no one admitted the thought of surrender--it is now only that\nthe anecdote of Korniloff, that hero worthy of antique Greece, who said\nto his troops, \xe2\x80\x9cChildren, we will die, but we will not surrender\nSebastopol,\xe2\x80\x9d and the reply of our brave soldiers, incapable of using set\nspeeches, \xe2\x80\x9cWe will die, hurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d--it is now only that these stories have\nceased to be to you beautiful historical legends, since they have become\ntruth, facts. You will easily picture to yourself, in the place of those\nyou have just seen, the heroes of this period of trial, who never lost\ncourage, and who joyfully prepared to die, not for the defence of the\ncity, but for the defence of the country. Russia will long preserve the\nsublime traces of the epoch of Sebastopol, of which the Russian people\nwere the heroes!\n\nDay closes; the sun, disappearing at the horizon, shines through the\ngray clouds which surround it, and lights up with purple rays the\nrippling sea with its green reflections, covered with ships and boats,\nthe white houses of the city, and the population stirring there. On the\nboulevard a regimental band is playing an old waltz, which sounds far\nover the water, and to which the cannonade of the bastions forms a\nstrange and striking accompaniment.\n\n\n\n\n\n_SEBASTOPOL IN MAY, 1855._\n\n\nSix months had rolled by since the first bomb-shell thrown from the\nbastions of Sebastopol ploughed up the soil and cast it upon the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s\nworks. Since that time millions of bombs, bullets, and balls had never\nceased flying from bastions to trenches, from trenches to bastions, and\nthe angel of death had constantly hovered over them.\n\nThe self-love of thousands of human beings had been sometimes wounded,\nsometimes satisfied, sometimes soothed in the embrace of death! What\nnumbers of red coffins with coarse palls!--and the bastions still\ncontinued to roar. The French in their camp, moved by an involuntary\nfeeling of anxiety and terror, examined in the soft evening light the\nyellow and burrowed earth of the bastions of Sebastopol, where the black\nsilhouettes of our sailors came and went; they counted the embrasures\nbristling with fierce-looking cannon. On the telegraph tower an\nunder-officer was watching through his field-glass the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s soldiers,\ntheir batteries, their tents, the movements of their troops on the\nMamelon-Vert, and the smoke ascending from the trenches. A crowd\ncomposed of heterogeneous races, moved by quite different desires,\nconverged from all parts of the world towards this fatal spot. Powder\nand blood had not succeeded in solving the question which diplomats\ncould not settle.\n\n\nI.\n\nA regimental band was playing in the besieged city of Sebastopol; a\ncrowd of soldiers and women in Sunday best was promenading in the\navenues. The clear sun of spring had risen upon the English works, had\npassed over the fortifications, over the city, and over the Nicholas\nbarracks, shedding everywhere its just and joyous light; now it was\nsetting into the blue distance of the sea, which gently rippled,\nsparkling with silvery reflections.\n\nAn infantry officer of tall stature and with a slight stoop, busy\nputting on gloves of doubtful whiteness, though still presentable, came\nout of one of the small sailor-houses built on the left side of Marine\nStreet. He directed his steps towards the boulevard, fixing his eyes in\na distracted manner on the toe of his boots. The expression of his\nill-favored face did not denote a high intellectual capacity, but traits\nof good-fellowship, good sense, honesty, and love of order were to be\nplainly recognized there. He was not well-built, and seemed to feel some\nconfusion at the awkwardness of his own motions. He had a well-worn cap\non his head, and on his shoulders a light cloak of a curious purplish\ncolor, under which could be seen his watch-chain, his trousers with\nstraps, and his clean and well-polished boots. If his features had not\nclearly indicated his pure Russian origin he would have been taken for a\nGerman, for an aide-de-camp, or for a regimental baggage-master--he wore\nno spurs, to be sure--or for one of those cavalry officers who have been\nexchanged in order to take active service. In fact, he was one of the\nlatter, and while going up to the boulevard he was thinking of a letter\nhe had just received from an ex-comrade, now a landholder in the\nGovernment of F----; he was thinking of his comrade\xe2\x80\x99s wife, pale,\nblue-eyed Natacha, his best friend; he was especially recalling the\nfollowing passage:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen they bring us the _Invalide_,[A] Poupka (that was the name the\nretired uhlan gave his wife) rushes into the antechamber, seizes the\npaper, and throws herself upon the sofa in the arbor[B] in the parlor,\nwhere we have passed so many pleasant winter evenings in your company\nwhile your regiment was in garrison in our city. You can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine the\nenthusiasm with which she reads the story of your heroic exploits!\n\xe2\x80\x98Mikhailoff,\xe2\x80\x99 she often says in speaking of you, \xe2\x80\x98is a pearl of a man,\nand I shall throw myself on his neck when I see him again! _He is\nfighting in the bastions, he is!_ He will get the cross of St. George,\nand the newspapers will be full of him.\xe2\x80\x99 Indeed, I am beginning to be\njealous of you. It takes the papers a very long time to get to us, and\nalthough a thousand bits of news fly from mouth to mouth, we can\xe2\x80\x99t\nbelieve all of them. For example: your good friends the _musical girls_\nrelated yesterday how Napoleon, taken prisoner by our cossacks, had been\nbrought to Petersburg--you understand that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that! Then\none of the officials of the war office, a fine fellow, and a great\naddition to society now our little town is deserted, assured us that our\ntroops had occupied Eupatoria, _thus preventing the French from\ncommunicating with Balaklava_; that we lost two hundred men in this\nbusiness, and they about fifteen thousand. My wife was so much delighted\nat this that she celebrated it all night long, and she has a feeling\nthat you took part in the action and distinguished yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn spite of these words, in spite of the expressions which I have put in\nitalics and the general tone of the letter, Captain Mikha\xc3\xafloff took a\nsweet and sad satisfaction in imagining himself with his pale,\nprovincial lady friend. He recalled their evening conversations on\n_sentiment_ in the parlor arbor, and how his brave comrade, the\nex-uhlan, became vexed and disputed over games of cards with kopek\nstakes when they succeeded in starting a game in his study, and how his\nwife joked him about it. He recalled the friendship these good people\nhad shown for him; and perhaps there was something more than friendship\non the side of the pale friend! All these pictures in their familiar\nframes arose in his imagination with marvellous softness. He saw them in\na rosy atmosphere, and, smiling at them, he handled affectionately the\nletter in the bottom of his pocket.\n\nThese memories brought the captain involuntarily back to his hopes, to\nhis dreams. \xe2\x80\x9cImagine,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, as he went along the narrow alley,\n\xe2\x80\x9cNatacha\xe2\x80\x99s joy and astonishment when she reads in the _Invalide_ that I\nhave been the first to get possession of a cannon, and have received the\nSaint George! I shall be promoted to be captain-major: I was proposed\nfor it a long time ago. It will then be very easy for me to get to be\nchief of an army battalion in the course of a year, for many among us\nhave been killed, and many others will be during this campaign. Then, in\nthe next battle, when I have made myself well known, they will intrust a\nregiment to me, and I shall become lieutenant-colonel, commander of the\nOrder of Saint Anne--then colonel--\xe2\x80\x9d He was already imagining himself\ngeneral, honoring with his presence Natacha, his comrade\xe2\x80\x99s widow--for\nhis friend would, according to the dream, have to die about this\ntime--when the sound of the band came distinctly to his ears. A crowd of\npromenaders attracted his gaze, and he came to himself on the boulevard\nas before, second-captain of infantry.\n\n\nII.\n\nHe first approached the pavilion, by the side of which several musicians\nwere playing. Other soldiers of the same regiment served as music-stands\nby holding before them the open music-books, and a small circle\nsurrounded them, quartermasters, under-officers, nurses, and children,\nengaged in watching rather than in listening. Around the pavilion\nmarines, aides-de-camp, officers in white gloves were standing, were\nsitting, or promenading. Farther off in the broad avenue could be seen a\nconfused crowd of officers of every branch of the service, women of\nevery class, some with bonnets on, the majority with kerchiefs on their\nheads; others wore neither bonnets nor kerchiefs, but, astonishing to\nrelate, there were no old women, all were young. Below in fragrant paths\nshaded by white acacias were seen isolated groups, seated and walking.\n\nNo one expressed any particular joy at the sight of Captain Mikha\xc3\xafloff,\nwith the exception, perhaps, of Objogoff and Souslikoff, captains in his\nregiment, who shook his hand warmly. But the first of the two had no\ngloves; he wore trousers of camel\xe2\x80\x99s-hair cloth, a shabby coat, and his\nred face was covered with perspiration; the second spoke with too loud a\nvoice, and with shocking freedom of speech. It was not very flattering\nto walk with these men, especially in the presence of officers in white\ngloves. Among the latter was an aide-de-camp, with whom Mikha\xc3\xafloff\nexchanged salutes, and a staff-officer whom he could have saluted as\nwell, having seen him a couple of times at the quarters of a common\nfriend.\n\nThere was positively no pleasure in promenading with these two comrades,\nwhom he met five or six times a day, and shook hands with them each\ntime. He did not come to the band concert for that.\n\nHe would have liked to go up to the aide-de-camp with whom he exchanged\nsalutes, and to chat with those gentlemen, not in order that Captains\nObjogoff, Souslikoff, Lieutenant Paschtezky, and others might see him in\nconversation with them, but simply because they were agreeable,\nwell-informed people who could tell him something.\n\nWhy is Mikha\xc3\xafloff afraid? and why can\xe2\x80\x99t he make up his mind to go up to\nthem? It is because he distrustfully asks himself what he will do if\nthese gentlemen do not return his salute, if they continue to chat\ntogether, pretending not to see him, and if they go away, leaving him\nalone among the _aristocrats_. The word _aristocrat_, taken in the sense\nof a particular group, selected with great care, belonging to every\nclass of society, has lately gained a great popularity among us in\nRussia--where it never ought to have taken root. It has entered into all\nthe social strata where vanity has crept in--and where does not this\npitiable weakness creep in? Everywhere; among the merchants, the\nofficials, the quartermasters, the officers; at Saratoff, at Mamadisch,\nat Vinitzy--everywhere, in a word, where men are. Now, since there are\nmany men in a besieged city like Sebastopol, there is also a great deal\nof vanity; that is to say, _aristocrats_ are there in large numbers,\nalthough death, the great leveller, hovers constantly over the head of\neach man, be he aristocrat or not.\n\nTo Captain Objogoff, Second-captain Mikha\xc3\xafloff is an _aristocrat_; to\nSecond-captain Mikha\xc3\xafloff, Aide-de-camp Kalouguine is an _aristocrat_,\nbecause he is aide-de-camp, and says thee and thou familiarly to other\naides-de-camp; lastly, to Kalouguine, Count Nordoff is an _aristocrat_,\nbecause he is aide-de-camp of the Emperor.\n\nVanity, vanity, nothing but vanity! even in the presence of death, and\namong men ready to die for an exalted idea. Is not vanity the\ncharacteristic trait, the destructive ill of our age? Why has this\nweakness not been recognized hitherto, just as small-pox or cholera has\nbeen recognized? Why in our time are there only three kinds of\nmen--those who accept vanity as an existing fact, necessary, and\nconsequently just, and freely submit to it; those who consider it an\nevil element, but one impossible to destroy; and those who act under its\ninfluence with unconscious servility? Why have Homer and Shakespeare\nspoken of love, of glory, and of suffering, while the literature of our\ncentury is only the interminable history of snobbery and vanity?\n\nMikha\xc3\xafloff, not able to make up his mind, twice passed in front of the\nlittle group of _aristocrats_. The third time, making a violent effort,\nhe approached them. The group was composed of four officers--the\naide-de-camp Kalouguine, whom Mikha\xc3\xafloff was acquainted with, the\naide-de-camp Prince Galtzine, an _aristocrat_ to Kalouguine himself,\nColonel Neferdoff, one of the _Hundred and Twenty-two_ (a group of\nsociety men who had re-entered the service for this campaign were thus\ncalled), lastly, Captain of Cavalry Praskoukine, who was also among the\nHundred and Twenty-two. Happily for Mikha\xc3\xafloff, Kalouguine was in\ncharming spirits; the general had just spoken very confidentially to\nhim, and Prince Galtzine, fresh from Petersburg, was stopping in his\nquarters, so he did not find it compromising to offer his hand to a\nsecond-captain. Praskoukine did not decide to do as much, although he\nhad often met Mikha\xc3\xafloff in the bastion, had drunk his wine and his\nbrandy more than once, and owed him twelve rubles and a half, lost at a\ngame of preference. Being only slightly acquainted with Prince Galtzine,\nhe had no wish to call his attention to his intimacy with a simple\nsecond-captain of infantry. He merely saluted slightly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kalouguine, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen are we going back to the little\nbastion? You remember our meeting on the Schwartz redoubt? It was warm\nthere, hey?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it was warm there,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mikha\xc3\xafloff, remembering that night\nwhen, following the trench in order to reach the bastion, he had met\nKalouguine marching with a grand air, bravely clattering his sword. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nwould not have to return there until to-morrow, but we have an officer\nsick.\xe2\x80\x9d And he was going on to relate how, although it was not his turn\non duty, he thought he ought to offer to replace Nepchissetzky, because\nthe commander of the eighth company was ill, and only an ensign\nremained, but Kalouguine did not give him time to finish.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a notion,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, turning towards Prince Galtzine, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\nsomething will come off in a day or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t something come off to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d timidly asked Mikha\xc3\xafloff,\nlooking first at Kalouguine and then at Galtzine.\n\nNo one replied. Galtzine made a slight grimace, and looking to one side\nover Mikha\xc3\xafloffs cap, said, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s silence,\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pretty girl!--yonder, with the red kerchief. Do you know her,\ncaptain?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a sailor\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. She lives close by me,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s look at her closer.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Prince Galtzine took Kalouguine by the arm on one side and the\nsecond-captain on the other, sure that by this action he would give the\nlatter a lively satisfaction. He was not deceived. Mikha\xc3\xafloff was\nsuperstitious, and to have anything to do with women before going under\nfire was in his eyes a great sin. But on that day he was posing for a\nlibertine. Neither Kalouguine nor Galtzine was deceived by this,\nhowever. The girl with the red kerchief was very much astonished, having\nmore than once noticed that the captain blushed as he was passing her\nwindow. Praskoukine marched behind and nudged Galtzine, making all\nsorts of remarks in French; but the path being too narrow for them to\nmarch four abreast, he was obliged to fall behind, and in the second\nfile to take Serviaguine\xe2\x80\x99s arm--a naval officer known for his\nexceptional bravery, and very anxious to join the group of\n_aristocrats_. This brave man gladly linked his honest and muscular hand\ninto Praskoukine\xe2\x80\x99s arm, whom he knew, nevertheless, to be not quite\nhonorable. Explaining to Prince Galtzine his intimacy with the sailor,\nPraskoukine whispered that he was a well-known, brave man; but Prince\nGaltzine, who had been, the evening before, in the fourth bastion, and\nhad seen a shell burst twenty paces from him, considered himself equal\nin courage to this gentleman; also being convinced that most reputations\nwere exaggerated, paid no attention to Serviaguine.\n\nMikha\xc3\xafloff was so happy to promenade in this brilliant company that he\nthought no more of the dear letter received from F----, nor of the\ndismal forebodings that assailed him each time he went to the bastion.\nHe remained with them there until they had visibly excluded him from\ntheir conversation, avoiding his eye, as if to make him understand that\nhe could go on his way alone. At last they left him in the lurch. In\nspite of that, the second-captain was so satisfied that he was quite\nindifferent to the haughty expression with which the yunker[C] Baron\nPesth straightened up and took off his hat before him. This young man\nhad become very proud since he had passed his first night in the\nbomb-proof of the fifth bastion, an experience which, in his own eyes,\ntransformed him into a hero.\n\n\nIII.\n\nNo sooner had Mikha\xc3\xafloff crossed his own threshold than entirely\ndifferent thoughts came into his mind. He again saw his little room,\nwhere beaten earth took the place of a wooden floor, his warped windows,\nin which the broken panes were replaced by paper, his old bed, over\nwhich was nailed to the wall a rug with the design of a figure of an\namazon, his pair of Toula pistols, hanging on the head-board, and on one\nside a second untidy bed with an Indian coverlet belonging to the\nyunker, who shared his quarters. He saw his valet Nikita, who rose from\nthe ground where he was crouching, scratching his head bristling with\ngreasy hair. He saw his old cloak, his second pair of boots, and the\nbundle prepared for the night in the bastion, wrapped in a cloth from\nwhich protruded the end of a piece of cheese and the neck of a bottle\nfilled with brandy. Suddenly he remembered he had to lead his company\ninto the casemates that very night.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be killed, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself; \xe2\x80\x9cI feel it. Besides,\nI offered to go myself, and one who does that is certain to be killed.\nAnd what is the matter with this sick man, this cursed Nepchissetzky?\nWho knows? Perhaps he isn\xe2\x80\x99t sick at all. And, thanks to him, a man will\nget killed--he\xe2\x80\x99ll get killed, surely. However, if I am not shot I will\nbe put on the list for promotion. I noticed the colonel\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction\nwhen I asked permission to take the place of Nepchissetzky if he was\nsick. If I don\xe2\x80\x99t get the rank of major, I shall certainly get the\nVladimir Cross. This is the thirteenth time I go on duty in the bastion.\nOh, oh, unlucky number! I shall be killed, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure; I feel it.\nNevertheless, some one must go. The company cannot go with an ensign;\nand if anything should happen, the honor of the regiment, the honor of\nthe army would be assailed. It is my duty to go--yes, my sacred duty. No\nmatter, I have a presentiment--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe captain forgot that he had this presentiment, more or less strong,\nevery time he went to the bastion, and he did not know that all who go\ninto action have this feeling, though in very different degrees. His\nsense of duty which he had particularly developed calmed him, and he sat\ndown at his table and wrote a farewell letter to his father. In the\ncourse of ten minutes the letter was finished. He arose with moist eyes,\nand began to dress, repeating to himself all the prayers which he knew\nby heart. His servant, a dull fellow, three-quarters drunk, helped him\nput on his new coat, the old one he was accustomed to wear in the\nbastion not being mended.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy hasn\xe2\x80\x99t that coat been mended? You can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything but sleep, you\nbeast!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSleep!\xe2\x80\x9d growled Nikita, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I am running about like a dog all day\nlong. I tire myself to death, and after that am not allowed to sleep!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are drunk again, I see.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t drink with your money; why do you find fault with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence, fool!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the captain, ready to strike him.\n\nHe was already nervous and troubled, and Nikita\xe2\x80\x99s rudeness made him lose\npatience. Nevertheless, he was very fond of the fellow, he even spoiled\nhim, and had kept him with him a dozen years.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFool! fool!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the servant. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you abuse me, sir--and at\nthis time? It isn\xe2\x80\x99t right to abuse me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMikha\xc3\xafloff thought of the place he was going to, and was ashamed of\nhimself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would make a saint lose patience, Nikita,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a softer\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x9cLeave that letter addressed to my father lying on the table.\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t touch it,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, blushing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nikita, weakening under the influence of the wine he\nhad taken, at his own expense, as he said, and blinking his eyes, ready\nto weep.\n\nThen when the captain shouted, on leaving the house, \xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, Nikita!\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe burst forth in a violent fit of sobbing, and seizing the hand of his\nmaster, kissed it, howling all the while, and saying, over and over\nagain, \xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, master!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAn old sailor\xe2\x80\x99s wife at the door, good woman as she was, could not help\ntaking part in this affecting scene. Rubbing her eyes with her dirty\nsleeve, she mumbled something about masters who, on their side, have to\nput up with so much, and went on to relate for the hundredth time to the\ndrunken Nikita how she, poor creature, was left a widow, how her husband\nhad been killed during the first bombardment and his house ruined, for\nthe one she lived in now did not belong to her, etc., etc. After his\nmaster was gone, Nikita lighted his pipe, begged the landlord\xe2\x80\x99s daughter\nto fetch him some brandy, quickly wiped his tears, and ended up by\nquarrelling with the old woman about a little pail he said she had\nbroken.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I shall only be wounded,\xe2\x80\x9d the captain thought at nightfall,\napproaching the bastion at the head of his company. \xe2\x80\x9cBut where--here or\nthere?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe placed his finger first on his stomach and then on his chest.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it were only here,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, pointing to the upper part of his\nthigh, \xe2\x80\x9cand if the ball passed round the bone! But if it is a fracture\nit\xe2\x80\x99s all over.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMikha\xc3\xafloff, by following the trenches, reached the casemates safe and\nsound. In perfect darkness, assisted by an officer of the sappers, he\nput his men to work; then he sat down in a hole in the shelter of the\nparapet. They were firing only at intervals; now and again, first on our\nside and then on _his_, a flash blazed forth, and the fuse of a shell\ntraced a curve of fire on the dark, starlit sky. But the projectiles\nfell far off, behind or to the right of the quarters in which the\ncaptain hid at the bottom of a pit. He ate a piece of cheese, drank a\nfew drops of brandy, lighted a cigarette, and having said his prayers,\ntried to sleep.\n\n\nIV.\n\nPrince Galtzine, Lieutenant-colonel Neferdorf, and Praskoukine--whom\nnobody had invited, and with whom no one chatted, but who followed them\njust the same--left the boulevard to go and drink tea at Kalouguine\xe2\x80\x99s\nquarters.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFinish your story about Vaska Mendel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kalouguine.\n\nHaving thrown off his cloak, he was sitting beside the window in a\nstuffed easy-chair, and unbuttoned the collar of his well-starched, fine\nDutch linen shirt.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did he get married again?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s worth any amount of money, I tell you! There was a time when there\nwas nothing else talked about at Petersburg,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Prince Galtzine,\nlaughingly.\n\nHe left the piano where he had been sitting, and drew near the window.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s worth any amount of money! I know all the details--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd gayly and wittily he set about relating the story of an amorous\nintrigue, which we will pass over in silence because it offers us little\ninterest. The striking thing about these gentlemen was, that one of them\nseated in the window, another at the piano, and a third on a chair with\nhis legs doubled up, seemed to be quite different men from what they\nwere a moment before on the boulevard. No more conceit, no more of this\nridiculous affectation towards the infantry officers. Here between\nthemselves they showed out what they were--good fellows, gay, and in\nhigh spirits. Their conversation continued upon their comrades and their\nacquaintances in Petersburg.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Maslovsky?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich one--the uhlan or the horse-guardsman?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know them both. In my time the horse-guardsman was only a boy just\nout of school. And the oldest, is he a captain?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, for a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he always with his Bohemian girl?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he left her--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the talk went on in this tone.\n\nPrince Galtzine sang in a charming manner a gypsy song, accompanying\nhimself on the piano. Praskoukine, without being asked, sang second, and\nso well too that, to his great delight, they begged him to do it again.\n\nA servant brought in tea, cream, and rusks on a silver tray.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive some to the prince,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kalouguine.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it strange to think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Galtzine, drinking his glass of tea\nnear the window, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we are here in a besieged city, that we have a\npiano, tea with cream, and all this in lodgings which I would be glad to\nlive in at Petersburg?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we didn\xe2\x80\x99t even have that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lieutenant-colonel, always\ndiscontented, \xe2\x80\x9cexistence would be intolerable. This continual\nexpectation of something, or this seeing people killed every day without\nstopping, and this living in the mud without the least comfort--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut our infantry officers,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Kalouguine, \xe2\x80\x9cthose who live in\nthe bastion with the soldiers, and share their soup with them in the\nbomb-proof, how do they get on?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do they get on? They don\xe2\x80\x99t change their linen, to be sure, for ten\ndays at a time, but they are astonishing fellows, true heroes!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJust at this moment an infantry officer entered the room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI--I have received an order--to go to general--to his Excellency, from\nGeneral N----\xe2\x80\x9d he said, timidly saluting.\n\nKalouguine rose, and without returning the salute of the new-comer,\nwithout inviting him to be seated, begged him with cruel politeness and\nan official smile to wait a while; then he went on talking in French\nwith Galtzine, without paying the slightest attention to the poor\nofficer, who stood in the middle of the room, and did not know what to\ndo with himself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been sent on an important matter,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, after a\nmoment of silence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that is so, be kind enough to follow me.\xe2\x80\x9d Kalouguine threw on his\ncloak and turned towards the door. An instant later he came back from\nthe general\xe2\x80\x99s room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, gentlemen, I believe they are going to make it warm to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! what--a sortie?\xe2\x80\x9d they all asked together.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, you will see yourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, with an enigmatic\nsmile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy chief is in the bastion, I must go there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Praskoukine, putting\non his sword.\n\nNo one replied; he ought to know what he had to do. Praskoukine and\nNeferdorf went out to go to their posts.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, gentlemen, _au revoir_! we will meet again to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d cried\nKalouguine through the window, while they set out at a rapid trot,\nbending over the pommels of their Cossack saddles. The sound of their\nhorses\xe2\x80\x99 shoes quickly died away in the dark street.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, tell me, will there really be something going on to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d said\nGaltzine, leaning on the window-sill near Kalouguine, whence they were\nwatching the shells rising over the bastions.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can tell you, you alone. You have been in the bastions, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAlthough Galtzine had only been there once he replied by an affirmative\ngesture.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, opposite our lunette there was a trench\xe2\x80\x9d--and Kalouguine, who was\nnot a specialist, but who was satisfied of the value of his military\nopinions, began to explain, mixing himself up and making wrong use of\nthe terms of fortification, the state of our works, the situation of the\nenemy, and the plan of the affair which had been prepared.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere! there! They have begun to fire heavily on our quarters; is that\ncoming from our side or from _his_--the one that has just burst there?\xe2\x80\x9d\nAnd the two officers, leaning on the window, watched the lines of fire\nwhich the shells traced crossing each other in the air, the white\npowder-smoke, the flashes which preceded each report and illuminated for\na second the blue-black sky; they listened to the roar of the cannonade,\nwhich increased in violence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a charming panorama!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kalouguine, attracting his guest\xe2\x80\x99s\nattention to the truly beautiful spectacle. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know that sometimes\none can\xe2\x80\x99t tell a star from a bomb-shell?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is true; I just took that for a star, but it is coming down.\nLook! it bursts! And that large star there yonder--what do they call it?\nOne would say it was a shell!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am so accustomed to them that when I go back to Russia a starry sky\nwill seem to me to be sparkling with bomb-shells. One gets so used to\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOught I not to go and take part in this sortie?\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Galtzine,\nafter a pause.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, what an idea! Don\xe2\x80\x99t think of it. I won\xe2\x80\x99t let you go;\nyou will have time enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeriously--do you think I ought not to?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt this moment, right in the direction these gentlemen were looking,\ncould be heard above the roar of artillery the rattle of a terrible\nfusillade; a thousand little flames spurted and sparkled along the whole\nline.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, it is in full swing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kalouguine. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t calmly listen to\nthis fusillade; it stirs my soul! They are shouting \xe2\x80\x98Hurrah!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\nstretching his ear towards the bastion, from which arose the distant and\nprolonged clamor of thousands of voices.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is shouting \xe2\x80\x98Hurrah\xe2\x80\x99--_he_ or we?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know; but they are surely fighting at the sword\xe2\x80\x99s point, for\nthe fusillade has stopped.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAn officer on horseback, followed by a Cossack, galloped up under their\nwindow, stopped, and dismounted.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you come from?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the bastion, to see the general.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, what is the matter? Speak!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have attacked--have taken the quarters. The French have pushed\nforward their reserves--ours have been attacked--and there were only two\nbattalions of them,\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer, out of breath.\n\nIt was the same one who had come in the evening, but this time he went\ntowards the door with confidence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we retreated?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Galtzine.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the officer, in a surly tone, \xe2\x80\x9ca battalion arrived in\ntime. We repulsed them, but the chief of the regiment is killed, and\nmany officers besides. They want reinforcements.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo saying, he went with Kalouguine into the general\xe2\x80\x99s room, whither we\nwill not follow them.\n\nFive minutes later Kalouguine set out for the bastion on a horse, which\nhe rode in the Cossack fashion, a kind of riding which seems to give a\nparticular pleasure to the aides-de-camp. He was the bearer of certain\norders, and had to await the definite result of the affair. As to Prince\nGaltzine, he, agitated by the painful emotions which the signs of a\nbattle in progress usually excite in the idle spectator, hastily went\nout into the street to wander aimlessly to and fro.\n\n\nV.\n\nSoldiers carried the wounded on stretchers, and supported others under\nthe arms. It was very dark in the streets; here and there shone the\nlights in the hospital windows or in the quarters of a wakeful officer.\nThe uninterrupted sound of the cannonade and the fusillade came from the\nbastions, and the same fires still lighted up the black sky. From time\nto time could be recognized the gallop of a staff-officer, the groan of\na wounded man, the steps and the voices of the stretcher-bearers, the\nexclamations of doting women who stood on the thresholds of their houses\nand watched in the direction of the firing.\n\nAmong these last we find our acquaintance Nikita, the old sailor\xe2\x80\x99s widow\nwith whom he had made up, and the little daughter of the latter, a child\nof ten years.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God! holy Virgin and Mother!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the old woman, with a\nsigh; and she followed with her eyes the shells which flew through\nspace from one point to another like balls of fire. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a misfortune!\nwhat a misfortune! The first bombardment was not so hard. Look! one\ncursed thing has burst in the outskirts of the town right over our\nhouse!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it is farther off; they are falling in Aunt Arina\xe2\x80\x99s garden,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nthe child.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is my master! where is he now!\xe2\x80\x9d groaned Nikita, still drunk, and\ndrawling his words. \xe2\x80\x9cNo tongue can tell how I love my master! If, God\nforbid, they commit the sin of killing him, I assure you, good aunt, I\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t be answerable for what I may do! Really, he is such a good master\nthat--There is no word to express it, you see. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t exchange him\nfor those who are playing cards inside, true. Pooh!\xe2\x80\x9d concluded Nikita,\npointing to the captain\xe2\x80\x99s room, in which the yunker Yvatchesky had\narranged with the ensigns a little festival to celebrate the decoration\nhe had just received.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a lot of shooting-stars there are! what a lot of shooting-stars\nthere are!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the child, breaking the silence which followed\nNikita\xe2\x80\x99s speech. \xe2\x80\x9cThere! there! another one is falling! What is that\nfor? Say, mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll destroy our cabin!\xe2\x80\x9d sighed the old woman, without replying.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-day,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the sing-song voice of the little prattler--\xe2\x80\x9cto-day I\nsaw in uncle\xe2\x80\x99s room, near the wardrobe, an enormous ball; it had come\nthrough the roof and had fallen right into the room. It is so large that\nthey can\xe2\x80\x99t lift it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe women who had husbands and money are gone away,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the old\nwoman. \xe2\x80\x9cI have only a cabin, and they are destroying that! Look! look\nhow they are firing, the wretches! Lord, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd just as we were coming out of uncle\xe2\x80\x99s house,\xe2\x80\x9d the child went on, \xe2\x80\x9ca\nbomb-shell came straight down; it burst, and threw the earth on all\nsides; one little piece almost struck us!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nVI.\n\nPrince Galtzine met in constantly increasing numbers wounded men borne\non stretchers, others dragging themselves along on foot or supporting\neach other, and talking noisily.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen they fell upon us, brothers,\xe2\x80\x9d said the bass voice of a tall\nsoldier who carried two muskets on his shoulder--\xe2\x80\x9cwhen they fell upon\nus, shouting \xe2\x80\x98Allah! allah!\xe2\x80\x99[D] they pushed one another on. We killed\nthe first, and others climbed over them. There was nothing to be done;\nthere were too many of them--too many of them!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou come from the bastion?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Galtzine, interrupting the orator.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, your Excellency.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what happened there? Tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis happened, your Excellency--_his strength_ surrounded us; he\nclimbed on the ramparts and had the best of it, your Excellency.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow? the best of it? But you beat them back?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh yes, beat them back! But when all _his strength_ came down upon us,\n_he_ killed our men, and no help for it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe soldier was mistaken, for the trenches were ours; but, strange but\nwell-authenticated fact, a soldier wounded in a battle always believes\nit a lost and a terribly bloody one.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was told, nevertheless, that you beat him back,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Galtzine,\ngood-naturedly; \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps it was after you came away. Did you leave there\nlong ago?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis very moment, your Excellency. The trenches must belong to him;\n_he_ had the upperhand--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you ashamed of yourselves? Abandon the trenches! It is\nfrightful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Galtzine, irritated by the indifference of the man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat could be done when _he_ had the _strength_.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, your Excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d said a soldier borne on a stretcher, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy not\nabandon them, when he has killed us all? If we had the _strength_ we\nwould never have abandoned them! But what was to be done? I had just\nstuck one of them when I was hit--Oh, softly, brothers, softly! Oh, for\nmercy\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\xe2\x80\x9d groaned the wounded man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold on; far too many are coming back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Galtzine, again stopping\nthe tall soldier with the two muskets. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you go back, hey?\nHalt!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe soldier obeyed, and took off his cap with his left hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going to?\xe2\x80\x9d sternly demanded the prince, \xe2\x80\x9cand who gave you\npermission, good-for--\xe2\x80\x9d But coming nearer, he saw that the soldier\xe2\x80\x99s\nright arm was covered with blood up to the elbow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am wounded, your Excellency.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWounded! where?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, by a bullet,\xe2\x80\x9d and the soldier showed his arm; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\nwhat hit me a crack there.\xe2\x80\x9d He held his head down, and showed on the\nback of his neck locks of hair glued together by coagulated blood.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhose gun is this?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a French carbine, your Excellency; I brought it away. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\nhave come away, but I had to lead that small soldier, who might fall\ndown;\xe2\x80\x9d and he pointed to an infantryman who was walking some paces ahead\nof them leaning on his gun and dragging his left leg with difficulty.\n\nPrince Galtzine was cruelly ashamed of his unjust suspicions, and\nconscious that he was blushing, turned around. Without questioning or\nlooking after the wounded any more, he directed his steps towards the\nfield-hospital. Making his way to the entrance with difficulty through\nsoldiers, litters, stretcher-bearers who came in with the wounded and\nwent out with the dead, Galtzine entered as far as the first room, took\none look about him, recoiled involuntarily, and precipitately fled into\nthe street. What he saw there was far too horrible!\n\n\nVII.\n\nThe great, high, sombre hall, lighted only by four or five candles,\nwhere the surgeons moved about examining the wounded, was literally\ncrammed with people. Stretcher-bearers continually brought new wounded\nand placed them side by side in rows on the ground. The crowd was so\ngreat that the wretches pushed against one another and bathed in their\nneighbors\xe2\x80\x99 blood. Pools of stagnant gore stood in the empty places; from\nthe feverish breath of several hundred men, the perspiration of the\nbearers, rose a heavy, thick, fetid atmosphere in which candles burned\ndimly in different parts of the hall. A confused murmur of groans,\nsighs, death-rattles, was interrupted by piercing cries. Sisters of\nCharity, whose calm faces did not express woman\xe2\x80\x99s futile and tearful\ncompassion, but an active and lively interest, glided here and there in\nthe midst of bloody coats and shirts, sometimes striding over the\nwounded, carrying medicines, water, bandages, lint. Surgeons with their\nsleeves turned up, on their knees before the wounded, examined and\nprobed the wounds by the flare of torches held by their assistants, in\nspite of the terrible cries and supplications of the patients. Seated at\na little table beside the door a major wrote the number 532.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIvan Bogo\xc3\xafef, private in the third company of the regiment from C----,\n_fractura femuris complicata_!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the surgeon, who was dressing a\nbroken limb at the other end of the hall. \xe2\x80\x9cTurn him over.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, oh, good fathers!\xe2\x80\x9d gasped the soldier, begging them to leave him in\npeace.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Perforatio capites._ Simon Neferdof, lieutenant-colonel of the\ninfantry regiment from N----. Have a little patience, colonel. There is\nno way of--I shall be obliged to leave you there,\xe2\x80\x9d said a third, who was\nfumbling with a sort of hook in the head of the unfortunate officer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s name, get done quickly!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Perforatio pectoris._ Sebastian Sereda, private--what regiment? But it\nis no use, don\xe2\x80\x99t write it down. _Moritur._ Carry him off,\xe2\x80\x9d added the\nsurgeon, leaving the dying man, who with upturned eyes was already\ngasping.\n\nForty or fifty stretcher-bearers awaited their burdens at the door. The\nliving were sent to the hospital, the dead to the chapel. They waited in\nsilence, and sometimes a sigh escaped them as they contemplated this\npicture.\n\n\nVIII.\n\nKalouguine met many wounded on his way to the bastion. Knowing by\nexperience the bad influence of this spectacle on the spirit of a man\nwho is going under fire, he not only did not stop them to ask questions,\nbut he tried not to notice those he met. At the foot of the hill he ran\nacross a staff-officer coming down from the bastion full speed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cZobkine! Zobkine! one moment!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you come from?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the quarters.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what is going on there? Is it hot?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTerribly!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the officer galloped off. The fusillade seemed to grow less; on the\nother hand, the cannonade began again with renewed vigor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHum--a bad business!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Kalouguine. He had an indefinite but very\ndisagreeable feeling; he had even a presentiment, that is to say, a very\ncommon thought--the thought of death.\n\nKalouguine possessed self-love and nerves of steel. He was, in a word,\nwhat is commonly called a brave man. He did not give way to this first\nimpression; he raised his courage by recalling the story of one of\nNapoleon\xe2\x80\x99s aides-de-camp, who came to his chief with his head bloody,\nafter having carried an order with all speed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you wounded?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the emperor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI crave pardon, sire, I am dead!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the aide-de-camp, and falling\nfrom his horse, died on the spot.\n\nThis anecdote pleased him. Putting himself in imagination in the place\nof the aide-de-camp, he lashed his horse, put on a still more \xe2\x80\x9cCossack\xe2\x80\x9d\ngait, and rising in his stirrups to cast a look upon the platoon that\nfollowed him on a trot, he reached the place where they had to dismount.\nThere he found four soldiers sitting on some rocks, smoking their pipes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing there?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have been carrying a wounded man, your Excellency, and we are\nresting,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of them, hiding his pipe behind his back and taking\noff his cap.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it--you are resting! Forward! to your post!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe put himself at their head and proceeded with them along the trench,\nmeeting wounded men at every step. On the top of the plateau he turned\nto the left and found himself, a few steps farther on, completely\nisolated. A piece of a shell whistled near him and buried itself in the\ntrenches; a mortar-bomb rising in the air seemed to fly straight for his\nbreast. Seized by a sudden terror, he rushed on several steps and threw\nhimself down. When the bomb had burst some distance off he was very\nangry with himself and got up. He looked around to see if any one had\nnoticed him lying down; no one was near.\n\nLet fear once get possession of the soul, and it does not readily yield\nits place to another sentiment. He who had boasted of never bowing his\nhead, went along the trenches at a rapid pace, and almost on his hands\nand feet.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! it is a bad sign,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, as his foot tripped. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be\nkilled, sure!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe breathed with difficulty; he was bathed with sweat, and he was\nastonished that he made no effort to overcome his fright. Suddenly, at\nthe sound of a step which approached, he quickly straightened up, raised\nhis head, clinked his sabre with a swagger, and lessened his pace. He\nmet an officer of sappers and a sailor. The former shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cLie down!\xe2\x80\x9d\npointing to the luminous point of a bomb-shell, which came nearer,\nredoubling its speed and its brightness.\n\nThe projectile struck in the side of the trench. At the cry of the\nofficer, Kalouguine made a slight, involuntary bow, then continued on\nhis way without a frown.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a brave fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d said the sailor who coolly watched the fall of\nthe bomb. His practised eye had calculated that the pieces would not\nfall into the trench. \xe2\x80\x9cHe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t lie down!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn order to reach the bomb-proof occupied by the commander of the\nbastion, Kalouguine had only one more open space to pass when he felt\nhimself again overcome by a stupid fear. His heart beat as if it would\nburst, the blood rushed to his head, and it was only by a violent effort\nof self-control that he reached the shelter at a run.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you so out of breath?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the general, after he had\ndelivered the order he brought.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI walked very quickly, Excellency.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I offer you a glass of wine?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKalouguine drank a bumper and lit a cigarette. The engagement was\nfinished, but a violent cannonade continued on both sides. The commander\nof the bastion and several officers, among them Praskoukine, were\nassembled in the bomb-proof; they were talking over the details of the\naffair. The interior, covered with figured paper with a blue ground,\nwas furnished with a lounge, a bed, a table covered with papers, and\ndecorated with a clock hanging on the wall and an image, before which\nburned a small lamp. Seated in this comfortable room, Kalouguine saw all\nthe marks of a quiet life; he measured with his eye the great beams of\nthe ceiling half a yard thick; he heard the noise of the cannonade,\ndeafened by the bomb-proofs, and he could not understand how he could\nhave yielded twice to unpardonable attacks of weakness. Angry with\nhimself, he would have liked to expose himself to danger again to put\nhis courage to the proof.\n\nA naval officer with a great mustache and a cross of Saint George on his\nstaff overcoat came at this moment to beg the general to give him some\nworkmen to repair two sand-bag embrasures in the battery.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very glad to see you, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kalouguine to the new-comer;\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe general charged me to ask you if your cannon can fire grape into\nthe trenches.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne single gun,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the captain, with a morose air.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go and look at them!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe officer frowned and growled out,\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have just passed the whole night there, and I have come in to rest a\nlittle; can\xe2\x80\x99t you go there alone? You will find my second in command,\nLieutenant Kartz, who will show you everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe captain had commanded this same battery for full six months, and it\nwas one of the most dangerous posts. He had not left the bastion,\nindeed, since the beginning of the siege, and even before the\nconstruction of the bomb-proof shelters. He had gained among the sailors\na reputation for invincible courage. On this account his refusal was a\nlively surprise to Kalouguine.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what reputations are!\xe2\x80\x9d thought the latter. \xe2\x80\x9cThen I will go\nalone, if you allow me,\xe2\x80\x9d he added aloud, in a mocking tone, to which the\nofficer paid no attention.\n\nKalouguine forgot that this man counted six whole months of life in the\nbastion, while he, altogether, at different times, had not passed more\nthan fifty hours there. Vanity, desire to shine, to get a reward, to\nmake a reputation, even the delight in danger, incited him still more,\nwhile the captain had become indifferent to all that. He had also made\na show, had performed courageous deeds, had uselessly risked his life,\nhad hoped for and had received rewards, had established his reputation\nas a brave officer. But to-day these stimulants had lost their power\nover him; he looked at things differently. Well understanding that he\nhad little chance of escaping death after six months in the bastions, he\ndid not thoughtlessly risk his life, and limited himself to fulfilling\nstrictly his duty. In fact, the young lieutenant appointed to his\nbattery only eight days ago, and Kalouguine to whom this lieutenant\nshowed it in detail, seemed ten times braver than the captain. Rising in\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s estimation, these two hung out of the embrasures and\nclimbed over the ramparts.\n\nHis inspection ended, and as he was returning to the bomb-proof,\nKalouguine ran against the general, who was going to the observation\ntower, followed by his staff.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Praskoukine,\xe2\x80\x9d ordered the general, \xe2\x80\x9cgo down, I beg, into the\nquarters on the right. You will find there the second battalion from\nM---- which is working down there. Order it to stop work, to retire\nwithout noise, and to rejoin its regiment in the reserve force at the\nbottom of the hill. You understand? Lead it yourself to the regiment.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m off,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Praskoukine, and he departed on the run.\n\nThe cannonade diminished in violence.\n\n\nIX.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you the second battalion of the regiment from M----?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\nPraskoukine of a soldier who was carrying sand-bags.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the commander?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMikha\xc3\xafloff, supposing that the captain of the company was wanted, came\nout of his pit, raised his hand to his cap, and approached Praskoukine,\nwhom he took for a commanding officer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe general orders you--you must--you must retire at once--without any\nnoise--to the rear; that is, to the reserve force,\xe2\x80\x9d said Praskoukine,\nstealthily looking in the direction of the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s fire.\n\nHaving recognized his comrade, and having gained an idea of the\nman\xc5\x93uvre, Mikha\xc3\xafloff dropped his hand and gave the order to the\nsoldiers. They took their muskets, put on their coats, and marched off.\n\nHe who has never felt it cannot appreciate the joy which a man\nexperiences at leaving, after three hours of bombardment, a place as\ndangerous as the quarters were. During these three hours Mikha\xc3\xafloff,\nwho, not without reason, was thinking of death as an inevitable thing,\nhad the time to get accustomed to the notion that he would surely be\nkilled, and that he no longer belonged to the living world. In spite of\nthat, it was by a violent effort that he kept from running when he came\nout of the quarters at the head of his company, side by side with\nPraskoukine.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Au revoir! bon voyage!_\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the major who commanded the battalion\nleft in the quarters. Mikha\xc3\xafloff had shared his cheese with him, both of\nthem seated in a pit in shelter of the parapet.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same to you; good-luck! It seems to me it is getting quieter.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut scarcely had he uttered these words than the enemy, who had\ndoubtless noticed the movement, began to fire his best; our side\nreplied, and the cannonade began again with violence. The stars were\nshining, but with little light, for the night was dark. The shots and\nthe shell explosions alone lighted for an instant the surrounding\nobjects. The soldiers marched rapidly and in silence, some hurrying past\nthe others: only the regular sound of their steps could be heard on the\nhardened earth, accompanied by the incessant roar of the cannonade, the\nclick of bayonets striking one another, the sigh or the prayer of a\nsoldier: \xe2\x80\x9cLord! Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOccasionally a wounded man groaned, and a stretcher was called for. In\nthe company which Mikha\xc3\xafloff commanded, the artillery fire had disabled\ntwenty-six men since the day before.\n\nA flash illuminated the distant darkness of the horizon; the sentinel on\nthe bastion cried, \xe2\x80\x9cCan--non!\xe2\x80\x9d and a ball, whistling over the company,\nburied itself in the ground, which it ploughed up, sending the stones\nflying about.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil take them! How slowly they march!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Praskoukine, who,\nfollowing Mikha\xc3\xafloff, was looking behind him at every step. \xe2\x80\x9cI could\nrun ahead, since I have delivered the order--Indeed, no! they would say\nI was a coward! Whatever happens I will march along with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is he following me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mikha\xc3\xafloff, on his side. \xe2\x80\x9cI always\nnoticed he brings bad luck. There comes another, straight towards us,\nseems to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA few hundred steps farther on they met Kalouguine on his way to the\nquarters, bravely rattling his sword. The general had sent him to ask\nhow the work went on, but at the sight of Mikha\xc3\xafloff he said to himself\nthat, instead of exposing himself to this terrible fire, he could just\nas well find out by asking the officer who came from there. Mikha\xc3\xafloff\ngave him, in fact, all the details. Kalouguine accompanied him to the\nend of the path, and re-entered the trench which led to the bomb-proof.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the news?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the officer, who was supping alone in the\nearthwork.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe there will be any more fighting.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow! no more fighting? On the contrary, the general has just gone up to\nthe bastion. A new regiment has arrived. Besides--listen!--the\nfusillade is beginning again. Don\xe2\x80\x99t go. What\xe2\x80\x99s the use of it?\xe2\x80\x9d added the\nofficer, as Kalouguine made a movement.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless, I ought to go,\xe2\x80\x9d said the latter to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever,\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t I been exposed to danger long enough to-day? The fusillade is\nterrible.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cI had better wait here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwenty minutes later the general came back, accompanied by his officers,\namong whom was the yunker, Baron Pesth, but Praskoukine was not with\nthem. Our troops had retaken and reoccupied the quarters. After having\nheard the details of the affair, Kalouguine went out of the shelter with\nPesth.\n\n\nX.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have some blood on your overcoat; were you fighting hand-to-hand?\xe2\x80\x9d\nasked Kalouguine.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! it is frightful! Imagine--\xe2\x80\x9d And Pesth began to relate how he had\nled his company after the death of his chief, how he had killed a\nFrenchman, and how, without his assistance, the battle would have been\nlost. The foundation of the tale, that is, the death of the chief and\nthe Frenchman killed by Pesth, was true, but the yunker, elaborating the\ndetails, enlarged on them and boasted.\n\nHe boasted without premeditation. During the whole affair he had lived\nin a fantastic mist, so much so that everything that had happened seemed\nto him to have taken place vaguely, God knows where or how, and to\nbelong to some one besides himself. Naturally enough he tried to invent\nincidents to his own advantage. However, this is the way the thing\nhappened:\n\nThe battalion to which he had been detailed to take part in the sortie\nremained two hours under the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s fire, then the commander said a few\nwords, the company chiefs began to move about, the troops left the\nshelter of the parapet and were drawn up in columns a hundred paces\nfarther on. Pesth was ordered to place himself on the flank of the\nsecond company. Neither understanding the situation nor the movement,\nthe yunker, with restrained breath and a prey to a nervous tremor which\nran down his back, placed himself at the post indicated, and gazed\nmechanically before him into the distant darkness, expecting something\nterrible. However, the sentiment of fear was not the dominating one in\nhis case, for the firing had ceased. What appeared to him strange,\nuncomfortable, was to find himself in the open field outside the\nfortifications.\n\nThe commander of the battalion once more pronounced certain words, which\nwere again repeated in a low voice by the officers, and suddenly the\nblack wall formed by the first company sank down. The order to lie down\nhad been given; the second company did the same, and Pesth in lying down\npricked his hand with some sharp thing. The small silhouette of the\ncaptain of the second company alone remained standing, and he brandished\na naked sword without ceasing to talk and to walk back and forth in\nfront of the soldiers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAttention, children! Show yourselves brave men! No firing! get at the\nwretches with the bayonet! When I shout \xe2\x80\x98hurrah!\xe2\x80\x99 follow me--closely and\nall together--we will show them what we can do. We won\xe2\x80\x99t cover\nourselves with shame, will we, children? For the Czar, our father!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the name of the company chief?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pesth from a yunker next\nto him. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a brave one!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he\xe2\x80\x99s always so under fire. He is called Lissinkoffsky.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJust at this moment a flame spurted out, followed by a deafening report;\nsplinters and stones flew in the air. Fifty seconds later one of the\nstones fell from a great height and crushed the foot of a soldier. A\nshell had fallen in the middle of the company, a proof that the French\nhad noticed the column.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you are sending us shells now! Let us get at you and you will taste\nthe Russian bayonet, curse you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe captain shouted so loud that the commander of the battalion ordered\nhim to be silent.\n\nThe first company rose up, after that the second; the soldiers took up\ntheir muskets and the battalion advanced.\n\nPesth, seized by a foolish terror, could not remember whether they\nmarched far; he went on like a drunken man. Suddenly thousands of fires\nflashed on all sides, with whizzings and crackings. He gave a yell and\nran forward, because they all yelled and ran; then he tripped and fell\nover something. It was the company chief, wounded at the head of his\ntroops, who took the yunker for a Frenchman and seized his leg. Pesth\npulled his feet away and got up. Some one threw himself on him in the\ndarkness, and he was almost knocked over again. A voice shouted to him,\n\xe2\x80\x9cKill him, then! What are you waiting for?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA hand seized his musket, the point of his bayonet buried itself in\nsomething soft.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Dieu!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThese words were spoken in French, with an accent of pain and fright.\nThe yunker knew he had just killed a Frenchman. A cold sweat moistened\nhis whole body; he began to tremble, and threw down his musket. But that\nlasted only a second; the thought that he was a hero came to his mind.\nPicking up his gun, he left the dead man, running and shouting \xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d\nwith the rest. Twenty steps farther on he reached the trench where our\ntroops and the commander of battalion were.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have killed one!\xe2\x80\x9d said he to the latter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a brave fellow, baron,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply.\n\n\nXI.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you know that Praskoukine is dead?\xe2\x80\x9d said Pesth to Kalouguine on the\nway back.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t possible!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? I saw him myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by; I am in a hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lucky day!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Kalouguine, as he was entering his quarters. \xe2\x80\x9cFor\nthe first time I am lucky. It has been a brilliant affair; I have come\nout of it safe and sound; there must be recommendations for decoration.\nA sword of honor will be the least they can give me. Faith, I have well\ndeserved it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe made his report to the general, and went to his room. Prince Galtzine\nwas reading a book at the table, and had been waiting for him a long\ntime.\n\nIt was with an inexpressible joy that Kalouguine found himself at home,\nfar from danger. Lying on his bed in his nightshirt, he related to\nGaltzine the incidents of the fight. These incidents naturally arranged\nthemselves so as to make it appear how he, Kalouguine, was a brave and\ncapable officer. He discreetly touched on this because no one could be\nignorant of it, and no one, with the exception of the defunct captain\nPraskoukine, had the right to doubt it. The latter, although he felt\nvery much honored to walk arm-in-arm with the aide-de-camp, had told one\nof his friends in his very ear the evening before that Kalouguine--a\nvery good fellow, however--did not like to walk on the bastions.\n\nWe left Praskoukine coming back with Mikha\xc3\xafloff. He reached a less\nexposed place and began to breathe again, when he perceived, on turning\naround, the sudden light of a flash. The sentinel shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cMor--tar!\xe2\x80\x9d\nAnd one of the soldiers who followed added, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is coming straight into\nthe bastion!\xe2\x80\x9d Mikha\xc3\xafloff looked. The luminous point of the bomb-shell\nseemed to stop directly over his head, exactly the moment when it was\nimpossible to tell what direction it was going to take. That was for the\nspace of a second. Suddenly, redoubling its speed, the projectile came\nnearer and nearer. The sparks of the fuse could be seen flying out, the\ndismal hissing was plainly audible. It was going to drop right in the\nmidst of the battalion. \xe2\x80\x9cTo earth!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted a voice. Mikha\xc3\xafloff and\nPraskoukine obeyed. The latter, with shut eyes, heard the shell fall\nsomewhere on the hard earth very near him. A second, which appeared to\nhim an hour, passed, and the shell did not burst. Praskoukine was\nfrightened; then he asked himself what cause he had for fear. Perhaps it\nhad fallen farther away, and he wrongly imagined that he heard the fuse\nhissing near him. Opening his eyes, he was satisfied to see Mikha\xc3\xafloff\nstretched motionless at his feet; but at the same time he perceived, a\nyard off, the lighted fuse of the shell spinning around like a top. A\nglacial terror, which stifled every thought, every sentiment, took\npossession of his soul. He hid his face in his hands.\n\nAnother second passed, during which a whole world of thoughts, of hopes,\nof sensations, and of souvenirs passed through his mind.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhom will it kill? Me or Mikha\xc3\xafloff, or indeed both of us together? If\nit is I, where will it hit me? If in the head, it will be all over; if\non the foot, they will cut it off, then I shall insist that they give me\nchloroform, and I may get well. Perhaps Mikha\xc3\xafloff alone will be killed,\nand later I will tell how we were close together, and how I was covered\nwith his blood. No, no! it is nearer me--it will be I!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThen he remembered the twelve rubles he owed Mikha\xc3\xafloff, and another\ndebt left at Petersburg, which ought to have been paid long ago. A\nBohemian air that he sang the evening before came to his mind. He also\nsaw in his imagination the lady he was in love with in her lilac trimmed\nbonnet; the man who had insulted him five years before, and whom he had\nnever taken vengeance on. But in the midst of these and many other\nsouvenirs the present feeling--the expectation of death--did not leave\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to explode!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, and was on the\npoint of opening his eyes with desperate boldness. But at this instant a\nred fire struck his eyeballs through the closed lids, something hit him\nin the middle of the chest with a terrible crash. He ran forward at\nrandom, entangled his feet in his sword, stumbled, and fell on his side.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod be praised, I am only bruised.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis was his first thought, and he wanted to feel of his breast, but his\nhands seemed as if they were tied. A vice griped his head, soldiers ran\nbefore his eyes, and he mechanically counted them:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne, two, three soldiers, and, besides, an officer who is losing his\ncloak!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA new light flashed; he wondered what had fired. Was it a mortar or a\ncannon? Doubtless a cannon. Another shot, more soldiers--five, six,\nseven. They passed in front of him, and suddenly he became terribly\nafraid of being crushed by them. He wanted to cry out, to say that he\nwas bruised, but his lips were dry, his tongue was glued to the roof of\nhis mouth. He had a burning thirst. He felt that his breast was damp,\nand the sensation of this moisture made him think of water.... He would\nhave liked to drink that which drenched him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must have knocked the skin off in falling,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, more\nand more frightened at the idea of being crushed by the soldiers who\nwere running in crowds before him. He tried again to cry out,\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake me!--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut instead of that he uttered a groan so terrible that he was\nfrightened at it himself. Then red sparks danced before his eyes; it\nseemed as if the soldiers were piling stones on him. The sparks danced\nmore rapidly, the stones piled on him stifled him more and more. He\nstretched himself out, he ceased to see, to hear, to think, to feel. He\nhad been killed instantly by a piece of shell striking him full in the\nbreast.\n\n\nXII.\n\nMikha\xc3\xafloff also threw himself down on seeing the shell. Like\nPraskoukine, he thought of a crowd of things during the two seconds\nwhich preceded the explosion. He said his prayers mentally, repeating,\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay Thy will be done! Why, O Lord, am I a soldier? Why did I exchange\ninto the infantry to make this campaign? Why did I not remain in the\nuhlan regiment, in the province of F----, near my friend Natacha? and\nnow see what is going to happen to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe began to count--\xe2\x80\x9cOne, two, three, four,\xe2\x80\x9d saying to himself that if\nthe shell exploded on an even number he would live, if at an odd number\nhe would be killed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all over, I am killed!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, at the sound of the\nexplosion, without thinking any more of odd or even. Struck on the head,\nhe felt a terrible pain.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, pardon my sins!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured, clasping his hands.\n\nHe tried to rise, and fell unconscious, face downward. His first\nsensation when he came to himself was of blood running from his nose.\nThe pain in his head was much lessened.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy soul is departing. What will there be over _yonder_? My God, receive\nmy soul in peace! It is nevertheless strange,\xe2\x80\x9d he reasoned, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I am\ndying, and I can distinctly hear the footsteps of the soldiers and the\nsound of shots!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA stretcher this way! The company chief is killed!\xe2\x80\x9d cried a voice which\nhe recognized, that of the drummer Ignatieff.\n\nSome one raised him up by the shoulders; he opened his eyes with an\neffort and saw the dark-blue sky over his head, myriads of stars, and\ntwo shells flying through space as if they were racing with each other.\nHe saw Ignatieff, soldiers loaded down with stretchers and with muskets,\nthe slope of the intrenchment, and suddenly he understood he was still\nin the world.\n\nA stone had slightly wounded him on the head. His first impression was\nalmost a regret. He felt so well, so quietly prepared to go over\n_yonder_, that the return to reality, the sight of the shells, of the\ntrenches, and of blood, was painful to him. The second impression was an\ninvoluntary joy at feeling himself alive, and the third was the desire\nto leave the bastion as quickly as possible. The drummer bandaged his\nchief\xe2\x80\x99s head and led him towards the field-hospital, supporting him\nunder his arm.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere am I going, and what for?\xe2\x80\x9d thought the captain, coming to himself\na little. \xe2\x80\x9cMy duty is to remain with my company--all the more,\xe2\x80\x9d\nwhispered a little voice within him, \xe2\x80\x9csince it will shortly be out of\nrange of the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no use, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the drummer, taking away his arm.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t go to the field-hospital; I will stay with my company.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better let yourself be properly taken care of, your Excellency.\nIt don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be anything at first, but it may grow worse. Indeed,\nyour Excellency--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMikha\xc3\xafloff stopped, undecided what to do. He would have followed\nIgnatieff\xe2\x80\x99s advice, perhaps, but he saw what a number of wounded men\ncrowded the hospital, almost all of them seriously hurt.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps the doctor will make fun of my scratch,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself,\nand without listening to the drummer\xe2\x80\x99s arguments he went with a firm\nstep to join his company.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is officer Praskoukine, who was beside me a short time ago?\xe2\x80\x9d he\nasked of the sub-lieutenant whom he found at the head of the company.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know; I think he was killed,\xe2\x80\x9d hesitatingly replied the latter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKilled or wounded? Why, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know? He was marching with us. Why\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t you bring him off?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t possible in that furnace.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! why did you abandon a living man, Mikha\xc3\xafl Ivanitch?\xe2\x80\x9d said\nMikha\xc3\xafloff, with a vexed tone. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he is dead, we must bring off his\nbody.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can he be alive? Indeed I tell you I went up to him, and I\nsaw--What would you have? We scarcely had time to bring off our own men.\nAh! the devils, how they are firing shell now!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMikha\xc3\xafloff sat down, and held his head in his hands. The walk had\nincreased the violence of the pain.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must certainly go and get him. Perhaps he is alive.\nIt is our duty, Mikha\xc3\xafl Ivanitch.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMikha\xc3\xafl Ivanitch did not reply.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t think of bringing him off at the time, and now I must detail\nmen for it. Why send them into this hell-fire, which will kill them, for\nnothing?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Mikha\xc3\xafloff.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cChildren, we must go back to get that officer who is wounded yonder in\nthe ditch,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, without raising his voice, and in a tone which had\nno authority, for he guessed how disagreeable the execution of this\norder would be to the men.\n\nBut since he addressed himself to no one in particular, not one of them\ncame forward at this call.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho knows? he is dead, perhaps, and it isn\xe2\x80\x99t worth while to risk our\nmen uselessly. It is my fault; I ought to have thought of it. I will go\nalone; it is my duty. Mikha\xc3\xafl Ivanitch,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, aloud, \xe2\x80\x9clead on the\ncompany, I will overtake you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nGathering up the folds of his cloak with one hand, he touched the image\nof St. Mitrophanes with the other. He wore this on his breast as a sign\nof special devotion to the blessed one.\n\nThe captain retraced his steps, assured himself that Praskoukine was\nreally dead, and came back holding in his hand the bandage which had\nbecome unwound from his own head. The battalion was already at the foot\nof the hill, and almost out of reach of the balls, when Mikha\xc3\xafloff\nrejoined it. A few stray shells still came in their direction.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must go to-morrow and be registered in the field-hospital,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\ncaptain to himself while the surgeon was dressing his wound.\n\n\nXIII.\n\nHundreds of mutilated, freshly bleeding bodies, which two hours before\nwere full of hopes and of different desires, sublime or humble, lay\nwith stiffened limbs in the flowery and dew-bathed valley which\nseparated the bastion from the intrenchment, or on the smooth floor of\nthe little mortuary chapel of Sebastopol. The dry lips of all of these\nmen murmured prayers, curses, or groans. They crawled, they turned on\ntheir sides, some were abandoned among the corpses of the blossom-strewn\nvalley, others lay on stretchers, on cots, and on the damp floor of the\nfield-hospital. Notwithstanding all this, the heavens shed their morning\nlight over Mount Saponn\xc3\xa9 as on the preceding days, the sparkling stars\ngrew pale, a white mist rose from the sombre and plaintively swelling\nsea, the east grew purple with the dawn, and long, flame-colored clouds\nstretched along the blue horizon. As on the days before, the grand torch\nmounted slowly, powerful and proud, promising joy, love, and happiness\nto the awakened world.\n\n\nXIV.\n\nOn the following evening the band of the regiment of chasseurs again\nplayed on the boulevard. Around the pavilion officers, yunkers,\nsoldiers, and young women promenaded with a festal air in the paths of\nwhite flowering acacias.\n\nKalouguine, Prince Galtzine, and another colonel marched arm-in-arm\nalong the street, talking of the affair of the day before. The chief\nsubject of this conversation was, as it always is, not of the affair\nitself, but of the part the talkers had taken in it. The expression of\ntheir faces, the sound of their voices, had something serious in it, and\nit might have been supposed that the losses profoundly affected them.\nBut, to tell the truth, since no one among them had lost any one dear to\nhim, they put on this officially mournful expression for propriety\xe2\x80\x99s\nsake. Kalouguine and the colonel, although they were very good fellows,\nwould have asked nothing better than to be present at a similar\nengagement every day, in order to receive each time a sword of honor or\nthe rank of major-general. When I hear a conqueror who sends to their\ndestruction millions of men in order to satisfy his personal ambition\ncalled a monster, I always want to laugh. Ask sub-lieutenants Petrouchef\nAntonoff, and others, and you will see that each is a little Napoleon, a\nmonster ready to engage in battle, to kill a hundred men, in order to\nobtain one more little star or an increase of pay.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ask pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d said the colonel, \xe2\x80\x9cthe affair began on the left flank.\n_I was there._\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Kalouguine, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I was almost all the time on the\nright flank. I went there twice, first to seek the general, then simply\nof my own accord to look on. It was there it was hot!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Kalouguine says so it is a fact,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the colonel, turning\ntowards Galtzine. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know that only to-day V---- told me you were a\nbrave man? Our losses are truly frightful. In my own regiment four\nhundred men disabled! I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand how I came out alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt the other end of the boulevard they saw Mikha\xc3\xafloff\xe2\x80\x99s bandaged head\narise. He was coming to meet them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you wounded, captain?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Kalouguine.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSlightly--by a stone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mikha\xc3\xafloff.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Le pavillon est il d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 amen\xc3\xa9?_\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Galtzine, looking over\nthe head of the captain, and addressing himself to no one in\nparticular.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Non pas encore_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mikha\xc3\xafloff, very anxious to show that he knew\nFrench.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes the armistice still go on?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Galtzine, addressing him\npolitely in Russian, as if to say to the captain, \xe2\x80\x9cI know you speak\nFrench with difficulty, why not simply speak Russian?\xe2\x80\x9d Upon this the\naides-de-camp went away from Mikha\xc3\xafloff, who felt, as on the evening\nbefore, very lonesome. Not wishing to come in contact with some of them,\nand not making up his mind to approach others, he limited himself to\nsaluting certain officers, and sat down near the Kazarsky monument to\nsmoke a cigarette.\n\nBaron Pesth also made his appearance on the boulevard. He related that\nhe had taken part in the negotiations of the armistice, that he had\nchatted with the French officers, and that one of them had said to him,\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf daylight had come an hour later the ambuscades would have been\nretaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTo which he had replied,\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir, I don\xe2\x80\x99t say they would not have been, so that I shall not\ncontradict you,\xe2\x80\x9d and his answer had filled him with pride.\n\nIn reality, although he had been present at the conclusion of the\narmistice, and had been very desirous of talking with the French, he\nhad said nothing remarkable. The yunker simply promenaded for a long\ntime in front of the lines, asking the nearest Frenchmen,\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat regiment do you belong to?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey answered him, and that was all. As he advanced a little beyond the\nneutral zone, a French sentinel, who did not imagine that the Russian\nunderstood his language, flung a formidable curse at him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is coming to examine our works, this damned--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIndeed, after that the yunker returned home, composing along the road\nthe French phrases he had just retailed to his acquaintances.\n\nCaptain Zobkine was also seen on the promenade, shouting with a loud\nvoice; Captain Objogoff, with his torn uniform; the captain of\nartillery, who asked no favors of any one; the yunker, in love--in a\nword, all the personages of the day before, swayed by the same eternal\nmoving forces. Praskoukine, Neferdoff, and several others were alone\nabsent. Nobody thought of them. Nevertheless, their bodies were neither\nwashed, nor dressed, nor buried in the earth.\n\n\nXV.\n\nWhite flags are flying on our fortifications and in the French\nintrenchments. In the blossom-covered valley mutilated bodies, clothed\nin blue or in gray, with bare feet, lie in heaps, and the men are\ncarrying them off to place them in carts. The air is poisoned by the\nodor of the corpses. Crowds of people pour out of Sebastopol and out of\nthe French camp to witness this spectacle. The different sides meet each\nother on this ground with eager and kindly curiosity.\n\nListen to the words exchanged between them. On this side, in a small\ngroup of French and Russians, a young officer is examining a\ncartridge-box. Although he speaks bad French, he can make himself\nunderstood.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why that--that bird?\xe2\x80\x9d he asks.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it is the cartridge-box of a regiment of the guard, sir. It is\nornamented with the imperial eagle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you--you belong to the guard?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon, sir, to the sixth regiment of the line.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this--where was this bought?\xe2\x80\x9d The officer points to the little\nwooden mouth-piece which holds the Frenchman\xe2\x80\x99s cigarette.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt Balaklava, sir. It is only palm-wood.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty,\xe2\x80\x9d replies the officer, obliged to make use of the few words he\nknew, and which, _nolens volens,_ intruded themselves into the\nconversation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will oblige me if you will keep that as a souvenir of this\nmeeting.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Frenchman throws away his cigarette, blows in the mouth-piece, and\npolitely presents it to the officer with a salute. The latter gives him\nhis in exchange. All the French and Russian by-standers smile and seem\ndelighted.\n\nHere comes a shrewd-looking infantryman in a red shirt, his overcoat\nthrown over his shoulders. His face is full of good spirits and\ncuriosity. Accompanied by two comrades, their hands behind their backs,\nhe approaches and asks a Frenchman for a light. The latter blows into\nhis pipe, shakes it, and offers a light to the Russian.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Tabac bonn!_\xe2\x80\x9d says the soldier in the red shirt, and the by-standers\nsmile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, good tobacco--Turkish tobacco!\xe2\x80\x9d answers the Frenchman; \xe2\x80\x9cand with\nyou Russian tobacco good?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Rouss bonn!_\xe2\x80\x9d repeats the soldier in the red shirt, and this time the\nspectators burst out laughing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Fran\xc3\xa7ais pas bonn, bonn jour, mousiou!_\xe2\x80\x9d continues the soldier, making\na show of all he knew in French, laughing, and tapping on the stomach of\nthe man who was talking with him. The Frenchmen also laugh.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are not pretty, these Russian B----,\xe2\x80\x9d said a Zouave.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are they laughing at?\xe2\x80\x9d asks another, with an Italian accent.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Le caftan bonn!_\xe2\x80\x9d the bold soldier begins again, examining the\nembroidered uniform of the Zouave.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo your places, _sacr\xc3\xa9 nom_!\xe2\x80\x9d shouts a French corporal at this instant.\n\nThe soldiers sulkily disperse.\n\nNevertheless, our young cavalry lieutenant is strutting in a group of\nthe enemy\xe2\x80\x99s officers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew Count Sasonoff well,\xe2\x80\x9d says one of the latter. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is one of the\ntrue Russian counts, such as we like.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI also knew a Sasonoff,\xe2\x80\x9d replies the cavalry officer, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a\ncount, as far as I know. He is a small, dark man about your age.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it, sir--that\xe2\x80\x99s he. Oh, how I would like to see the dear count!\nIf you see him, give him my regards. Captain Latour,\xe2\x80\x9d he adds, bowing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a miserable business we are carrying on! It was hot last night,\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d continues the cavalry officer, anxious to keep up the\nconversation, and pointing to the corpses.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sir, it is frightful. But what fine fellows your soldiers are! It\nis a pleasure to fight with fine fellows like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be confessed that your fellows are up to snuff also,\xe2\x80\x9d replies\nthe Russian horseman, with a salute, satisfied that he has given him a\ngood answer.\n\nBut enough on this subject. Let us watch that ten-year-old boy, with an\nold worn cap on his head which doubtless belonged to his father, and\nwith naked legs and large shoes on his feet, dressed in a pair of cotton\ntrousers, held up by a single brace. He came out of the fortifications\nat the beginning of the truce. He has been walking about ever since on\nthe low ground, examining with stupid curiosity the French soldiers and\nthe dead bodies lying on the ground. He is gathering the little blue\nfield-flowers with which the valley is strewn. He retraces his steps\nwith a great bouquet, holding his nose so as not to smell the fetid odor\nthat comes on the wind. Stopping near a heap of corpses, he looks a long\ntime at a headless, hideous, dead man. After an examination, he goes\nnear and touches with his foot the arm stretched stiffly in the air. As\nhe presses harder on it the arm moves and falls into place. The boy\ngives a cry, hides his face in the flowers, and enters the\nfortifications, running at full speed.\n\nYes, flags of truce float over the bastions and on the intrenchments;\nthe brilliantly shining sun is setting into the blue sea, which ripples\nand sparkles under the golden rays. Thousands of people assemble, look\nat each other, chat, laugh. These people, who are Christians, who\nprofess to obey the great law of love and devotion, are looking at their\nwork without throwing themselves down in repentance at the knees of Him\nwho gave them life, and with life the fear of death, the love of the\ngood and the beautiful. They do not embrace each other like brothers,\nand shed tears of joy and happiness! We must at least take consolation\nin the thought that we did not begin the war, that we are only defending\nour country, our native land. The white flags are lowered; the engines\nof death and of suffering thunder once more; again a flood of innocent\nblood is shed, and groans and curses can be heard.\n\nI have said what I have wanted to say for this time at least, but a\npainful doubt overwhelms me. It would have been better, perhaps, to have\nkept silent, for possibly what I have uttered is among those pernicious\ntruths obscurely hidden away in every one\xe2\x80\x99s soul, and which, in order to\nremain harmless, must not be expressed; just as old wine must not be\ndisturbed lest the sediment rise and make the liquid turbid. Where,\nthen, in my tale do we see the evil we must avoid, and the good towards\nwhich we must strive to go? Where is the traitor? Where is the hero? All\nare good and all are bad. It is not Kalouguine with his brilliant\ncourage, his gentlemanly bravado, and his vanity--the chief motive power\nof all his actions; it is not Praskoukine, an inoffensive cipher,\nalthough he fell on the battle-field for his faith, his ruler, and his\ncountry; nor timid Mikha\xc3\xafloff; nor Pesth, that child with no conviction\nand no moral sense, who can pass for traitors or for heroes.\n\nNo; the hero of my tale, the one I love with all the power of my soul,\nthe one I have tried to reproduce in all his beauty, just as he has\nbeen, is, and always will be beautiful, is Truth.\n\n\n\n\n_SEBASTOPOL IN AUGUST, 1855._\n\n\nI.\n\nTowards the end of the month of August there was slowly moving along the\nstony Sebastopol road between Douvanka[E] and Baktchisara\xc3\xaf an officer\xe2\x80\x99s\ncarriage of peculiar form, unknown elsewhere, which held a middle place\nin construction between a basket-wagon, a Jewish britchka, and a Russian\ncart.\n\nIn this carriage a servant, dressed in linen, with a soft and shapeless\nofficer\xe2\x80\x99s cap on his head, held the reins. Seated behind him, on parcels\nand bags covered with a soldier\xe2\x80\x99s overcoat, was an officer in a summer\ncloak, small in stature, as well as could be judged from the position he\nwas in, who was less remarkable for the massive squareness of his\nshoulders than for the thickness of his body between his chest and his\nback. His neck from the nape to the shoulder was heavy and largely\ndeveloped, and the muscles were firmly extended. What is commonly spoken\nof as a waist did not exist, nor the stomach either, although he was far\nfrom being fat; and his face, upon which was spread a layer of yellow\nand unhealthy sunburn, was noticeable by its thinness. It would have\npassed for an attractive one if it had not been for a certain bloating\nof the flesh and a skin furrowed by deep wrinkles, which, interweaving,\ndistorted the features, took away all freshness, and gave a brutal\nexpression. His small, brown, extraordinarily keen eyes had an almost\nimpudent look. His very thick mustache, which he was in the habit of\nbiting, did not extend much in breadth. His cheeks and his chin, which\nhe had not shaved for two days, were covered with a black and thick\nbeard. Wounded on the head by a piece of shell on the 10th of May, and\nstill wearing a bandage, he felt, nevertheless, entirely cured, and left\nthe hospital at Sympheropol to join his regiment, posted somewhere there\nin the direction where shots could be heard; but he had not been able to\nfind out whether it was at Sebastopol itself or at Severna\xc3\xafa or at\nInkerman. The cannonade was distinctly heard, and seemed very near when\nthe hills did not cut off the sound which was brought by the wind.\nOccasionally a tremendous explosion shook the air and made you tremble\nin spite of yourself. Now and then less violent noises, like a\ndrum-beat, followed each other at short intervals, intermingled with a\ndeafening rumble; or perhaps all was confounded in a hubbub of prolonged\nrolls, like peals of thunder at the height of a storm when the rain\nbegins to fall. Every one said, and indeed it could be heard, that the\nviolence of the bombardment was terrible. The officer urged his servant\nto hasten. They met a line of carts driven by Russian peasants, who had\ncarried provisions to Sebastopol, and who were on their way back,\nbringing sick and wounded soldiers in gray overcoats, sailors in black\npilot-coats, volunteers in red fez caps, and bearded militiamen. The\nofficer\xe2\x80\x99s carriage was forced to stop, and he, grimacing and squinting\nhis eyes in the impenetrable and motionless cloud of dust raised by the\ncarts, which flew into the eyes and ears on all sides, examined the\nfaces as they passed by.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a sick soldier of our company,\xe2\x80\x9d said the servant, turning\ntowards his master and pointing to a wounded man.\n\nSeated sidewise on the front of his cart a Russian peasant, wearing his\nwhole beard, a felt cap on his head, was tying a knot in an enormous\nwhip, which he held by the handle under his elbow. He turned his back to\nfour or five soldiers shaken and tossed about in the vehicle. One of\nthem, his arm tied up, his overcoat thrown on over his shirt, seated\nerect and firm, although somewhat pale and thin, occupied the middle\nplace. Perceiving the officer, he instinctively raised his hand to his\ncap, but remembering his wound, he made believe he wanted to scratch his\nhead. Another one was lying down beside him on the bottom of the cart.\nAll that could be seen of him was his two hands clinging to the wooden\nbars, and his two raised knees swinging nervelessly like two hempen\ndish-rags. A third, with swollen face, his head wrapped with a cloth on\nwhich was placed his soldier\xe2\x80\x99s cap, seated sidewise, his legs hanging\noutside and grazing the wheel, was dozing, his hands resting on his\nknees.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoljikoff!\xe2\x80\x9d the traveller shouted at him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPresent!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the latter, opening his eyes and taking off his cap.\nHis bass voice was so full, so tremendous, that it seemed to come out of\nthe chest of twenty soldiers together.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen were you wounded?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHealth to your Excellency!\xe2\x80\x9d[F] he cried with his strong voice, his\nglassy and swollen eyes growing animated at the sight of his superior\nofficer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the regiment?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt Sebastopol, your Excellency. They are thinking of going away from\nthere Wednesday.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere to?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t know--to Severna\xc3\xafa, no doubt, your Excellency. At present,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe continued, dragging his words, \xe2\x80\x9c_he_ is firing straight through\neverything, especially with shells, even away into the bay. _He_ is\nfiring in a frightful manner!--\xe2\x80\x9d And he added words which could not be\nunderstood; but from his face and from his position it could be guessed\nthat, with a suffering man\xe2\x80\x99s sense of injury, he was saying something of\na not very consoling nature.\n\nSub-lieutenant Koseltzoff, who had just asked these questions, was\nneither an officer of ordinary stamp nor among the number of those who\nlive and act in a certain way because others live and act thus. His\nnature had been richly endowed with inferior qualities. He sang and\nplayed the guitar in an agreeable manner, he conversed well, and wrote\nwith facility, especially official correspondence, of which he had got\nthe trick during his service as battalion aide-de-camp. His energy was\nremarkable, but this energy only received its impulse from self-love,\nand although grafted on this second-rate capacity, it formed a salient\nand characteristic trait of his nature. That kind of self-love which is\nmost commonly developed among men, especially among military men, was so\nfiltered through his existence that he did not conceive a possible\nchoice between \xe2\x80\x9cfirst or nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d Self-love was then the motive force\nof his most intimate enthusiasms. Even alone in his own presence he was\nfond of considering himself superior to those with whom he compared\nhimself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome! I am not going to be the one to listen to \xe2\x80\x98Moscow\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x99[G] chatter!\xe2\x80\x9d\nmurmured the sub-lieutenant, whose thoughts had been troubled somewhat\nby meeting the train of wounded; and the soldier\xe2\x80\x99s words, the importance\nof which was increased and confirmed at each step by the sound of the\ncannonade, weighed heavily on his heart.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are curious fellows these \xe2\x80\x98Moscows\xe2\x80\x99--Come, Nicola\xc3\xafeff, forward!\nyou are asleep, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d he angrily shouted at his servant, throwing\nback the lappels of his coat.\n\nNicola\xc3\xafeff shook the reins, made a little encouraging sound with his\nlips, and the wagon went off at a trot.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will stop only to feed them,\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer, \xe2\x80\x9cand then on the\nroad--forward!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nII.\n\nJust as he entered the street of Douvanka, where everything was in\nruins, Sub-lieutenant Koseltzoff was stopped by a wagon-train of\ncannon-balls and shells going towards Sebastopol, which was halted in\nthe middle of the road.\n\nTwo infantrymen, seated in the dust on the stones of an overthrown wall,\nwere eating bread and watermelon.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going far, fellow-countryman?\xe2\x80\x9d said one of them, chewing his\nmouthful. He was speaking to a soldier standing near them with a small\nknapsack on his shoulder.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are going to join our company; we have come from the country,\xe2\x80\x9d\nreplied the soldier, turning his eyes from the watermelon and arranging\nhis knapsack. \xe2\x80\x9cFor three weeks we have been guarding the company\xe2\x80\x99s hay,\nbut now they have summoned everybody, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t know where our\nregiment is to-day. They tell us that since last week our fellows have\nbeen at Korabelna\xc3\xafa. Do you know anything about it, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is in the city, brother, in the city,\xe2\x80\x9d replied an old soldier of the\nwagon-train, busy cutting with his pocket-knife the white meat of an\nunripe melon. \xe2\x80\x9cWe just came from there. What a terrible business,\nbrother!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you hear how he is firing now? No shelter anywhere! It is\nfrightful how many of our men _he_ has killed!\xe2\x80\x9d added the speaker,\nmaking a gesture, and straightening up his cap.\n\nThe soldier on his travels pensively shook his head, clacked his tongue,\ntook his short pipe out of its box, stirred up the half-burned tobacco\nwith his finger, lighted a bit of tinder from the pipe of a comrade who\nwas smoking, and lifting his cap, said,\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no one but God, gentlemen. We say good-by to you;\xe2\x80\x9d and putting\nhis knapsack in place, went his way.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! it is better worth while to wait,\xe2\x80\x9d said the watermelon eater, with\ntone of conviction.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all the same,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the soldier, settling the knapsack on his\nback, and worming his way between the wheels of the halted carts.\n\n\nIII.\n\nAt the station for horses Koseltzoff found a crowd of people, and the\nfirst figure he perceived was the postmaster in person, very young and\nvery thin, quarrelling with two officers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not only wait twenty-four hours but ten times twenty-four\nhours. Generals wait too,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with the evident wish to stir them\nup in a lively manner. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am not going to hitch myself in, you\nunderstand!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf this is so, if there are no horses, they can\xe2\x80\x99t be given to any one.\nWhy, then, are they given to a servant who is carrying baggage?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted\none of the two soldiers, holding a glass of tea in his hand.\n\nAlthough he carefully avoided using personal pronouns, it could easily\nbe guessed that he would have liked to say thee and thou to his\ninterlocutor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want you to understand, Mr. Postmaster,\xe2\x80\x9d hesitatingly said the other\nofficer, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we are not travelling for our pleasure. If we have been\nsummoned it is because we are necessary. You can be sure I will tell the\ngeneral, for it really seems as if you have no respect for the rank of\nofficer.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou spoil my work every time, and you are in my way,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined his\ncomrade, half vexed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you talk to him about respect? You have to\nspeak to him in another manner. Horses!\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly shouted, \xe2\x80\x9chorses,\nthis instant!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask better than to give them to you, but where can I get\nthem? I understand very well, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the postmaster,\nafter a moment of silence, and warming up by degrees as he gesticulated,\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut what do you want me to do? Let me just\xe2\x80\x9d--and the officers\xe2\x80\x99 faces at\nonce had a hopeful expression--\xe2\x80\x9ckeep soul and body together to the end\nof the month, and then I won\xe2\x80\x99t be seen any longer. I would rather go to\nthe Malakoff than remain here, God knows! Do what you like--but I\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t a single wagon in good condition, and for three days the horses\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t seen a handful of hay.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt these words he disappeared. Koseltzoff and the two officers entered\nthe house.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo!\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder to the younger with a calm tone, which strongly\ncontrasted with his recent wrath. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are already three months on the\nroad. Let\xe2\x80\x99s wait. It is no misfortune; there isn\xe2\x80\x99t any hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKoseltzoff with difficulty found in the room of the post-house, all\nsmoky, dirty, and filled with officers and trunks, an empty corner near\nthe window. He sat down there, and, rolling a cigarette, began to\nexamine faces and to listen to conversations. The chief group was placed\non the right of the entrance door, around a shaky and greasy table on\nwhich two copper tea-urns, stained here and there with verdigris, were\nboiling; lump-sugar was strewn about in several paper wrappings. A young\nofficer without a mustache, in a new Circassian coat, was pouring water\ninto a teapot; four others of about his own age were scattered in\ndifferent corners of the room. One of them, his head placed on a cloak\nwhich served him as a pillow, was sleeping on a divan; another, standing\nnear a table, was cutting roast mutton into small mouthfuls for a\none-armed comrade. Two officers, one in an aide-de-camp\xe2\x80\x99s overcoat, the\nother in a fine cloth infantry overcoat, and carrying a saddle-bag, were\nsitting beside the stove; and it could be readily divined by the way\nthey looked at the others, by the manner the one with the saddle-bag was\nsmoking, that they were not officers of the line, and that they were\nvery glad of it. Their manner did not betray scorn but a certain\nsatisfaction with themselves, founded partly on their relations with\nthe generals, and on a feeling of superiority developed to such a point\nthat they tried to conceal it from others. There was also in the place a\ndoctor with fleshy lips, and an artilleryman with a German physiognomy,\nseated almost on the feet of the sleeper, busily counting money. Four\nmen-servants, some dozing, some fumbling in the trunks and the packets\nheaped up near the door, completed the number of those present, among\nwhom Koseltzoff found not a face he knew. The young officers pleased\nhim. He guessed at once from their appearance that they had just come\nout of school, and this called to his mind that his young brother was\nalso coming straight therefrom to serve in one of the Sebastopol\nbatteries. On the other hand, the officer with the saddle-bag, whom he\nbelieved he had met somewhere, altogether displeased him. He found him\nto have an expression of face so antipathetic and so insolent that he\nwas going to sit down on the large base of the stove, with the intention\nof putting him in his proper place if he happened to say anything\ndisagreeable. In his quality of brave and honorable officer at the\nfront he did not like the staff-officers, and for such he took these at\nthe first glance.\n\n\nIV.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is bad luck,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the young fellows, \xe2\x80\x9cto be so near the end\nand not be able to get there. There will perhaps be a battle to-day,\neven, and we will not be in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe sympathetic timidity of a young man who fears to say something out\nof place could be guessed from the slightly sharp sound of his voice,\nand from the youthful rosiness which spread in patches over his fresh\nface.\n\nThe one-armed officer looked at him with a smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will have time enough, believe me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nThe young officer respectfully turning his eyes upon the thin face of\nthe latter suddenly lighted up by a smile, continued to pour the tea in\nsilence. And truly the figure, the position of the wounded man, and,\nabove all, the fluttering sleeve of his uniform, gave him that\nappearance of calm indifference which seemed to reply to everything\nsaid and done about him, \xe2\x80\x9cAll this is very well, but I know it all, and\nI could do it if I wanted to.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall we decide to do?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the young officer of his comrade\nwith the Circassian coat. \xe2\x80\x9cShall we pass the night here, or shall we\npush on with our single horse?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust think of it, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, when his companion had\ndeclined his suggestion (he spoke to the one-armed man, picking up a\nknife he had dropped), \xe2\x80\x9csince they told us that horses could not be had\nat Sebastopol at any price, we bought one out of the common purse at\nSympheropol.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid they skin you well?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about it, captain. We paid for the whole thing,\nhorse and wagon, ninety rubles. Is it very dear?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, addressing\nall who looked at him, Koseltzoff included.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t too dear if the horse is young,\xe2\x80\x9d said the latter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Nevertheless, we have been assured it was dear. He limps a\nlittle, it is true, but that will go off. They told us he was very\nstrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat institution are you from?\xe2\x80\x9d Koseltzoff asked him, wishing to get\nnews of his brother.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe belonged to the regiment of the nobility. There are six of us who\nare going of our own accord to Sebastopol,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the loquacious\nlittle officer, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we don\xe2\x80\x99t exactly know where our battery is. Some\nsay at Sebastopol, but this gentleman says it is at Odessa.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you have been able to find out at Sympheropol?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\nKoseltzoff.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey didn\xe2\x80\x99t know anything there. Imagine it. They insulted one of our\ncomrades who went to the government office for information! It was very\ndisagreeable. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you like to have this cigarette, already rolled?\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe continued, offering it to the one-armed officer, who was looking for\nhis cigar-case.\n\nThe young man\xe2\x80\x99s enthusiasm even entered into the little attentions he\nshowered on him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have also just come from Sebastopol?\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cHeavens, how\nastonishing! At Petersburg we did nothing but think of you all, you\nheroes!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, turning to Koseltzoff with good-fellowship and\nrespect.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat if you are obliged to go back there?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the latter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just what we are afraid of; for after having bought the horse\nand what we had to get--this coffee-pot, for example, and a few other\ntrifles--we are left without a penny,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a lower tone, casting\na look at his companion on the sly, \xe2\x80\x9cso that we don\xe2\x80\x99t know how we are\ngoing to get out of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t received money on the road, then?\xe2\x80\x9d Koseltzoff asked him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the young man, \xe2\x80\x9cbut they promised to give it to us here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you the certificate?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know the certificate is the chief thing. One of my uncles, a Senator\nat Moscow, could have given it to me, but I was assured I should receive\nit here without fail.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoubtless.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe it also,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young officer, in a tone which proved\nthat after having repeated the same question in thirty different places,\nand having received different replies everywhere, he no longer believed\nany one.\n\n\nV.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho ordered beet soup?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the house-keeper at this moment, a\nstout, slovenly dressed wench, about forty years old, who was bringing\nin a great earthen dish.\n\nThere was a general silence, and every eye was turned towards the woman.\nOne of the officers even winked, exchanging with his comrade a look\nwhich plainly referred to the matron.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it was Koseltzoff who ordered it,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the young officer; \xe2\x80\x9cwe\nmust wake him up. Halloo! come and eat,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, approaching the\nsleeper and shaking him by the shoulder.\n\nA youth of seventeen years, with black, lively, sparkling eyes and red\ncheeks, rose with a bound, and having involuntarily pushed against the\ndoctor, said, \xe2\x80\x9cA thousand pardons!\xe2\x80\x9d rubbing his eyes and standing in the\nmiddle of the room.\n\nSub-lieutenant Koseltzoff immediately recognized his younger brother and\nwent up to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know me?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, oh, what an astonishing thing!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the younger, embracing him.\n\nTwo kisses were heard, but just as they were about to give each other a\nthird, as the custom is, they hesitated a moment. It might have been\nsaid that each asked himself why he must kiss three times.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow glad I am to see you!\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder, leading his brother outside.\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s chat a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come! I don\xe2\x80\x99t want any soup now. Eat it up, F\xc3\xa9derson,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\nyouth to his comrade.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you were hungry--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want it now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOnce outside on the piazza, after the first joyous outbursts of the\nyouth, who went on to ask his brother questions without speaking to him\nof that which concerned himself, the latter, profiting by a moment of\nsilence, asked him why he had not gone into the guard, as they had\nexpected him to do.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I wanted to go to Sebastopol. If everything comes out all\nright, I shall gain more than if I had remained in the guard. In that\nbranch of the service you have to count ten years to the rank of\ncolonel, while here Todtleben has gone from lieutenant-colonel to\ngeneral in two years. And if I am killed, well, then, what\xe2\x80\x99s to be\ndone?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow you do argue,\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder brother, with a smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then, that I have just told you is of no importance. The chief\nreason\xe2\x80\x9d--and he stopped, hesitating, smiling in his turn, and blushing\nas if he were going to say something very shameful--\xe2\x80\x9cthe chief reason is\nthat my conscience bothered me. I felt scruples at living in Petersburg\nwhile men are dying here for their country. I counted also on being with\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, still more bashfully.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a curious fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the brother, without looking at him,\nhunting for his cigar-case. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry we can\xe2\x80\x99t stay together.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, pray tell me the truth about the bastions. Are they horribly\nfrightful?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, at first; then one gets used to it. You will see.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me also, please, do you think Sebastopol will be taken? It seems\nto me that such a thing cannot happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod only knows!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if you only knew how annoyed I am! Imagine my misfortune. On the\nroad I have been robbed of different things, among others my helmet, and\nI am in a fearful position. What will I do when I am presented to my\nchief?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nVladimir Koseltzoff, the younger, looked very much like his brother\nMichael, at least as much as a half-open columbine can resemble one\nwhich has lost its flower. He had similar blond hair, but thicker, and\ncurled around the temples; while one long lock strayed down the white\nand delicate back of his neck; a sign of happiness, as the old women\nsay. Rich young blood suddenly tinged his habitually dull complexion at\neach impression of his soul; a veil of moisture often swept over his\neyes, which were like his brother\xe2\x80\x99s, but more open and more limpid; a\nfine blond down began to show on his cheeks and on his upper lip, which,\npurplish red in color, often extended in a timid smile, exposing teeth\nof dazzling whiteness. As he stood there in his unbuttoned coat, under\nwhich could be seen a red shirt with Russian collar; slender,\nbroad-shouldered, a cigarette between his fingers, leaning against the\nbalustrade of the piazza, his face lighted up by unaffected joy, his\neyes fixed on his brother, he was really the most charming and most\nsympathetic youth possible to see, and one looked away from him\nreluctantly. Frankly happy to find his brother, whom he considered with\npride and respect as a hero, he was, nevertheless, a little ashamed of\nhim on account of his own more cultivated education, of his acquaintance\nwith French, of his association with people in high places, and finding\nhimself superior to him, he hoped to succeed in civilizing him. His\nimpressions, his judgments, were formed at Petersburg under the\ninfluence of a woman who, having a weakness for pretty faces, made him\npass his holidays in her house. Moscow had also contributed its part,\nfor he had danced there at a great ball at the house of his uncle the\nSenator.\n\n\nVI.\n\nAfter having chatted so long as to prove, what often happens, that,\nwhile loving each other very much, they had few common interests, the\nbrothers were silent for a moment or two.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, get your traps and we\xe2\x80\x99ll go,\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder.\n\nThe younger blushed and was confused.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStraight away to Sebastopol?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, at length.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you have many things with you; we will find\na place for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, we\xe2\x80\x99ll go,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the younger, as he went into the house\nsighing.\n\nJust as he was opening the door of the hall he stopped and held down his\nhead.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo straight to Sebastopol,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cbe exposed to\nshells--it is terrible! However, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it all the same whether it is\nto-day or later? At least with my brother--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTo tell the truth, at the thought that the carriage would carry him as\nfar as Sebastopol in a single trip, that no new incident would delay him\nlonger on the road, he began to appreciate the danger he had come to\nmeet, and the proximity of it profoundly moved him. Having succeeded in\ncalming himself at last, he rejoined his comrades, and remained such a\nlong time with them that his brother, out of patience, opened the door\nto call him, and saw him standing before the officer, who was scolding\nhim like a school-boy. At the sight of his brother his countenance fell.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll come at once,\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, making a gesture with his hand; \xe2\x80\x9cwait\nfor me, I\xe2\x80\x99m coming!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA moment later he went to find him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust think,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a deep sigh, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t go off with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStuff and nonsense! Why not?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to tell you the truth, Micha. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t a penny; on the\nother hand, we owe money to that captain. It is horribly shameful!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe elder brother scowled and kept silent.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you owe much?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked at last, without looking at him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not much; but it worries me awfully. He paid three posts for me. I\nused his sugar, and then we played the game of preference, and I owe him\na trifle on that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s bad, Volodia! What would you have done if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t met me?\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid the elder, in a stern tone, never looking at him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you know I count on receiving my travelling expenses at\nSebastopol, and then I shall pay him. That can still be done; and so I\nhad rather go there with him to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt this moment the elder brother took a purse out of his pocket, from\nwhich his trembling fingers drew two notes of ten rubles each and one of\nthree.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s all I have,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d He exaggerated a\nlittle in saying that it was all his fortune, for he still had four\ngold-pieces sewn in the seams of his uniform, but he had promised\nhimself not to touch them.\n\nIt was found, on adding up, that Koseltzoff owed only eight rubles--the\nloss on the game and the sugar together. The elder brother gave them to\nhim, making the remark that one never ought to play when he had not the\nwherewithal to pay. The younger said nothing; for his brother\xe2\x80\x99s remark\nseemed to throw a doubt on his honesty. Irritated, ashamed of having\ndone something which could lead to suspicions or reflections on his\ncharacter on the part of his brother, of whom he was fond, his sensitive\nnature was so violently agitated by it that, feeling it impossible to\nstifle the sobs which choked him, he took the note without a word and\ncarried it to his comrade.\n\n\nVII.\n\nNikola\xc3\xafeff, after refreshing himself at Douvanka with two glasses of\nbrandy which he bought from a soldier who was selling it on the bridge,\nshook the reins, and the carriage jolted over the stony road which, with\nspots of shadow at rare intervals, led along Belbek to Sebastopol; while\nthe brothers, seated side by side, their legs knocking together, kept an\nobstinate silence, each thinking about the other.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did he offend me?\xe2\x80\x9d thought the younger. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes he really take me for\na thief? He seems to be still angry. Here we have quarrelled for good,\nand yet we two, how happy we could have been at Sebastopol! Two\nbrothers, intimate friends, and both fighting the enemy--the elder\nlacking cultivation a little, but a brave soldier, and the younger as\nbrave as he, for at the end of a week I shall have proved to all that I\nam no longer so young. I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t blush any more; my face will be manly\nand my mustache will have time to grow so far,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, pinching\nthe down which was visible at the corners of his mouth. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps we will\nget there to-day, even, and will take part in a battle. My brother must\nbe very headstrong and very brave; he is one of those who talk little\nand do better than others. Is he continually pushing me on purpose\ntowards the side of the carriage? He must see that it annoys me, and he\nmakes believe he does not notice it. We will surely get there to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe continued to himself, keeping close to the side of the carriage,\nfearing if he stirred that he would show his brother he was not well\nseated. \xe2\x80\x9cWe go straight to the bastion--I with the artillery, my brother\nwith his company. Suddenly the French throw themselves upon us. I fire\non the spot, I kill a crowd of them, but they run just the same straight\nupon me. Impossible to fire--I am lost! but my brother dashes forward,\nsword in hand. I seize my musket and we run together; the soldiers\nfollow us. The French throw themselves on my brother. I run up; I kill\nfirst one, then another, and I save Micha. I am wounded in the arm; I\ntake my musket in the other hand and run on. My brother is killed at my\nside by a bullet; I stop a moment, I look at him sadly, I rise and cry,\n\xe2\x80\x98Forward with me! let us avenge him!\xe2\x80\x99 I add, \xe2\x80\x98I loved my brother above\neverything; I have lost him. Let us avenge ourselves, kill our enemies,\nor all die together!\xe2\x80\x99 All follow me, shouting. But there is the whole\nFrench army, P\xc3\xa9lissier at their head. We kill all of them, but I am\nwounded once, twice, and the third time mortally. They gather around me.\nGortschakoff comes and asks what I wish for. I reply that I wish for\nnothing--I wish for only one thing, to be placed beside my brother and\nto die with him. They carry me and lay me down beside his bloody corpse.\nI raise myself up and say, \xe2\x80\x98Yes, you could not appreciate two men who\nsincerely loved their country. They are killed--may God pardon you!\xe2\x80\x99 and\nthereupon I die.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWho could tell to what point these dreams were destined to be realized?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever been in a hand-to-hand fight?\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly asked his\nbrother, entirely forgetting that he did not want to speak to him\nagain.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, never. We have lost two thousand men in our regiment, but always in\nthe works. I also was wounded there. War is not carried on as you\nimagine, Volodia.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis familiar name softened the younger. He wished to explain himself to\nhis brother, who did not imagine he had offended him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you angry with me, Micha?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, after a few moments.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause--nothing. I thought there had been between us--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the elder, turning towards him and giving him a\nfriendly tap on the knee.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ask pardon, Micha, if I have offended you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the younger, turning\naside to hide the tears which filled his eyes.\n\n\nVIII.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this really Sebastopol?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Volodia, when they had reached the\ntop of the hill.\n\nBefore them appeared the bay with its forest of masts, the sea, with the\nhostile fleet in the distance, the white shore batteries, the barracks,\nthe aqueducts, the docks, the buildings of the city. Clouds of white\nand pale lilac-colored smoke continually rose over the yellow hills that\nsurrounded the city, and came out sharp against the clear blue sky,\nlighted by the rosy rays, brilliantly reflected by the waves; while at\nthe horizon the sun was setting into the sombre sea.\n\nIt was without the least thrill of horror that Volodia looked upon this\nterrible place he had thought so much about. He experienced, on the\ncontrary, an \xc3\xa6sthetic joy, a feeling of heroic satisfaction at thinking\nthat in half an hour he would be there himself, and it was with profound\nattention that he looked uninterruptedly, up to the very moment they\narrived at Severna\xc3\xafa, at this picture of such original charm. There was\nthe baggage of his brother\xe2\x80\x99s regiment, and there also he had to find out\nwhere his own regiment and his battery was.\n\nThe officer of the wagon-train lived near to what they called the new\nlittle town, composed of board shanties built by sailors\xe2\x80\x99 families. In a\ntent adjoining a shed of considerable size, made of leafy oak branches\nwhich had not yet time to wither, the brothers found the officer\nsitting down in a shirt of dirty yellow color before a rather slovenly\ntable, on which a cup of tea was cooling beside a plate and a decanter\nof brandy. A few crumbs of bread and of caviare had fallen here and\nthere. He was carefully counting a package of notes. But before bringing\nhim on the stage, we must necessarily examine closer the interior of his\ncamp, his duties, and his mode of life. The new hut was large, solid,\nand conveniently built, provided with turf tables and seats, the same as\nthey build for the generals; and in order to keep the leaves from\nfalling, three rugs, in bad taste, although new, but probably very dear,\nwere stretched on the walls and the ceiling of the building. On the iron\nbed placed under the principal rug, which represented the everlasting\namazon, could be seen a red coverlid of shaggy stuff, a soiled torn\npillow, and a cloak of cat-skin. On a table were, helter-skelter, a\nmirror in a silver frame, a brush of the same metal in a frightfully\ndirty state, a candlestick, a broken horn comb full of greasy hair, a\nbottle of liquor ornamented by an enormous red and gold label, a gold\nwatch with the portrait of Peter the Great, gilt pen-holders, boxes\nholding percussion-caps, a crust of bread, old cards thrown about in\ndisorder, and finally, under the bed, bottles, some empty, others full.\nIt was the duty of this officer to look out for the wagon-train and the\nforage for the horses. One of his friends, occupied with financial work,\nshared his dwelling, and was asleep in the tent at this moment, while he\nwas making out the monthly accounts with Government money. He had an\nagreeable and martial appearance. He was distinguished by his great\nsize, a large mustache, and a fair state of corpulence. But there were\ntwo unpleasant things in him which met the eye at once. First, a\nconstant perspiration on his face, joined with a puffiness which almost\nhid his little gray eyes and gave him the look of a leather bottle full\nof porter, and, second, extreme slovenliness, which reached from his\nthin gray hair to his great naked feet, shod in ermine-trimmed slippers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a lot of money!--heavens, what a lot of money!\xe2\x80\x9d said Koseltzoff\nthe first, who, on entering, cast a hungry look on the notes. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\nwould lend me half, Vassili Mikha\xc3\xaflovitch!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe officer of the wagon-train looked sour at the sight of the visitors,\nand gathering up the money, saluted them without rising.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if it were mine, but it is money belonging to the Crown, brother!\nBut whom have you there?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe looked at Volodia while he piled up the papers and put them in an\nopen chest beside him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my brother just out of school. We come to ask where the regiment\nis.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, rising to go into the tent. \xe2\x80\x9cCan I offer\nyou a little porter?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI agree to porter, Vassili Mikha\xc3\xaflovitch.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nVolodia, on whom a profound impression was produced by the grand airs of\nthe officer, as well as by his carelessness and by the respect his\nbrother showed him, said to himself timidly, sitting on the edge of the\nlounge, \xe2\x80\x9cThis officer, whom everybody respects, is doubtless a good\nfellow, hospitable, and probably very brave.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is our regiment, then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the elder brother from the officer,\nwho had disappeared in the tent.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the latter.\n\nThe other repeated his question.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw Seifer to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied; \xe2\x80\x9che told me it was in the fifth\nbastion.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it, sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I say so it is sure. However, devil take him! he lies cheaply\nenough! Say,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you have some porter?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would gladly take a drink,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Koseltzoff.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, Ossip Ignatievitch,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the same voice in the tent,\naddressing the sleeping commissary, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you have a drink? You have\nslept enough; it is almost five o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough of that old joke. You see well enough that I am not asleep,\xe2\x80\x9d\nreplied a shrill and lazy voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet up, then, for I am tired of it,\xe2\x80\x9d and the officer rejoined his\nguests. \xe2\x80\x9cGive us some Sympheropol porter!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted to his servant.\n\nThe latter, pushing against Volodia proudly, as it appeared to the young\nman, pulled out from under the bench a bottle of the porter called for.\n\nThe bottle had been empty some time, but the conversation was still\ngoing on, when the flap of the tent was put aside to let pass a small\nman in a blue dressing-gown with cord and tassel, and a cap trimmed with\nred braid and ornamented with a cockade.\n\nWith lowered eyes, and twisting his black mustache, he only replied to\nthe officer\xe2\x80\x99s salute by an imperceptible movement of the shoulders.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me a glass,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, sitting down near the table. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely you\nhave just come from Petersburg, young man?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, addressing Volodia\nwith an amiable air.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and I am going to Sebastopol.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf your own accord?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy in the devil are you going, then? Gentlemen, really I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nunderstand that,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the commissary. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me, if I could,\nI would go back to Petersburg on foot. I have had my bellyful of this\ncursed existence.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what are you grumbling at?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the elder Koseltzoff. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\nleading a very enviable life here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe commissary, surprised, cast a look at him, turned around, and\naddressing Volodia, said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis constant danger, these privations, for\nit is impossible to get anything--all that is terrible. I really cannot\nunderstand you, gentlemen. If you only got some advantage out of it! But\nis it agreeable, I ask you, to become at your age good-for-nothing for\nthe rest of your days?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome try to make money, some serve for honor,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Koseltzoff the\nelder, vexed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is honor when there is nothing to eat?\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the commissary,\nwith a disdainful smile, turning towards the officer of the wagon-train,\nwho followed his example. \xe2\x80\x9cWind up the music-box,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pointing to\na box. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll hear \xe2\x80\x98Lucia;\xe2\x80\x99 I like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this Vassili Mikha\xc3\xaflovitch a brave man,\xe2\x80\x9d Volodia asked his brother,\nwhen, twilight having fallen, they rolled again along the Sebastopol\nroad.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither good nor bad, but a terribly miserly fellow. As to the\ncommissary, I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to see even his picture. I shall knock him down\nsome day.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nIX.\n\nWhen they arrived, at nightfall, at the great bridge over the bay,\nVolodia was not exactly in bad humor, but a terrible weight lay on his\nheart. Everything he saw, everything he heard, harmonized so little with\nthe last impressions that had been left in his mind by the great, light\nexamination-hall with polished floor, the voices of his comrades and the\ngayety of their sympathetic bursts of laughter, his new uniform, the\nwell-beloved Czar, whom he was accustomed to see during seven years, and\nwho, taking leave of them with tears in his eyes, had called them \xe2\x80\x9chis\nchildren\xe2\x80\x9d--yes, everything he saw little harmonized with his rich dreams\nsparkling from a thousand facets.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere we are!\xe2\x80\x9d said his brother, getting out of the carriage in front of\nthe M---- battery. \xe2\x80\x9cIf they let us cross the bridge we will go straight\nto the Nicholas barracks. You will stop there until to-morrow morning.\nAs for me, I shall go back to my regiment to find out where the battery\nis, and to-morrow I will go and hunt you up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do that? rather let\xe2\x80\x99s go together,\xe2\x80\x9d said Volodia. \xe2\x80\x9cI will go to the\nbastion with you; won\xe2\x80\x99t that be the same thing? One must get accustomed\nto it. If you go there, why can\xe2\x80\x99t I go?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would do better not to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go--please do. At least I will see what it is--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI advise you not to go there; but, nevertheless--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe cloudless sky was sombre, the stars, and the flashes of the cannon,\nand the bombs flying in space, shone in the darkness. The _t\xc3\xaate du pont_\nand the great white pile of the battery came out sharply in the dark\nnight. Every instant reports, explosions, shook the air, together or\nseparately, ever louder, ever more distinct. The mournful murmur of the\nwaves played an accompaniment to this incessant roll. A fresh breeze\nfilled with moisture blew from the sea. The brothers approached the\nbridge. A soldier awkwardly shouldered arms and shouted,\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho comes there?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA soldier.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t pass.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible--we must pass!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk the officer.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe officer was taking a nap, seated on an anchor. He arose and gave the\norder to let them pass.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can go in, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t come out. Attention! Where are you getting\nto all together?\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted to the wagons piled up with gabions, which\nwere stopping at the entrance to the bridge.\n\nOn the first pontoon they met some soldiers talking in a loud voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has received his outfit; he has received it all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said another voice, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen a fellow gets to Severna\xc3\xafa he\nbegins to revive. There is quite another air here, by heavens!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat nonsense are you talking there?\xe2\x80\x9d said the first. \xe2\x80\x9cThe other day a\ncursed bomb-shell carried away the legs of two sailors. Oh! oh!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe water in several places was dashing into the second pontoon, where\nthe two brothers stopped to await their carriage. The wind, which had\nappeared light on land, blew here with violence and in gusts. The bridge\nswayed, and the waves, madly dashing against the beams, broke upon the\nanchors and the ropes and flooded the flooring. The sea roared with a\nhollow sound, forming a black, uniform, endless line, which separated it\nfrom the starry horizon, now lighted by a silvery glow. In the distance\ntwinkled the lights of the hostile fleet. On the left rose the dark mass\nof a sailing ship, against the sides of which the water dashed\nviolently; on the right, a steamer coming from Severna\xc3\xafa, noisily and\nswiftly advanced. A bomb-shell burst, and lighted up for a second the\nheaps of gabions, revealing two men standing on the deck of the ship, a\nthird in shirt-sleeves, sitting with swinging legs, busy repairing the\ndeck, and showing the white foam and the dashing waves with green\nreflections made by the steamer in motion.\n\nThe same lights continued to furrow the sky over Sebastopol, and the\nfear-inspiring sounds came nearer. A wave driven from the sea broke into\nfoam on the right side of the bridge and wet Volodia\xe2\x80\x99s feet. Two\nsoldiers, noisily dragging their legs through the water, passed by.\nSuddenly something burst with a crash and lighted up before them the\npart of the bridge along which was passing a carriage, followed by a\nsoldier on horseback. The pieces fell whistling into the water, which\nspouted up in jets.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Mikha\xc3\xafl Semenovitch!\xe2\x80\x9d said the horseman, drawing up before\nKoseltzoff the elder, \xe2\x80\x9chere you are--well again?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, as you see. Where in God\xe2\x80\x99s name are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Severna\xc3\xafa for cartridges. They send me in place of the aide-de-camp\nof the regiment. They are expecting an assault every moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Martzeff, where\xe2\x80\x99s he?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe lost a leg yesterday in the city; in his room. He was asleep. You\nknow him, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe regiment is in the fifth, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; it relieved the M----. Stop at the field-hospital, you will find\nour fellows there; they will show you the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave my quarters in the Morska\xc3\xafa been kept?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, brother, the shells destroyed them long since! You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\nrecognize Sebastopol any longer. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t a soul there; neither\nwomen, nor band, nor eating-house. The last caf\xc3\xa9 closed yesterday. It is\nnow so dismal! Good-by!\xe2\x80\x9d and the officer went away on the trot.\n\nA terrible fear suddenly seized Volodia. It seemed to him that a shell\nwas going to fall on him, and that a piece would surely strike him on\nthe head. The moist darkness, the sinister sounds, the constant noise of\nthe wrathful waves, all seemed to urge him to take not another step, and\nto tell him that no good awaited him there; that his foot would never\ntouch the solid earth on the other side of the bay; that he would do\nwell to turn back, to flee as quickly as possible this terrible place\nwhere death reigns. \xe2\x80\x9cWho knows? Perhaps it is too late. My lot is\nfixed.\xe2\x80\x9d He said this to himself, trembling at the thought, and also on\naccount of the water which was running into his boots. He sighed deeply,\nand kept away from his brother a little.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God! shall I really be killed--I? Oh, my God, have mercy on me!\xe2\x80\x9d he\nmurmured, making the sign of the cross.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we will push on, Volodia,\xe2\x80\x9d said his companion, when their carriage\nhad rejoined them. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you see the shell?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFarther on they met more wagons carrying wounded men and gabions. One of\nthem, filled with furniture, was driven by a woman. On the other side no\none stopped their passage.\n\nInstinctively hugging the wall of the Nicholas battery the two brothers\nsilently went along it, with ears attentive to the noise of the shells\nwhich exploded over their heads and to the roar of the pieces thrown\ndown from above; and at last they reached the part of the battery where\nthe holy image was placed. There they learned that the Fifth Light\nArtillery Regiment, which Volodia was to join, was at Korabelna\xc3\xafa. They\nconsequently made up their minds in spite of the danger to go and sleep\nin the fifth bastion, and to go from there to their battery on the next\nday. Passing through the narrow passage, stepping over the soldiers who\nwere sleeping along the wall, they at last reached the hospital.\n\n\nX.\n\nEntering the first room, filled with beds on which the wounded were\nlying, they were struck by the heavy and nauseating odor which is\npeculiar to hospitals. Two Sisters of Charity came to meet them. One of\nthem, about fifty years old, had a stern face; she held in her hands a\nbundle of bandages and lint, and was giving orders to a very young\nassistant-surgeon who was following her. The other, a pretty girl of\ntwenty, had a blond, pale, and delicate face. She appeared particularly\ngentle and timid under her little white cap; she followed her companion\nwith her hands in her apron-pockets, and it could be seen that she was\nafraid of stopping behind. Koseltzoff asked them to show him Martzeff,\nwho had lost a leg the day before.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf the P---- regiment?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the elder of the two sisters. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you a\nrelative?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, a comrade.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow them the way,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in French to the younger sister, and left\nthem, accompanied by the assistant-surgeon, to go to a wounded man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, what are you looking like that for?\xe2\x80\x9d said Koseltzoff to\nVolodia, who had stopped with raised eyebrows, and whose eyes, full of\npainful sympathy, could not leave the wounded, whom he watched without\nceasing, at the same time following his brother, and repeating, in spite\nof himself, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God! my God!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has just come in, has he not?\xe2\x80\x9d the young sister asked Koseltzoff,\npointing to Volodia.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he has just come.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe looked at him again and burst into tears, despairingly repeating,\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God! my God! when will it end?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey entered the officers\xe2\x80\x99 room. Martzeff was there, lying on his back,\nhis muscular arms bare to the elbow and held under his head. The\nexpression on his yellow visage was that of a man who shuts his teeth\ntightly so as not to cry out with pain. His well leg, with a stocking\non, stuck out from under the coverlid, and the toes worked convulsively.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, how do you feel?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the young sister, raising the wounded\nman\xe2\x80\x99s hot head and arranging his pillow with her thin fingers, on one of\nwhich Volodia espied a gold ring. \xe2\x80\x9cHere are your comrades come to see\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am suffering, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, with an irritated air. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\ntouch me; it is well as it is,\xe2\x80\x9d and the toes in the stocking moved with\na nervous action. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do? What\xe2\x80\x99s your name? Ah, pardon!\xe2\x80\x9d when\nKoseltzoff had told his name. \xe2\x80\x9cHere everything is forgotten.\nNevertheless we lived together,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, without expressing the least\njoy, and looking at Volodia with a questioning air.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my brother; he has just come from Petersburg.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! and I have done with it, I believe. Heavens, how I am suffering! If\nthat would only stop quicker!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe pulled his leg in with a convulsive movement. His toes worked with\ndouble restlessness. He covered his face with both hands.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must be left in quiet; he is very ill,\xe2\x80\x9d the sister whispered to\nthem. Her eyes were full of tears.\n\nThe brothers, who had decided to go to the fifth bastion, changed their\nminds on coming out of the hospital, and concluded, without telling each\nother the true reason, to separate, in order to not expose themselves to\nuseless danger.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you find your way, Volodia?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the elder. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, Nikola\xc3\xafeff\nwill lead you to Korabelna\xc3\xafa. Now I am going alone, and to-morrow I will\nbe with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThat was all they said in this last interview.\n\n\nXI.\n\nThe cannon roared with the same violence, but Ekatherinenska\xc3\xafa Street,\nthrough which Volodia went, accompanied by Nikola\xc3\xafeff, was empty and\nquiet. He could see in the darkness only the white walls standing in the\nmidst of the great overthrown houses, and the stones of the sidewalk he\nwas on. Sometimes he met soldiers and officers, and going along the left\nside, near the Admiralty, he noticed, by the bright light of a fire\nwhich burned behind a fence, a row of dark-leaved acacias, covered with\ndust, recently planted along the sidewalk and held up by green painted\nstakes. His steps and those of Nikola\xc3\xafeff, who was loudly breathing,\nresounded alone in the silence. His thoughts were vague. The pretty\nSister of Charity, Martzeff\xe2\x80\x99s leg, with his toes moving convulsively in\nhis stocking, the darkness, the shells, the different pictures of death,\npassed confusedly in his memory. His young and impressionable soul was\nirritated and wounded by his isolation, by the complete indifference of\nevery one to his lot, although he was exposed to danger. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall\nsuffer, I shall be killed, and no one will mourn me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to\nhimself. Where, then, was the life of the hero full of the energetic\nardor and of the sympathies he had so often dreamed of? The shells\nshrieked and burst nearer and nearer, and Nikola\xc3\xafeff sighed oftener\nwithout speaking. In crossing the bridge which led to Korabelna\xc3\xafa he saw\nsomething two steps off plunge whistling into the gulf, illuminating for\na second with a purple light the violet-tinted waves, and then bound\noff, throwing a shower of water into the air.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCurse it! the villain is still alive,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Nikola\xc3\xafeff.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Volodia, in spite of himself, and surprised at the sound\nof his own voice, so shrill and harsh.\n\nThey now met wounded men carried on stretchers, carts filled with\ngabions, a regiment, men on horseback. One of the latter, an officer\nfollowed by a Cossack, stopped at the sight of Volodia, examined his\nface, then, turning away, hit his horse with his whip and continued on\nhis way. \xe2\x80\x9cAlone, alone! whether I am alive or not, it is the same to\nall!\xe2\x80\x9d said the youth to himself, ready to burst into tears. Having\npassed a great white wall, he entered a street bordered with little,\nquite ruined houses, continually lighted up by the flash of the shells.\nA drunken woman in rags, followed by a sailor, came out of a small door\nand stumbled against him. \xe2\x80\x9cI beg pardon, your Excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\nThe poor boy\xe2\x80\x99s heart was more and more oppressed, while the flashes\ncontinually lit up the black horizon and the shells whistled and burst\nabout him. Suddenly Nikola\xc3\xafeff sighed, and spoke with a voice which\nseemed to Volodia to express a restrained terror.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was well worth while to hurry from home to come here! We went on and\nwent on, and what was the use of hurrying?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, thank the Lord! my brother is cured,\xe2\x80\x9d said Volodia, in order by\ntalking to drive away the horrible feeling which had got possession of\nhim.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFinely cured, when he is in a bad way altogether! The well ones would\nfind themselves much better off in the hospital in times like these. Do\nwe, perchance, take any pleasure in being here? Now an arm is lost, now\na leg, and then--And yet it is better here in the city than in the\nbastion, Lord God! On the way a man has to say all his prayers. Ah,\nscoundrel! it just hummed in my ears,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, listening to the sound\nof a piece of shell which had passed close to him. \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d continued\nNikola\xc3\xafeff, \xe2\x80\x9cI was told to lead your Excellency, and I know I must do\nwhat I am ordered to, but our carriage is in the care of a comrade, and\nthe bundles are undone. I was told to come, and I have come. But if any\none of the things we have brought is lost, it is I, Nikola\xc3\xafeff, who\nanswers for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA few steps farther on they came out on an open space.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is your artillery, your Excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly said. \xe2\x80\x9cAsk the\nsentinel, he will show you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nVolodia went forward alone. No longer hearing behind him Nikola\xc3\xafeff\xe2\x80\x99s\nsighs, he felt himself abandoned for good and all. The feeling of this\ndesertion in the presence of danger, of death, as he believed, oppressed\nhis heart with the glacial weight of a stone. Halting in the middle of\nthe place, he looked all about him to see if he was observed, and taking\nhis head in both hands, he murmured, with a voice broken by terror, \xe2\x80\x9cMy\nGod! am I really a despicable poltroon, a coward? I who have lately\ndreamed of dying for my country, for my Czar, and that with joy! Yes, I\nam an unfortunate and despicable being!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, in profound despair,\nand quite undeceived about himself. Having finally overcome his emotion,\nhe asked the sentinel to show him the house of the commander of the\nbattery.\n\n\nXII.\n\nThe commander of the battery lived in a little two-story house. It was\nentered through a court-yard. In one of the windows, in which a pane was\nmissing and was replaced by a sheet of paper, shone the feeble light of\na candle. The servant, seated in the door-way, was smoking his pipe.\nHaving announced Volodia to his master, he showed him into his room.\nThere, between two windows, beside a broken mirror, was seen a table\nloaded with official papers, several chairs, an iron bed with clean\nlinen and a rug before it. Near the door stood the sergeant-major, a\nfine man, with a splendid pair of mustaches, his sword in its belt. On\nhis coat sparkled a cross and the medal of the Hungary campaign. The\nstaff-officer, small in stature, with a swollen and bandaged cheek,\nwalked up and down, dressed in a frock-coat of fine cloth which bore\nmarks of long wear. He was decidedly corpulent, and appeared about forty\nyears old. A bald spot was clearly marked on the top of his head; his\nthick mustache, hanging straight down, hid his mouth; his brown eyes had\nan agreeable expression; his hands were fine, white, a little fat; his\nfeet, very much turned out, were put down with a certain assurance and a\ncertain affectation which proved that bashfulness was not the weak side\nof the commander.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have the honor to present myself. I am attached to the Fifth Light\nBattery--Koseltzoff, the second-ensign,\xe2\x80\x9d said Volodia, who, entering the\nroom, recited in one breath this lesson learned by heart.\n\nThe commander of the battery replied by a somewhat dry salute, and\nwithout offering him his hand begged him to be seated. Volodia then sat\ndown timidly near the writing-table, and in his distraction getting hold\nof a pair of scissors, began to play with them mechanically. With hands\nbehind his back and with bowed head, the commander of the battery\ncontinued his promenade in silence, casting his eyes from time to time\non the fingers which continued to juggle with the scissors.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, stopping at last in front of the sergeant-major, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom\nto-morrow on we must give another measure of oats to the caisson horses;\nthey are thin. What do you think of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? It can be done, your High Excellency; oats are now cheaper,\xe2\x80\x9d\nreplied the sergeant-major, his arms stuck to the side of his body and\nhis fingers stirring--an habitual movement with which he usually\naccompanied his conversation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen there is the forage-master, Frantzone, who wrote me a line\nyesterday, your High Excellency. He said we must buy axle-trees without\nfail; they are cheap. What are your orders?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, they must be bought; there is money,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the commander,\ncontinuing to walk. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are your traps?\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly said, pausing\nbefore Volodia.\n\nPoor Volodia, pursued by the thought that he was a coward, saw in each\nlook, in each word, the scorn he must inspire; and it seemed to him that\nhis chief had already discovered his sad secret, and that he was jeering\nat him. Then he replied in confusion that his things were at Grafskaia,\nand that his brother would send them to him the following day.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere shall we put up the ensign?\xe2\x80\x9d the lieutenant-colonel asked the\nsergeant-major, without listening to the young man\xe2\x80\x99s answer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe ensign?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the sergeant-major. A rapid glance thrown on\nVolodia, and which seemed to say, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of an ensign is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\nfinished the disconcerting of the latter. \xe2\x80\x9cDown there, your Excellency,\nwith the second-captain. Since the captain is in the bastion his bed is\nempty!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill that do for you while you are waiting?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the commander of the\nbattery. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must be tired, I think. To-morrow it can be more\nconveniently arranged for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nVolodia arose and saluted.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you have some tea?\xe2\x80\x9d added his superior officer. \xe2\x80\x9cThe samovar can\nbe heated.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nVolodia, who had already reached the door, turned around, saluted again,\nand went out.\n\nThe lieutenant-colonel\xe2\x80\x99s servant conducted him down-stairs, and showed\nhim into a bare and dirty room where different broken things were thrown\naside as rubbish, and in which, in a corner, a man in a red shirt, whom\nVolodia took for a soldier, was sleeping on an iron bed without sheets\nor coverlid, wrapped in his overcoat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeter Nikola\xc3\xafevitch\xe2\x80\x9d--and the servant touched the sleeper\xe2\x80\x99s\nshoulder--\xe2\x80\x9cget up; the ensign is going to sleep here. It\xe2\x80\x99s Vlang, our\nyunker,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, turning to Volodia.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t disturb yourself, I beg,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the latter, seeing the\nyunker, a tall and robust young man, with a fine face, but one entirely\ndevoid of intelligence, rise, throw his overcoat over his shoulders, and\ndrowsily go away, murmuring, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s nothing; I will go and sleep in the\nyard.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nXIII.\n\nLeft alone with his thoughts, Volodia at first felt a return of the\nterror caused by the trouble which agitated his soul. Counting upon\nsleep to be able to cease thinking of his surroundings and to forget\nhimself, he blew out his candle and lay down, covering himself all up\nwith his overcoat, even his head, for he had kept his fear of darkness\nsince his childhood. But suddenly the idea came to him that a shell\nmight fall through the roof and kill him. He listened. The commander of\nthe battery was walking up and down over his head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will begin by killing him first,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cthen me. I\nshall not die alone!\xe2\x80\x9d This reflection calmed him, and he was going to\nsleep when this time the thought that Sebastopol might be taken that\nvery night, that the French might burst in his door, and that he had no\nweapon to defend himself, completely waked him up again. He rose and\nwalked the room. The fear of the real danger had stifled the mysterious\nterror of darkness. He hunted and found to hand only a saddle and a\nsamovar. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a coward, a poltroon, a wretch,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought again, filled\nwith disgust and scorn of himself. He lay down and tried to stop\nthinking; but then the impressions of the day passed again through his\nmind, and the continual sounds which shook the panes of his single\nwindow recalled to him the danger he was in. Visions followed. Now he\nsaw the wounded covered with blood; now bursting shells, pieces of which\nflew into his room; now the pretty Sister of Charity who dressed his\nwounds weeping over his agony, or his mother, who, carrying him back to\nthe provincial town, praying to God for him before a miraculous image,\nshed hot tears. Sleep eluded him; but suddenly the thought of an\nall-powerful Deity who sees everything and who hears every prayer\nflashed upon him distinct and clear in the midst of his reveries. He\nfell upon his knees, making the sign of the cross, and clasping his\nhands as he had been taught in his childhood. This simple gesture\naroused in him a feeling of infinite, long-forgotten calm.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I am to die, it is because I am useless! Then, may Thy will be done,\nO Lord! and may it be done quickly. But if the courage and firmness\nwhich I lack are necessary to me, spare me the shame and the dishonor,\nwhich I cannot endure, and teach me what I must do to accomplish Thy\nwill.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHis weak, childish, and terrified soul was fortified, was calmed at\nonce, and entered new, broad, and luminous regions. He thought of a\nthousand things; he experienced a thousand sensations in the short\nduration of this feeling; then he quietly went to sleep, heedless of the\ndull roar of the bombardment and of the shaking windows.\n\nLord, Thou alone hast heard, Thou alone knowest the simple but ardent\nand despairing prayers of ignorance, the confused repentance asking for\nthe cure of the body and the purification of the soul--the prayers which\nrise to Thee from these places where death resides; beginning with the\ngeneral, who with terror feels a presentiment of approaching death, and\na second after thinks only of wearing a cross of Saint George on his\nneck, and ending with the simple soldier prostrate on the bare earth of\nthe Nicholas battery, supplicating Thee to grant him for his sufferings\nthe recompense he unconsciously has a glimpse of.\n\n\nXIV.\n\nThe elder Koseltzoff, having met a soldier of his regiment in the\nstreet, was accompanied by him to the fifth bastion.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep close to the wall, Excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d the soldier said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is dangerous, Excellency. _He_ is already passing over us,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\nthe soldier, listening to the whistling of the ball, which struck with a\ndry sound the other side of the hard road. But Koseltzoff continued on\nin the middle of the road without heeding this advice. There were the\nsame streets, the same but more frequent flashes, the same sounds and\nthe same groans, the same meeting of wounded men, the same batteries,\nparapet, and trenches, just as he had seen them in the spring. But now\ntheir aspect was more dismal, more sombre and more martial, so to speak.\nA greater number of houses was riddled, and there were no more lights in\nthe windows--the hospital was the only exception--no more women in the\nstreet; and the character of the accustomed, careless life formerly\nimprinted on everything was effaced, and was replaced by the element of\nanxious, weary expectation, and of redoubled and incessant effort.\n\nHe came at last to the farthermost intrenchment, and a soldier of the\nP---- regiment recognized his former company chief. There was the third\nbattalion, as could be guessed in the darkness by the constrained murmur\nof voices and the clicks of the muskets placed against the wall, which\nthe flash of the discharges lit up at frequent intervals.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the commander of the regiment?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Koseltzoff.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the bomb-proof with the marines, your Excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the\nobliging soldier. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you would like to go I will show you the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPassing from one trench to another, he led Koseltzoff to the ditch,\nwhere a sailor was smoking his pipe. Behind him was a door, through the\ncracks of which shone a light.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan we go in?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will announce you;\xe2\x80\x9d and the sailor entered the bomb-proof, where two\nvoices could be heard.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Prussia continues to keep neutral, then Austria--\xe2\x80\x9d said one of them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is Austria good for when the slavs--\xe2\x80\x9d said the other.--\xe2\x80\x9cAh yes!\nask him to come in,\xe2\x80\x9d added this same voice.\n\nKoseltzoff, who had never before put his foot in these bomb-proof\nquarters, was struck by their elegance. A polished floor took the place\nof boards, a screen hid the entrance door. In a corner was a great icon\nrepresenting the holy Virgin, with its gilt frame lighted by a small\npink glass lamp. Two beds were placed along the wall, on one of which a\nnaval officer was sleeping in his clothes, on the other, near a table on\nwhich two open bottles of wine were standing, sat the new regimental\nchief and an aide-de-camp. Koseltzoff, who was not bashful, and who felt\nhimself in nowise guilty, either towards the State or towards the chief\nof the regiment, felt, nevertheless, at the sight of the latter--his\ncomrade until very recently--a certain apprehension.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is strange,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, seeing him rise to listen to him. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has\ncommanded the regiment scarcely six weeks, and power is already visible\nin his bearing, in his look, in his clothes. Not a long while ago this\nsame Batretcheff amused himself in our quarters, wore for whole weeks\nthe same dark calico shirt, and ate his hash and his sour cream without\ninviting any one to share it, and now an expression full of hard pride\ncan be read in his eyes, which say to me, \xe2\x80\x98Although I am your comrade,\nfor I am a regimental chief of the new school, you may be sure I know\nperfectly well that you would give half your life to be in my place.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been treating yourself to a rather long absence,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\ncolonel, coldly, looking at him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been ill, colonel, and my wound is not yet altogether healed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that\xe2\x80\x99s so, what did you come back for?\xe2\x80\x9d Koseltzoff\xe2\x80\x99s corpulence\ninspired his chief with defiance. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you do your duty?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. Ensign Za\xc3\xaftzeff will conduct you to the ninth company, the\none you have already commanded. You will receive the order of the day.\nBe so good as to send me the regimental aide-de-camp as you go out,\xe2\x80\x9d and\nhis chief, bowing slightly, gave him to understand by this that the\ninterview was ended.\n\nOn his way out Koseltzoff muttered indistinct words and shrugged his\nshoulders several times. It might readily be believed that he felt ill\nat ease, or that he was irritated, not exactly against his regimental\nchief, but rather against himself and against all his surroundings.\n\n\nXV.\n\nBefore going to find his officers he went to look up his company. The\nparapets built of gabions, the trenches, the cannon in front of which he\npassed, even the fragments and the shells themselves over which he\nstumbled, and which the flashes of the discharges lighted up without\npause or relaxation, everything was familiar to him, and had been deeply\nengraven on his memory three months before, during the fortnight he had\nlived in the bastion. Notwithstanding the dismal side of these memories,\na certain inherent charm of the past came out of them, and he recognized\nthe places and things with an unaffected pleasure, as if the two weeks\nhad been full of only agreeable impressions. His company was placed\nalong the covered way which led to the sixth bastion.\n\nEntering the shelter open on one side, he found so many soldiers there\nthat he could scarcely find room to pass. At one end burned a wretched\ncandle, which a reclining soldier was holding over a book that his\ncomrade was spelling out. Around him, in the twilight of a thick and\nheavy atmosphere, several heads could be seen turned towards the reader,\nlistening eagerly. Koseltzoff recognized the A B C of this sentence:\n\xe2\x80\x9cP-r-a-y-e-r a-f-t-e-r s-t-u-d-y. I give Thee thanks, my Cre-a-tor.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSnuff the candle!\xe2\x80\x9d some one shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a good book!\xe2\x80\x9d said the\nreader, preparing to go on. But at the sound of Koseltzoff\xe2\x80\x99s voice\ncalling the sergeant-major it was silent. The soldiers moved, coughed,\nand blew their noses, as always happens after an enforced silence. The\nsergeant-major arose from the middle of the group, buttoning his\nuniform, stepping over his comrades, and trampling on their feet, which\nfor lack of room they did not know where to stow, approached the\nofficer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do, my boy? Is this our company?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHealth to your Excellency! We congratulate you on your return,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\nthe sergeant-major, gayly and good-naturedly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are cured,\nExcellency? God be praised for that! for we missed you a good deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKoseltzoff, it was evident, was beloved by his company. Voices could\nimmediately be heard spreading the news that the old company chief had\ncome back, he who had been wounded--Mikha\xc3\xafl Semenovitch Koseltzoff.\nSeveral soldiers, the drummer among others, came to greet him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do, Obanetchouk?\xe2\x80\x9d said Koseltzoff. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you safe and sound?\nHow do you do, children?\xe2\x80\x9d he then added, raising his voice.\n\nThe soldiers replied in chorus,\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHealth to your Excellency!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow goes it, children?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBadly, your Excellency. The French have the upper hands. He fires from\nbehind the intrenchments, but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t show himself outside.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, then, who knows? perhaps I shall have the chance of seeing him\ncome out of the intrenchments, children. It won\xe2\x80\x99t be the first time we\nhave fought him together.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are ready to do our best, your Excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d said several voices at\nthe same time.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is very bold, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTerribly bold,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the drummer in a low tone, but so as to be\nheard, and speaking to another soldier, as if to justify his chief for\nhaving made use of the expression, and to persuade his comrade that\nthere was nothing exaggerated nor untrue in it.\n\nKoseltzoff left the soldiers in order to join the officers in the\nbarracks.\n\n\nXVI.\n\nThe great room of the barracks was filled with people--a crowd of naval,\nartillery, and infantry officers. Some were sleeping, others were\ntalking, seated on a caisson or on the carriage of a siege-gun. The\nlargest group of the three, seated on their cloaks spread on the ground,\nwere drinking porter and playing cards.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Koseltzoff\xe2\x80\x99s come back! Bravo! And your wound?\xe2\x80\x9d said divers voices\nfrom different sides.\n\nHere also he was liked, and they were rejoiced at his return.\n\nAfter having shaken hands with his acquaintances, Koseltzoff joined the\ngay group of card-players. One of them, thin, with a long nose, and a\nlarge mustache which encroached on his cheeks, cut the cards with his\nwhite, slender fingers on one of which was a great seal ring. He seemed\ndisturbed, and dealt with an affected carelessness. On his right, lying\nhalf raised on his elbow, a gray-haired major staked and paid a\nhalf-ruble every time with exaggerated calmness. On his left, crouching\non his heels, an officer with a red and shining face joked and smiled\nwith an effort, and when his card was laid down, one of his hands moved\nin the empty pocket of his trousers. He played a heavy game, but without\nany money--a fact which visibly irritated the dark officer with the\nhandsome face. Another officer, pale, thin, and bald, with an enormous\nnose and a large mouth, walking about the room with a bundle of\nbank-notes in his hand, counted down the money on the bank and won every\ntime.\n\nKoseltzoff drank a small glass of brandy and sat down beside the\nplayers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Mikha\xc3\xafl Semenovitch, come; put up your stake!\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer\nwho was cutting the cards; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll bet you have brought back a lot of\nmoney.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere could I have got it? On the contrary, I spent my last penny in\ntown!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally! You must have fleeced some one at Sympheropol, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an idea!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Koseltzoff, not wanting his words to be\nbelieved, and unbuttoning his uniform, to be more comfortable, he took a\nfew old cards.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to risk, but, devil take me! who can foresee luck? A\ngnat can sometimes accomplish wonders! Let\xe2\x80\x99s go on drinking to keep our\ncourage up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShortly after he swallowed a second small glass of brandy, a little\nporter into the bargain, and lost his last three rubles, while a hundred\nand fifty were charged to the account of the little officer with the\nsweat-moistened face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave the kindness to send me the money,\xe2\x80\x9d said the banker, interrupting\nthe deal to look at him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllow me to put off sending it until to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the one\naddressed, rising. His hand was nervously moving in his empty pocket.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHum!\xe2\x80\x9d said the banker, spitefully throwing the last cards of the pack\nright and left. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t play in this way,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined; \xe2\x80\x9cI will stop\nthe game. It can\xe2\x80\x99t be done, Zakhar Ivanovitch. We are playing cash down,\nand not for credit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you distrust me? That would be strange indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom whom have I to get eight rubles?\xe2\x80\x9d the major who had just won asked\nat this moment. \xe2\x80\x9cI have paid out more than twenty, and when I win I get\nnothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you think I can pay you when there is no money on the table?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the major, rising. \xe2\x80\x9cI am playing with you,\nand not with this gentleman!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs long as I tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the perspiring officer--\xe2\x80\x9cas long as I tell\nyou I will pay you to-morrow, how do you dare insult me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll say what I like. This is no way of doing!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the major,\nexcited.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, be quiet, F\xc3\xa9dor F\xc3\xa9dorovitch!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted several players at once,\nturning around.\n\nLet us drop the curtain on this scene. To-morrow, perhaps to-day, each\nof these men will go to meet death gayly, proudly, and will die calmly\nand firmly. The only consolation of a life the conditions of which\nfreeze with horror the coldest imagination, of a life which has nothing\nhuman in it, to which all hope is interdicted, is forgetfulness,\nannihilation of the consciousness of the reality. In the soul of every\nman lies dormant the noble spark which at the proper time will make a\nhero of him; but this spark grows tired of shining always. Nevertheless,\nwhen the fatal moment comes, it will burst into a flame which will\nillumine grand deeds.\n\n\nXVII.\n\nThe next day the bombardment continued with the same violence. About\neleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the forenoon Volodia Koseltzoff joined the officers of\nhis battery. He became accustomed to these new faces, asked them\nquestions, and, in his turn, shared his impressions with them. The\nmodest but slightly pedantic conversation of the artillery-men pleased\nhim and inspired his respect. On the other hand, his own sympathetic\nappearance, his timid manner, and his simplicity predisposed these\ngentlemen in his favor. The oldest officer of the battery, a short,\nred-haired captain with a foretop, and with well-smoothed locks on his\ntemples, brought up in the old traditions of artillery, amiable with\nladies, and posing for a savant, asked him questions about his\nacquaintance with this science or that, about the new inventions, joked\nin an affectionate way about his youth and his handsome face, and\ntreated him like a son, all of which charmed Volodia. Sub-lieutenant\nDedenko, a young officer with an accent of Little Russia, with shaggy\nhair and a torn overcoat, pleased him also, in spite of his loud voice,\nhis frequent quarrels, and his brusque movements, for under this rude\nexterior Volodia saw a brave and worthy man. Dedenko eagerly offered his\nservices to Volodia, and tried to prove to him that the cannon at\nSebastopol had not been placed according to rule. On the other hand,\nLieutenant Tchernovitzky, with high-arched eyebrows, who wore a\nwell-cared-for but worn and mended overcoat, and a gold chain on a satin\nwaistcoat, did not inspire him with any sympathy, although superior to\nthe others in politeness. He continually asked Volodia details about the\nemperor, the minister of war, related with factitious enthusiasm the\nheroic exploits accomplished at Sebastopol, expressed his regrets at the\nsmall number of true patriots, made a show of a great deal of knowledge,\nof wit, of exceedingly noble sentiments, but in spite of all that, and\nwithout being able to tell why, all these discourses sounded false in\nhis ears, and he even noticed that the officers in general avoided\nspeaking to Tchernovitzky. The yunker, Vlang, whom he had waked up the\nevening before, sat modestly in a corner, kept silent, laughed sometimes\nat a joke, always ready to recall what had been forgotten, presented to\nthe officers in turn the small glass of brandy, and rolled cigarettes\nfor all. Charmed by the simple and polite manners of Volodia, who did\nnot treat him like a boy, and by his agreeable appearance, his great,\nfine eyes never left the face of the new-comer. Urged by a feeling of\ngreat admiration, he divined and forestalled all his wishes, a fact\nwhich the officers immediately noticed, and which furnished the subject\nof unsparing jokes.\n\nA little before dinner second-captain Kraut, relieved from duty on the\nbastion, joined the little company. A blond, fine-looking fellow, of a\nlively turn of mind, proud possessor of a pair of red mustaches, and\nside-whiskers of the same color, he spoke the language to perfection,\nbut too correctly and too elegantly for a pure-blooded Russian. Quite as\nirreproachable in duty as in his private life, perfection was his\nfailing. A perfect comrade, to be counted on beyond proof in all affairs\nof interest, he lacked something as a man, just because everything in\nhim was an accomplishment. In striking contrast with the ideal Germans\nof Germany, he was, after the example of the Russian Germans, in the\nhighest degree practical.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere he is! here\xe2\x80\x99s our hero!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the captain at the moment Kraut\ncame in, gesticulating and clanking his spurs. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99ll you have,\nFrederic Christianovitch--tea or brandy?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am having some tea made, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t refuse brandy while I am\nwaiting, for my soul\xe2\x80\x99s consolation! Happy to make your acquaintance!\nPlease get fond of us, and be well-disposed towards us,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to\nVolodia, who had arisen to salute him. \xe2\x80\x9cSecond-captain Kraut! The\nartificer told me you came last evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllow me to thank you for your bed, which I profited by last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you at least sleep comfortably there? Because one of the legs is\ngone, and no one can repair it during the siege. You have to keep\nwedging it up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo then you got out of it safely?\xe2\x80\x9d Dedenko asked him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, thank God! but Skvortzoff was hit. We had to repair one of the\ncarriages; the side of it was smashed to pieces.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe suddenly arose and walked up and down. It could be seen that he felt\nthe agreeable sensation of a man who has just come safe and sound out of\ngreat danger.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Dmitri Gavrilovitch,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, tapping the captain\xe2\x80\x99s knee in a\nfriendly manner, \xe2\x80\x9chow are you, brother? What has become of your\npresentation for advancement? Has it finally been settled?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; nothing has come of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd nothing will come of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dedenko; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve proved it to you\nalready.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy will nothing come of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause your statement is badly made.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, what a violent wrangler!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kraut, gayly. \xe2\x80\x9cA truly obstinate\nLittle Russian. All right; you will see that they will make you\nlieutenant to pay for your mortification.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, they won\xe2\x80\x99t do anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVlang,\xe2\x80\x9d added Kraut, speaking to the yunker, \xe2\x80\x9cfill my pipe and bring it\nto me, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKraut\xe2\x80\x99s presence had waked them all up. Chatting with each one, he gave\nthe details of the bombardment, and asked questions about what had taken\nplace during his absence.\n\n\nXVIII.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, then, are you settled?\xe2\x80\x9d Kraut asked of Volodia. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, pardon me,\nwhat is your name--both your names? It\xe2\x80\x99s our custom in the artillery.\nHave you a saddle-horse?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Volodia, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am much troubled about it. I have spoken\nto the captain. I shall have neither horse nor money until I get my\nforage-money and my travelling expenses. I would like to ask the\ncommander of the battery to lend me his horse, but I am afraid he will\nrefuse.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would like to ask this of Apollo Sergu\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaftch?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kraut, looking\nat the captain, while he made a sound with his lips which expressed\ndoubt.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the latter, \xe2\x80\x9cif he refuses, there is no great harm done. To\ntell the truth, there is seldom need of a horse here. I will undertake\nto ask him to-day even.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dedenko. \xe2\x80\x9cHe would refuse anything else, but\nhe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t refuse his horse to this gentleman. Would you like to bet on\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know you are ripe for contradiction, you--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI contradict when I know a thing! He isn\xe2\x80\x99t generous usually, but he\nwill lend his horse, because he has no interest in refusing it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow no interest? When oats cost eight rubles here it is evidently in\nhis interest. He will have one horse the less to keep.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVladimir Semenovitch!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Vlang, coming back with Kraut\xe2\x80\x99s pipe. \xe2\x80\x9cAsk\nfor the spotted one; it is a charming horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the one you fell into the ditch with, eh, Vlang?\xe2\x80\x9d observed the\nsecond-captain.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are mistaken in saying that oats are eight rubles,\xe2\x80\x9d maintained\nDedenko, in the mean time, continuing the discussion. \xe2\x80\x9cAccording to the\nlatest news they are ten-fifty. It is evident that there is no profit\nin--\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would like to leave him nothing, then? If you were in his place you\nwould not lend your horse to go into town either. When I am commander of\nthe battery my horses, brother, will have four full measures to eat\nevery day! I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t think of making an income, rest assured!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe who lives will see,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the second-captain. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will do the\nsame when you have a battery, and he also,\xe2\x80\x9d pointing to Volodia.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you suppose, Frederic Christianovitch, that this gentleman would\nalso like to reserve for himself some small profit? If he has a certain\namount of money, what will he do it for?\xe2\x80\x9d Tchernovitzky asked in his\nturn.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--I--excuse me, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Volodia, blushing up to his ears.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be dishonest in my eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! oh! what milk porridge!\xe2\x80\x9d Kraut said to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is another question, captain, but it seems to me that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\ntake money for myself which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t belong to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I will tell you something else,\xe2\x80\x9d said the second-captain, in a more\nserious tone. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must learn that, being battery commander, there is\nevery advantage in managing affairs well. You must know that the\nsoldier\xe2\x80\x99s food doesn\xe2\x80\x99t concern him. It has always been that way with us\nin the artillery. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t succeed in making both ends meet, you\nwill have nothing left. Let us count up your expenses. You have first\nthe forage\xe2\x80\x9d--and the captain bent one finger; \xe2\x80\x9cnext the medicine\xe2\x80\x9d--he\nbent a second one; \xe2\x80\x9cthen the administration--that makes three; then the\ndraft-horses, which certainly cost five hundred rubles--that makes four;\nthen the refitting of the soldiers\xe2\x80\x99 collars; then the charcoal, which is\nused in great quantities, and at last the table of your officers;\nlastly, as chief of the battery you must live comfortably, and you need\na carriage, a cloak, etc.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the principal thing is this, Vladimir Semenovitch,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\ncaptain, who had been silent up to this moment. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at a man like me,\nfor example, who has served twenty years, receiving at first two, then\nthree hundred rubles pay. Well, then, why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the Government\nreward him for his years of service by giving him a morsel of bread for\nhis old days.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t be discussed,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the second-captain; \xe2\x80\x9cso don\xe2\x80\x99t be in a\nhurry to judge. Serve a little while and you will see.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nVolodia, quite ashamed of the remark which he had thrown out without\nstopping to reflect, murmured a few words, and listened in silence how\nDedenko set about defending the opposite thesis. The discussion was\ninterrupted by the entrance of the colonel\xe2\x80\x99s orderly announcing that\ndinner was ready.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to tell Apollo Sergu\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaftch to give us wine to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nCaptain Tchernovitzky, buttoning his coat. \xe2\x80\x9cDevil take his avarice! He\nwill be shot, and no one will get any.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, you are my elder; the hierarchy before everything!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nXIX.\n\nA table, covered with a stained tablecloth, was placed in the middle of\nthe room in which Volodia had been received by the colonel the evening\nbefore. The latter gave him his hand, and asked him questions about\nPetersburg and about his journey.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, gentlemen, please come up to the brandy. The ensigns don\xe2\x80\x99t drink,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe added, with a smile.\n\nThe commander of the battery did not seem as stern to-day as the day\nbefore; he had rather the air of a kind and hospitable host than that of\na comrade among his officers. In spite of that, all, from the old\ncaptain to Ensign Dedenko, evinced respect for him which betrayed itself\nin the timid politeness with which they spoke to him and came up in line\nto drink their little glass of brandy.\n\nThe dinner consisted of cabbage-soup, served in a great tureen in which\nswam lumps of meat with fat attached, laurel leaves, and a good deal of\npepper, Polish _zrasi_ with mustard, _koldouni_ with slightly rancid\nbutter; no napkins; the spoons were of pewter and of wood, the glasses\nwere two in number. On the table was a single water decanter with broken\nneck. The conversation did not flag. They first spoke of the battle of\nInkerman, in which the battery took a part. Each related his\nimpressions, his opinions on the causes of the failure, keeping silent\nas soon as the battery commander spoke. Then they complained of the lack\nof cannon of a certain calibre; they talked of certain other\nimprovements, which gave Volodia an opportunity of showing his\nknowledge. The curious part was that the talk did not even touch upon\nthe frightful situation of Sebastopol, which seemed to mean that each\none, on his part, thought too much about it to speak of it.\n\nVolodia, very much astonished, and even vexed, that there was no\nquestion of the duties of his service, said to himself that he seemed to\nhave come to Sebastopol only in order to give the details about the new\ncannon and to dine with the battery commander.\n\nDuring the repast a shell burst very near the house. The floor and the\nwall were shaken by it as by an earthquake, and powder-smoke spread over\nthe window outside.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou certainly didn\xe2\x80\x99t see that at Petersburg, but here we often have\nthese surprises. Go, Vlang,\xe2\x80\x9d added the commander, \xe2\x80\x9cand see where the\nshell burst.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nVlang went to look, and announced that it had burst in the yard. After\nthat they did not speak of it again.\n\nA little before the end of the dinner one of the military clerks came in\nto give to his chief three sealed envelopes. \xe2\x80\x9cThis one is very urgent. A\nCossack has just brought it from the commander of the artillery,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid. The officers watched the practised fingers of their superior with\nanxious impatience while he broke the seal of the envelope, which bore\nthe words \xe2\x80\x9cin haste,\xe2\x80\x9d and drew a paper from it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can that be?\xe2\x80\x9d each one thought. \xe2\x80\x9cCan it be the order to leave\nSebastopol for a rest, or the order to bring out the whole battery upon\nthe bastion?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce more!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the commander, angrily, throwing the sheet of paper\non the table.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, Apollo Sergu\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaftch?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the oldest of the officers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey want an officer and men for a mortar battery. I have only four\nofficers, and my men are not up to the full number,\xe2\x80\x9d he growled, \xe2\x80\x9cand\nnow they ask for some of them. However, some one must go, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d he\ncontinued, after a moment; \xe2\x80\x9cthey must be there at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Send me\nthe sergeant-major. Now, gentlemen, who will go? Decide it among\nyourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut here is this gentleman who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet served,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tchernovitzky,\npointing to Volodia.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask for anything better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Volodia, feeling a cold\nsweat moisten his neck and his backbone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--why not?\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one ought to refuse; but it\nis useless to ask him to go; and since Apollo Sergu\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaftch leaves us free,\nwe will draw lots, as we did the other time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAll consented to this. Kraut carefully cut several little paper squares,\nrolled them up, and threw them into a cap. The captain cracked a few\njokes and profited by this occasion to ask the colonel for wine, \xe2\x80\x9cto\ngive us courage,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. Dedenko had a depressed air, Volodia smiled,\nTchernovitzky declared that he would be chosen by the lot. As to Kraut,\nhe was perfectly calm.\n\nThey offered Volodia the first chance. He took one of the papers, the\nlongest, but immediately changed it for another, shorter and smaller,\nand unrolling it, read the word \xe2\x80\x9cGo.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is I,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a sigh.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. May God protect you! It will be your baptism of fire,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nthe commander, looking with a pleasant smile at the disturbed face of\nthe ensign. \xe2\x80\x9cBut get ready quickly, and in order that it may be\npleasanter, Vlang will go with you in the place of the artificer.\n\n\nXX.\n\nVlang, delighted with his mission, ran away to dress, and came back at\nonce to assist Volodia to make up his bundles, advising him to take his\nbed, his fur cloak, an old number of the \xe2\x80\x9cAnnals of the Country,\xe2\x80\x9d a\ncoffee-pot with an alcohol lamp, and other useless articles. The\ncaptain, in his turn, advised Volodia to read in the \xe2\x80\x9cManual for the\nuse of Artillery Officers\xe2\x80\x9d the passage relating to firing mortars, and\nto copy it at once! Volodia set himself to work at it immediately, happy\nand surprised to feel that the dread of danger, especially the fear of\npassing for a coward, was less strong than on the evening before. His\nimpressions of the day and his occupation had partly contributed to\ndiminish the violence of this; and then it is well known that an acute\nsensation cannot last long without weakening. In a word, his fear was\nbeing cured. At seven in the evening, at the moment the sun was setting\nbehind the Nicholas barracks, the sergeant-major came to tell him that\nthe men were ready, and were waiting for him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have given the list to Vlang, your Excellency; you can ask him for\nit,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust I make a little speech to them?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Volodia, on his way,\naccompanied by the yunker, to join the twenty artillery-men who, swords\nby their sides, were waiting for him outside--\xe2\x80\x9cor must I simply say to\nthem, \xe2\x80\x98How do you do, children?\xe2\x80\x99 or, indeed, say nothing at all? Why not\nsay \xe2\x80\x98How do you do, children?\xe2\x80\x99 I think I ought to;\xe2\x80\x9d and with his full\nand sonorous voice he cried boldly, \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do, children?\xe2\x80\x9d The\nsoldiers replied cheerfully to his salutation; his young and fresh voice\nsounded agreeably in their ears. He put himself at their head, and\nalthough his heart was beating as if he had just run several furlongs,\nhis walk was light and his face was smiling. When they got near the\nMalakoff mamelon, he noticed, while climbing up it, that Vlang, who did\nnot leave his heels, and who had seemed so courageous down below in\ntheir quarters, stooped and ducked his head as if the bullets and shells\nwhich were whistling without cessation were coming straight towards him.\nSeveral soldiers did the same, and the majority of the faces expressed,\nif not fear, at least disquiet. This circumstance reassured him and\nrevived his courage.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere I am, then, I also, on the Malakoff mamelon. I imagined it a\nthousand times more terrible, and I am walking, I am advancing, without\nsaluting the bullets! I am less afraid than the others, and I am not a\ncoward, then,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself joyfully, with the enthusiasm of\nsatisfied self-love.\n\nThis feeling was, however, shaken by the spectacle that presented itself\nto his eyes. When he reached in the twilight the Korniloff battery, four\nsailors, some holding by the legs, others by the arms, the bloody corpse\nof a man with bare feet and no coat, were in the act of throwing him\nover the parapet. (The second day of the bombardment they threw the dead\ninto the ditch, because they had no time to carry them off.) Volodia,\nstupefied, saw the corpse strike the upper part of the rampart, and\nslide from there into the ditch. Fortunately for him, he met at this\nvery moment the commander of the bastion, who gave him a guide to lead\nhim to the battery and into the bomb-proof quarters of the men. We will\nnot relate how often our hero was exposed to danger during that night.\nWe will say nothing of how he was undeceived when he noticed that\ninstead of finding them firing here according to the precise rules such\nas they practise at Petersburg on the plain of Volkovo, he saw himself\nin front of two broken mortars, one with its muzzle bruised by a shell,\nthe other still upright on the pieces of a destroyed platform. We will\nnot tell how it was impossible for him to get the soldiers in order to\nrepair it before daylight, how he found no charge of the calibre\nindicated in the \xe2\x80\x9cManual,\xe2\x80\x9d nor describe his feelings at seeing two of\nhis soldiers fall, hit before his eyes, nor how he himself, even,\nescaped death twenty times by a hair\xe2\x80\x99s-breadth. Happily for him, the\ncaptain of the mortar, who had been given him for an assistant, a tall\nsailor attached to these mortars since the beginning of the siege,\nassured him that they could make use of them still, and promised him\nwhile he was walking on the bastion, lantern in hand, as calmly as if he\nwere in his kitchen-garden, to put them in good condition before\nmorning.\n\nThe bomb-proof reduct into which his guide conducted him was only a\ngreat, long cavern dug in the rocky earth, two fathoms deep, protected\nby oaken timbers eighteen inches thick. There he established himself\nwith his soldiers.\n\nAs soon as Vlang noticed the little low door which led into it, he threw\nhimself in the first with such haste that he nearly fell on the\nstone-paved floor, cowered down in a corner, and did not care to come\nout of it. The soldiers placed themselves on the ground along the wall.\nSome of them lighted their pipes, and Volodia arranged his bed in a\ncorner, stretched himself on it, lighted a candle in his turn, and\nsmoked a cigarette. Over their heads could be heard, deadened by the\nbomb-proof, the uninterrupted roar of the discharges. A single cannon\nclose beside them shook their shelter every time it thundered. In the\ninterior everything was quiet. The soldiers, still intimidated by the\npresence of the new officer, only exchanged a word with each other now\nand then to ask for a light or a little room. A rat was scratching\nsomewhere among the stones, and Vlang, who had not yet recovered from\nhis emotion, occasionally sighed deeply as he looked about him. Volodia,\non his bed in this peaceful corner crammed with people, lighted by a\nsingle candle, gave himself up to the feeling of comfort which he had\noften had as a child when, playing hide-and-seek, he slipped into a\nwardrobe or under his mother\xe2\x80\x99s skirt, holding his breath, stretching his\nears, being very much afraid of the dark, and feeling at the same time\nan unconscious impression of well-being.\n\nIn the same way here, without being altogether at his ease, he felt\nrather disposed to be cheerful.\n\n\nXXI.\n\nAt the end of ten minutes the soldiers got bold and began to talk. Near\nthe officer\xe2\x80\x99s bed, in the circle of light, were placed the highest in\nrank--the two artificers, one an old gray-haired man, his breast adorned\nwith a mass of medals and crosses, among which the cross of Saint George\nwas wanting, however, the other a young man, smoking cigarettes which he\nwas rolling, and the drummer, who placed himself, as is the custom, at\nthe orders of the officer, in the background. In the shadow of the\nentrance, behind the bombardier and the medalled soldiers seated in\nfront, the \xe2\x80\x9chumbles\xe2\x80\x9d kept themselves. They were the first to break\nsilence. One of them, running in frightened from outside, served as a\ntheme for their conversation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! say there, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t stay long in the street. Young girls are not\nplaying there, hey?\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary, they are singing wonderful songs. You don\xe2\x80\x99t hear such\nones in the village,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the new-comer, with a laugh, and all out\nof breath.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVassina doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like the shells; no, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like them!\xe2\x80\x9d some one\ncried from the aristocratic side.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen it is necessary it is another story,\xe2\x80\x9d slowly replied Vassina, whom\neverybody listened to when he spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cThe twenty-fourth, for example,\nthey fired so that it was a blessing, and there is no harm in that. Why\nlet us be killed for nothing? Do the chiefs thank us for that?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThese words provoked a general laugh.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless, there is Melnikoff, who is outside all the time,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nsome one.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true. Make him come in,\xe2\x80\x9d added the old artificer, \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise he\nwill get killed for nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is this Melnikoff?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Volodia.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is, your Excellency, an animal who is afraid of nothing. He is\nwalking about outside. Please examine him; he looks like a bear.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe practises witchcraft,\xe2\x80\x9d added Vassina, in his calm voice.\n\nMelnikoff, a very corpulent soldier (a rare thing), with red hair, a\ntremendously bulging forehead, and light blue projecting eyes, came in\njust at this moment.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you afraid of bomb-shells?\xe2\x80\x9d Volodia asked him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I be afraid of them?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Melnikoff, scratching his\nneck. \xe2\x80\x9cNo bomb-shell will kill me, I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you like to live here?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure I do; it is very entertaining,\xe2\x80\x9d and he burst out laughing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you must be sent out in a sortie. Would you like to? I will speak\nto the general,\xe2\x80\x9d said Volodia, although he knew no general.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not like to? I should like to very much!\xe2\x80\x9d and Melnikoff disappeared\nbehind his comrades.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, children, let\xe2\x80\x99s play \xe2\x80\x98beggar my neighbor!\xe2\x80\x99 Who has cards?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\nan impatient voice, and the game immediately began in the farthest\ncorner. The calling of the tricks could be heard, the sound of taps on\nthe nose and the bursts of laughter. Volodia in the mean time drank tea\nprepared by the drummer, offering some to the artificers, joking and\nchatting with them, desirous of making himself popular, and very well\nsatisfied with the respect they showed him. The soldiers having noticed\nthat the \xe2\x80\x9cbarine\xe2\x80\x9d was a good fellow, became animated, and one of them\nannounced that the siege was soon going to come to an end, for a sailor\nhad told him for a certainty that Constantine, the Czar\xe2\x80\x99s brother, was\ncoming to deliver them with the \xe2\x80\x98merican\xe2\x80\x99[H] fleet; that there would\nsoon be an armistice of two weeks to rest, and that seventy-five kopeks\nwould have to be paid for every shot that was fired during the truce.\n\nVassina, whom Volodia had already noticed--the short soldier with fine\ngreat eyes and side-whiskers--related in his turn, in the midst of a\ngeneral silence, which was next broken by bursts of laughter, the joy\nthat had been felt at first on seeing him come back to his village on\nhis furlough, and how his father had then sent him to work in the fields\nevery day, while the lieutenant-forester sent to fetch his wife in a\ncarriage. Volodia was amused by all these tales. He had no longer the\nleast fear, and the strong odors which filled their reduct did not cause\nhim any disgust. He felt, on the contrary, very gay, and in a very\nagreeable mood.\n\nSeveral soldiers were snoring already. Vlang was also lying on the\nground, and the old artificer, having spread his overcoat on the earth,\ncrossed himself with devotion and mumbled the evening prayer, when\nVolodia took a fancy to go and see what was going on out of doors.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPull in your legs!\xe2\x80\x9d the soldiers immediately said to one another as\nthey saw him get up, and each one drew his legs back to let him pass.\n\nVlang, who was supposed to be asleep, got up and seized Volodia by the\nlapel of his coat. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, don\xe2\x80\x99t go! what is the use?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a\ntearful and persuasive voice. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is. Bullets are\nraining out there. We are better off here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut Volodia went out without heeding him, and sat down on the very\nthreshold of their quarters by the side of Melnikoff.\n\nThe air was fresh and pure, especially after that he had just been\nbreathing, and the night was clear and calm. Through the roar of the\ncannonade could be heard the creak of the wheels of the carts bringing\ngabions, and the voices of those working in the magazine. Over their\nheads sparkled the starry sky, striped by the luminous furrows of the\nprojectiles. On the left was a small opening, two feet and a half high,\nleading to a bomb-proof shelter, where could be perceived the feet and\nthe backs of the sailors who lived there, and who were plainly heard\ntalking. Opposite rose the mound which covered the magazine, in front of\nwhich figures, bent double, passed and repassed. On the very top of the\neminence, exposed to bullets and shells which did not stop whistling at\nthat spot, was a tall black figure, with his hands in his pockets,\ntrampling on the fresh earth which was brought in bags. From time to\ntime a shell fell and burst two paces from him. The soldiers who were\ncarrying sacks bent down and separated, while the black silhouette\ncontinued quietly to level the earth with his feet without changing his\nposition.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is it?\xe2\x80\x9d Volodia asked Melnikoff.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know; I am going to see.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go; it is no use.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut Melnikoff rose without listening to him, went up to the black man,\nand remained immovable a long time beside him with the same indifference\nto danger.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the guardian of the magazine, your Excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, on his\nreturn. \xe2\x80\x9cA shell made a hole in it, and they are covering it up with\nearth.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen the shells seemed to fly straight upon the bomb-proof quarters\nVolodia squeezed himself into the corner, and then came out raising his\neyes to the sky to see if others were coming. Although Vlang, still\nlying down, had more than once begged him to come in, Volodia passed\nthree hours seated on the threshold, finding a certain pleasure in thus\nexposing himself, as well as in watching the flight of the projectiles.\nTowards the end of the evening he knew perfectly well the number of the\ncannon and the direction they fired, and where their shots struck.\n\n\nXXII.\n\nThe next day--the 27th of August--after ten hours of sleep, Volodia came\nout of the bomb-proof fresh and well. Vlang followed him, but at the\nfirst hissing of a cannon-ball he bounded back and threw himself through\nthe narrow opening, knocking his head as he went, to the general laugh\nof the soldiers, all of whom, with the exception of Vlang, of the old\nartificer, and two or three others who rarely showed themselves in the\ntrenches, had slipped outside to breathe the fresh morning air. In spite\nof the violence of the bombardment, they could not be prevented from\nremaining there, some near the entrance, others sheltered by the\nparapet. As to Melnikoff, he had been going and coming between the\nbatteries since daybreak, looking in the air with indifference.\n\nOn the very threshold of the quarters were seated three soldiers, two\nold and one young one. The latter, a curly-headed Jewish infantryman\nattached to the battery, picked up a bullet which rolled at his feet,\nand flattening it against a stone with a piece of a shell, he cut out of\nit a cross on the model of that of Saint George, while the others\nchatted, watching his work with interest, for he succeeded well with\nit.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say that if we stay here some time yet, when peace comes we shall be\nretired.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure enough. I have only four years more to serve, and I have been here\nsix months!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t count for retirement,\xe2\x80\x9d said another, at the moment when a\ncannon-ball whizzing over the group struck the earth a yard away from\nMelnikoff, who was coming towards them in the trench.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt almost killed Melnikoff!\xe2\x80\x9d cried a soldier.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt won\xe2\x80\x99t kill me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the former.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, take this cross for your bravery,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young Jewish soldier,\nfinishing the cross and giving it to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, brother, here the months count for years without exception. There\nwas an order about it,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the talker.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever happens, there will surely be, on the conclusion of peace, a\nreview by the Emperor at Warsaw, and if we are not retired we shall have\nan unlimited furlough.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJust at this instant a small cannon-ball passing over their heads with a\nricochet, seemed to moan and whistle together and fell on a stone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAttention!\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the soldiers. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps between now and night\nyou will get your definite furlough!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEverybody began to laugh. Two hours had not passed, evening had not yet\ncome, before two of them had, in effect, received their \xe2\x80\x9cdefinite\nfurlough,\xe2\x80\x9d and five had been wounded, but the rest continued to joke as\nbefore.\n\nIn the morning the two mortars had been put in order, and Volodia\nreceived at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock the order from the commander of the bastion to\nassemble his men and go with them upon the battery. Once at work, there\nremained no trace of that terror which the evening before showed itself\nso plainly. Vlang alone did not succeed in overcoming it; he hid\nhimself, and bent down every instant. Vassina had also lost his\ncoolness, he was excited and _saluted_. As to Volodia, stirred by an\nenthusiastic satisfaction, he thought no more of the danger. The joy he\nfelt at doing his duty well, at being no longer a coward, at feeling\nhimself, on the contrary, full of courage, the feeling of commanding and\nthe presence of twenty men, who he knew were watching him with\ncuriosity, had made a real hero of him. Being even a little vain of his\nbravery, he got up on the _banquette_, unbuttoning his coat so as to be\nwell observed. The commander of the bastion, in going his rounds,\nalthough he had been accustomed during eight months to courage in all\nits forms, could not help admiring this fine-looking boy with animated\nface and eyes, his unbuttoned coat exposing a red shirt, which confined\na white and delicate neck, clapping his hands, and crying in a voice of\ncommand, \xe2\x80\x9cFirst! second!\xe2\x80\x9d and jumping gayly on the rampart to see where\nhis shell had fallen. At half-past eleven the firing stopped on both\nsides, and at noon precisely began the assault on the Malakoff mamelon,\nas well as upon the second, third, and fifth bastions.\n\n\nXXIII.\n\nOn this side of the bay, between Inkerman and the fortifications of the\nnorth, two sailors were standing, in the middle of the day, on Telegraph\nHeight. Near them an officer was looking at Sebastopol through a\nfield-glass, and another on horseback, accompanied by a Cossack, had\njust rejoined him near the great signal-pole.\n\nThe sun soared over the gulf, where the water, covered with ships at\nanchor, and with sail and row boats in motion, played merrily in its\nwarm and luminous rays. A light breeze, which scarcely shook the leaves\nof the stunted oak bushes that grew beside the signal-station, filled\nthe sails of the boats, and made the waves ripple softly. On the other\nside of the gulf Sebastopol was visible, unchanged, with its unfinished\nchurch, its column, its quay, the boulevard which cut the hill with a\ngreen band, the elegant library building, its little lakes of azure\nblue, with their forests of masts, its picturesque aqueducts, and, above\nall that, clouds of a bluish tint, formed by powder-smoke, lighted up\nfrom time to time by the red flame of the firing. It was the same proud\nand beautiful Sebastopol, with its festal air, surrounded on one side by\nthe yellow smoke-crowned hills, on the other by the sea, deep blue in\ncolor, and sparkling brilliantly in the sun. At the horizon, where the\nsmoke of a steamer traced a black line, white, narrow clouds were\nrising, precursors of a wind. Along the whole line of the\nfortifications, along the heights, especially on the left side, spurted\nout suddenly, torn by a visible flash, although it was broad daylight,\nplumes of thick white smoke, which, assuming various forms, extended,\nrose, and colored the sky with sombre tints. These jets of smoke came\nout on all sides--from the hills, from the hostile batteries, from the\ncity--and flew towards the sky. The noise of the explosions shook the\nair with a continuous roar. Towards noon these smoke-puffs became rarer\nand rarer, and the vibrations of the air strata became less frequent.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know that the second bastion is no longer replying?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\nhussar officer on horseback; \xe2\x80\x9cit is entirely demolished. It is\nterrible!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and the Malakoff replies twice out of three times,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the\none who was looking through the field-glass. \xe2\x80\x9cThis silence is driving me\nmad! They are firing straight on the Korniloff battery, and that is not\nreplying.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll see it will be as I said; towards noon they will cease firing.\nIt is always that way. Come and take breakfast, they are waiting for us.\nThere is nothing more to see here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait, don\xe2\x80\x99t bother me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied, with marked agitation, the one looking\nthrough the field-glass.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?--what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a movement in the trenches; they are marching in close\ncolumns.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I see it well,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the sailors; \xe2\x80\x9cthey are advancing by\ncolumns. We must set the signal.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut see, there--see! They are coming out of the trenches!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey could see, in fact, with the naked eye black spots going down from\nthe hill into the ravine, and proceeding from the French batteries\ntowards our bastions. In the foreground, in front of the former, black\nspots could be seen very near our lines. Suddenly, from different points\nof the bastion at the same time, spurted out the white plumes of the\ndischarges, and, thanks to the wind, the noise of a lively fusillade\ncould be heard, like the patter of a heavy rain against the windows. The\nblack lines advanced, wrapped in a curtain of smoke, and came nearer.\nThe fusillade increased in violence. The smoke burst out at shorter and\nshorter intervals, extended rapidly along the line in a single light,\nlilac-colored cloud, unrolling and enlarging itself by turns, furrowed\nhere and there by flashes or rent by black points. All the noises\nmingled together in the tumult of one continued roar.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is an assault,\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer, pale with emotion, handing his\nglass to the sailor.\n\nCossacks and officers on horseback went along the road, preceding the\ncommander-in-chief in his carriage, accompanied by his suite. Their\nfaces expressed the painful emotion of expectation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible that it is taken!\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer on horseback.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod in heaven!--the flag! Look now!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the other, choked by\nemotion, turning away from the glass. \xe2\x80\x9cThe French flag is in the\nMalakoff mamelon!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nXXIV.\n\nKoseltzoff the elder, who had had the time during the night to win and\nlose again all his winnings, including even the gold-pieces sewn in the\nseams of his uniform, was sleeping, towards morning, in the barracks of\nthe fifth bastion, a heavy but deep sleep, when the sinister cry rang\nout, repeated by different voices, \xe2\x80\x9cThe alarm!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWake up, Mikha\xc3\xafl Semenovitch! It is an assault!\xe2\x80\x9d a voice cried in his\near.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA school-boy trick,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, opening his eyes without believing the\nnews; but when he perceived an officer, pale, agitated, running wildly\nfrom one corner to another, he understood all, and the thought that he\nmight perhaps be taken for a coward refusing to join his company in a\ncritical moment, gave him such a violent start that he rushed out and\nran straight to find his soldiers. The cannon were dumb, but the\nmusket-firing was at its height, and the bullets were whistling, not\nsingly but in swarms, just as the flights of little birds pass over our\nheads in autumn. The whole of the place occupied by the battalion the\nevening before was filled with smoke, with cries, and with curses. On\nhis way he met a crowd of soldiers and wounded, and thirty paces farther\non he saw his company brought to a stand against a wall.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Swartz redoubt is occupied,\xe2\x80\x9d said a young officer. \xe2\x80\x9cAll is lost!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat stuff and nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d he angrily replied, and drawing his small\nrusty sword from its scabbard, shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cForward, children! Hurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHis strong and resounding voice stimulated his own courage, and he ran\nforward along the traverse. Fifty soldiers dashed after him with a\nshout. They came out on an open place, and a hail of bullets met them.\nTwo struck him simultaneously, but he did not have time to understand\nwhere they had hit him, or whether they had bruised or had wounded him,\nfor in the smoke before him blue uniforms and red trousers started up,\nand cries were heard which were not Russian. A Frenchman sitting on the\nrampart was waving his hat and shouting. The conviction that he would be\nkilled whetted Koseltzoff\xe2\x80\x99s courage. He continued to run forward; some\nsoldiers passed him, others appeared suddenly from another side and\nbegan to run with him. The distance between them and the blue uniforms,\nwho regained their intrenchments by running, remained the same, but his\nfeet stumbled over the dead and the wounded. Arrived at the outer ditch,\neverything became confused before his eyes, and he felt a violent pain\nin his chest. A half hour later he was lying on a stretcher near the\nNicholas barrack. He knew he was wounded, but he felt no pain. He would\nhave liked, nevertheless, to drink something cold, and to feel himself\nlying more comfortably.\n\nA stout little doctor with black whiskers came up to him and unbuttoned\nhis overcoat. Koseltzoff looked over his chin at the face of the doctor,\nwho was examining his wound without causing him the least pain. He,\nhaving covered the wounded man again with his shirt, wiped his fingers\non the lapels of his coat, and turning aside his head, passed to another\nin silence. Koseltzoff mechanically followed with his eyes all that was\ngoing on about him, and remembering the fifth bastion, congratulated\nhimself with great satisfaction. He had valiantly done his duty. It was\nthe first time since he was in the service that he had performed it in a\nway that he had nothing to reproach himself for. The surgeon, who had\njust dressed another officer\xe2\x80\x99s wound, pointed him out to a priest, who\nhad a fine large red beard, and who stood there with a cross.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I going to die?\xe2\x80\x9d Koseltzoff asked him, seeing him come near.\n\nThe priest made no reply, but recited a prayer and held the cross down\nto him. Death had no terror for Koseltzoff. Carrying the cross to his\nlips with weakening hands, he wept.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre the French driven back?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked the priest in a firm voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVictory is ours along the whole line,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the latter, hiding the\ntruth to spare the feelings of the dying man, for the French flag was\nalready flying on the Malakoff mamelon.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the wounded man, whose tears ran down his cheeks\nunnoticed. The memory of his brother passed through his mind for a\nsecond. \xe2\x80\x9cGod grant him the same happiness!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\nXXV.\n\nBut such was not Volodia\xe2\x80\x99s lot. While he was listening to a tale that\nVassina was relating, the alarm cry, \xe2\x80\x9cThe French are coming!\xe2\x80\x9d made his\nblood rush immediately back to his heart; he felt his cheeks pale and\nturn cold, and he remained a second stupefied. Then looking around, he\nsaw the soldiers button their coats and glide out one after the other,\nand he heard one of them, Melnikoff, probably, say, in a joking way,\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, children, let\xe2\x80\x99s offer him bread and salt.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nVolodia and Vlang, who did not leave his heels, went out together and\nran to the battery. On one side as well as on the other the artillery\nhad ceased firing. The despicable and cynical cowardice of the yunker\nstill more than the coolness of the soldiers had the effect of restoring\nhis courage.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I like him?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, rushing quickly towards the parapet, near\nwhich the mortars were placed. From there he distinctly saw the French\ndash across the space, free from every obstacle, and run straight\ntowards him. Their bayonets, sparkling in the sun, were moving in the\nnearest trenches. A small, square-shouldered Zouave ran ahead of the\nothers, sabre in hand, leaping over the ditches. \xe2\x80\x9cGrape!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted\nVolodia, throwing himself down from the parapet. But the soldiers had\nalready thought of it, and the metallic noise of the grape, thrown first\nby one mortar and then by the other, thundered over his head. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst!\nsecond!\xe2\x80\x9d he ordered, running across between the two mortars, completely\nforgetting the danger. Shouts and the musket reports of the battalion\ncharged with the defence of the battery were heard on one side, and\nsuddenly on the left arose a desperate clamor, repeated by many voices:\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are coming in our rear!\xe2\x80\x9d and Volodia, turning around, saw a score\nof Frenchmen. One of them, a fine man with a black beard, ran towards\nhim, and halting ten paces from the battery, fired at him point-blank\nand went on. Volodia, petrified, could not believe his eyes. In front of\nhim, on the rampart, were blue uniforms, and two Frenchmen who were\nspiking a cannon. With the exception of Melnikoff, killed by a bullet at\nhis side, and Vlang, who with downcast eyes, and face inflamed by fury,\nwas brandishing a hand-spike, no one was left.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFollow me, Vladimir Semenovitch! follow me!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Vlang, in a\ndespairing tone, defending himself with the lever from the French who\ncame behind him. The yunker\xe2\x80\x99s menacing look, and the blow which he\nstruck two of them, made them halt.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFollow me, Vladimir Semenovitch!--What are you waiting for? Fly!\xe2\x80\x9d and\nhe threw himself into the trench, from which our infantry were firing on\nthe enemy. He immediately came out of it, however, to see what had\nbecome of his beloved lieutenant. A shapeless thing, clothed in a gray\novercoat, lay, face to earth, on the spot where Volodia stood, and the\nwhole place was filled by the French, who were firing at our men.\n\n\nXXVI.\n\nVlang found his battery again in the second line of defence, and of the\ntwenty soldiers who recently composed it, only eight were alive.\n\nTowards nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening Vlang and his men were crossing the\nbay in a steamboat in the direction of Severna\xc3\xafa. The boat was laden\nwith wounded, with cannon, and with horses. The firing had stopped\neverywhere. The stars sparkled in the sky as on the night before, but a\nstrong wind was blowing and the sea was rough. On the first and second\nbastions flames flashed up close to the ground, preceding explosions\nwhich shook the atmosphere and showed stones and black objects of\nstrange form thrown into the air. Something near the docks was on fire,\nand a red flame was reflected in the water. The bridge, covered with\npeople, was lighted up by fires from the Nicholas battery. A great sheaf\nof flames seemed to rise over the water on the distant point of the\nAlexander battery, and lighted up the under side of a cloud of smoke\nwhich hovered over it. As on the preceding evening, the lights of the\nhostile fleet sparkled afar on the sea, calm and insolent. The masts of\nour scuttled vessels, slowly settling into the depths of the water,\ncontrasted sharply against the red glow of the fires. On the deck of the\nsteamboat no one spoke. Now and then, in the midst of the regular\nchopping of the waves struck by the wheels, and the hissing of escaping\nsteam, could be heard the snorting of horses, the striking of their\niron-shod hoofs on the planks, the captain speaking a few words of\ncommand, and also the dolorous groaning of the wounded. Vlang, who had\nnot eaten since the day before, drew a crust of bread from his pocket\nand gnawed it, but at the thought of Volodia he broke out sobbing so\nviolently that the soldiers were surprised at it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook! our Vlang is eating bread and weeping,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vassina.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrange!\xe2\x80\x9d added one of them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee! they have burned our barracks!\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, sighing. \xe2\x80\x9cHow many\nof our fellows are dead, and dead to no purpose, for the French have got\npossession!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have scarcely come out alive. We must thank God for it,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nVassina.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all the same. It is maddening!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Do you think they will lead a happy life there? Wait a bit; we\nwill take them back. We will still lose some of our men, possibly, but\nas true as God is holy, if the emperor orders it we will take them back!\nDo you think they have been left as they were? Come, come; these were\nonly naked walls. The intrenchments were blown up. He has planted his\nflag on the mamelon, it is true, but he won\xe2\x80\x99t risk himself in the town.\nWait a bit; we won\xe2\x80\x99t be behindhand with you! Only give us time,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid, looking in the direction of the French.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be so, that\xe2\x80\x99s sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said another, with conviction.\n\nOn the whole line of the bastions of Sebastopol, where during whole\nmonths an ardent and energetic life was stirring, where during months\ndeath alone relieved the agony of the heroes, one after the other, who\ninspired the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s terror, hatred, and finally admiration--on these\nbastions, I say, there was not a single soul, everything there was dead,\nfierce, frightful, but not silent, for everything all around was falling\nin with a din. On the earth, torn up by a recent explosion, were lying,\nhere and there, broken beams, crushed bodies of Russians and French,\nheavy cast-iron cannon overturned into the ditch by a terrible force,\nhalf buried in the ground and forever dumb, bomb-shells, balls,\nsplinters of beams, ditches, bomb-proofs, and more corpses, in blue or\nin gray overcoats, which seemed to have been shaken by supreme\nconvulsions, and which were lighted up now every instant by the red fire\nof the explosions which resounded in the air.\n\nThe enemy well saw that something unusual was going on in formidable\nSebastopol, and the explosions, the silence of death on the bastions,\nmade them tremble. Under the impression of the calm and firm resistance\nof the last day they did not yet dare believe in the disappearance of\ntheir invincible adversary, and they awaited, silent and motionless,\nthe end of the dismal night.\n\nThe army of Sebastopol, like a sea whose liquid mass, agitated and\nuneasy, spreads and overflows, moved slowly forward in the dark night,\nundulating into the impenetrable gloom, over the bridge on the bay,\nproceeding towards Severna\xc3\xafa, leaving behind them those spots where so\nmany heroes had fallen, sprinkling them with their blood, those places\ndefended during eleven months against an enemy twice as strong as\nitself, and which it had received the order this very day to abandon\nwithout a fight.\n\nThe first impression caused by this order of the day weighed heavily on\nthe heart of every Russian; next the fear of pursuit was the dominant\nfeeling with all. The soldiers, accustomed to fight in the places they\nwere abandoning, felt themselves without defence the moment they left\nthose behind. Uneasy, they crowded together in masses at the entrance of\nthe bridge, which was lifted by violent wind gusts. Through the\nobstruction of regiments, of militiamen, of wagons, some crowding the\nothers, the infantry, whose muskets clashed together, and the officers\ncarrying orders, made a passage for themselves with difficulty. The\ninhabitants and the military servants accompanying the baggage begged\nand wept to be permitted to cross, while the artillery, in a hurry to go\naway, rolled along noisily, coming down towards the bay. Although the\nattention was distracted by a thousand details, the feeling of\nself-preservation, and the desire to fly as soon as possible from that\nfatal spot, filled each one\xe2\x80\x99s soul. It was thus with the mortally\nwounded soldier lying among five hundred other unfortunates on the\nflag-stones of the Paul quay, begging God for death; with the exhausted\nmilitiaman, who by a last effort forces his way into the compact crowd\nto leave a free passage for a superior officer; with the general who is\ncommanding the passage with a firm voice, and restraining the impatient\nsoldiers; with the straggling sailor or the battalion on the march,\nalmost stifled by the moving crowd; with the wounded officer borne by\nfour soldiers, who, stopped by the crowd, lay down the stretcher near\nthe Nicholas barracks; with the old artilleryman, who, during sixteen\nyears, has not left the cannon which, with the assistance of his\ncomrades and at the command of his chief, incomprehensible for him, he\nis about to tumble over into the bay; and, at length, with the sailors\nwho have just scuttled their ships, and are vigorously rowing away in\ntheir boats.\n\nArrived at the end of the bridge, each soldier, with very few\nexceptions, takes off his cap and crosses himself. But besides this\nfeeling he has another, more poignant, deeper--a feeling akin to\nrepentance, to shame, to hatred; for it is with an inexpressible\nbitterness of heart that each of them sighs, utters threats against the\nenemy, and, as he reaches the north side, throws a last look upon\nabandoned Sebastopol.\n\n\nFINIS.\n\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[A] The Military Gazette.--TRANS.\n\n[B] A sort of arbor covered with ivy was then used in most fashionable\nparlors.--TRANS.\n\n[C] A cadet.
