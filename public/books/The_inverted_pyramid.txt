The majority of them\nwere retranslations from the French, and I found that the respective\ntransitions through which they had passed tended to obliterate many of\nthe beauties of the Russian language and of the peculiar\ncharacteristics of Russian life. A satisfactory translation can be made\nonly by one who understands the language and _spirit_ of the Russian\npeople. As Tolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s writings contain so many idioms it is not an easy\ntask to render them into intelligible English, and the one who\nsuccessfully accomplishes this must be a native of Russia, commanding\nthe English and Russian languages with equal fluency.\n\nThe story of \xe2\x80\x9cIvan the Fool\xe2\x80\x9d portrays Tolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s communistic ideas,\ninvolving the abolition of military forces, middlemen, despotism, and\nmoney. Instead of these he would establish on earth a kingdom in which\neach and every person would become a worker and producer. The author\ndescribes the various struggles through which three brothers passed,\nbeset as they were by devils large and small, until they reached the\nideal state of existence which he believes to be the only happy one\nattainable in this world.\n\nOn reading this little story one is surprised that the Russian censor\npassed it, as it is devoted to a narration of ideas quite at variance\nwith the present policy of the government of that country.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Lost Opportunity\xe2\x80\x9d is a singularly true picture of peasant life,\nwhich evinces a deep study of the subject on the part of the writer.\nTolstoy has drawn many of the peculiar customs of the Russian peasant\nin a masterly manner, and I doubt if he has given a more comprehensive\ndescription of this feature of Russian life in any of his other works.\nIn this story also he has presented many traits which are common to\nhuman nature throughout the world, and this gives an added interest to\nthe book. The language is simple and picturesque, and the characters\nare drawn with remarkable fidelity to nature. The moral of this tale\npoints out how the hero Ivan might have avoided the terrible\nconsequences of a quarrel with his neighbor (which grew out of nothing)\nif he had lived in accordance with the scriptural injunction to forgive\nhis brother\xe2\x80\x99s sins and seek not for revenge.\n\nThe story of \xe2\x80\x9cPolikushka\xe2\x80\x9d is a very graphic description of the life led\nby a servant of the court household of a certain nobleman, in which the\nauthor portrays the different conditions and surroundings enjoyed by\nthese servants from those of the ordinary or common peasants. It is a\ntrue and powerful reproduction of an element in Russian life but little\nwritten about heretofore. Like the other stories of this great writer,\n\xe2\x80\x9cPolikushka\xe2\x80\x9d has a moral to which we all might profitably give heed. He\nillustrates the awful consequences of intemperance, and concludes that\nonly kind treatment can reform the victims of alcohol.\n\nFor much valuable assistance in the work of these translations, I am\ndeeply indebted to the bright English scholarship of my devoted wife.\n\n\n\n\nTHE KREUTZER SONATA.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\nTravellers left and entered our car at every stopping of the train.\nThree persons, however, remained, bound, like myself, for the farthest\nstation: a lady neither young nor pretty, smoking cigarettes, with a\nthin face, a cap on her head, and wearing a semi-masculine outer\ngarment; then her companion, a very loquacious gentleman of about forty\nyears, with baggage entirely new and arranged in an orderly manner;\nthen a gentleman who held himself entirely aloof, short in stature,\nvery nervous, of uncertain age, with bright eyes, not pronounced in\ncolor, but extremely attractive,\xe2\x80\x94eyes that darted with rapidity from\none object to another.\n\nThis gentleman, during almost all the journey thus far, had entered\ninto conversation with no fellow-traveller, as if he carefully avoided\nall acquaintance. When spoken to, he answered curtly and decisively,\nand began to look out of the car window obstinately.\n\nYet it seemed to me that the solitude weighed upon him. He seemed to\nperceive that I understood this, and when our eyes met, as happened\nfrequently, since we were sitting almost opposite each other, he turned\naway his head, and avoided conversation with me as much as with the\nothers. At nightfall, during a stop at a large station, the gentleman\nwith the fine baggage\xe2\x80\x94a lawyer, as I have since learned\xe2\x80\x94got out with\nhis companion to drink some tea at the restaurant. During their absence\nseveral new travellers entered the car, among whom was a tall old man,\nshaven and wrinkled, evidently a merchant, wearing a large\nheavily-lined cloak and a big cap. This merchant sat down opposite the\nempty seats of the lawyer and his companion, and straightway entered\ninto conversation with a young man who seemed like an employee in some\ncommercial house, and who had likewise just boarded the train. At first\nthe clerk had remarked that the seat opposite was occupied, and the old\nman had answered that he should get out at the first station. Thus\ntheir conversation started.\n\nI was sitting not far from these two travellers, and, as the train was\nnot in motion, I could catch bits of their conversation when others\nwere not talking.\n\nThey talked first of the prices of goods and the condition of business;\nthey referred to a person whom they both knew; then they plunged into\nthe fair at Nijni Novgorod. The clerk boasted of knowing people who\nwere leading a gay life there, but the old man did not allow him to\ncontinue, and, interrupting him, began to describe the festivities of\nthe previous year at Kounavino, in which he had taken part. He was\nevidently proud of these recollections, and, probably thinking that\nthis would detract nothing from the gravity which his face and manners\nexpressed, he related with pride how, when drunk, he had fired, at\nKounavino, such a broadside that he could describe it only in the\nother\xe2\x80\x99s ear.\n\nThe clerk began to laugh noisily. The old man laughed too, showing two\nlong yellow teeth. Their conversation not interesting me, I left the\ncar to stretch my legs. At the door I met the lawyer and his lady.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no more time,\xe2\x80\x9d the lawyer said to me. \xe2\x80\x9cThe second bell is\nabout to ring.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIndeed I had scarcely reached the rear of the train when the bell\nsounded. As I entered the car again, the lawyer was talking with his\ncompanion in an animated fashion. The merchant, sitting opposite them,\nwas taciturn.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then she squarely declared to her husband,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer with a\nsmile, as I passed by them, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she neither could nor would live with\nhim, because\xe2\x80\x9d . . .\n\nAnd he continued, but I did not hear the rest of the sentence, my\nattention being distracted by the passing of the conductor and a new\ntraveller. When silence was restored, I again heard the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\nThe conversation had passed from a special case to general\nconsiderations.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd afterward comes discord, financial difficulties, disputes between\nthe two parties, and the couple separate. In the good old days that\nseldom happened. Is it not so?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the lawyer of the two merchants,\nevidently trying to drag them into the conversation.\n\nJust then the train started, and the old man, without answering, took\noff his cap, and crossed himself three times while muttering a prayer.\nWhen he had finished, he clapped his cap far down on his head, and\nsaid:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, that happened in former times also, but not as often. In the\npresent day it is bound to happen more frequently. People have become\ntoo learned.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe lawyer made some reply to the old man, but the train, ever\nincreasing its speed, made such a clatter upon the rails that I could\nno longer hear distinctly. As I was interested in what the old man was\nsaying, I drew nearer. My neighbor, the nervous gentleman, was\nevidently interested also, and, without changing his seat, he lent an\near.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what harm is there in education?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the lady, with a smile\nthat was scarcely perceptible. \xe2\x80\x9cWould it be better to marry as in the\nold days, when the bride and bridegroom did not even see each other\nbefore marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, answering, as is the habit of our\nladies, not the words that her interlocutor had spoken, but the words\nshe believed he was going to speak. \xe2\x80\x9cWomen did not know whether they\nwould love or would be loved, and they were married to the first comer,\nand suffered all their lives. Then you think it was better so?\xe2\x80\x9d she\ncontinued, evidently addressing the lawyer and myself, and not at all\nthe old man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople have become too learned,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the last, looking at the\nlady with contempt, and leaving her question unanswered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be curious to know how you explain the correlation between\neducation and conjugal differences,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer, with a slight\nsmile.\n\nThe merchant wanted to make some reply, but the lady interrupted him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, those days are past.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe lawyer cut short her words:\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him express his thought.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause there is no more fear,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how will you marry people who do not love each other? Only animals\ncan be coupled at the will of a proprietor. But people have\ninclinations, attachments,\xe2\x80\x9d the lady hastened to say, casting a glance\nat the lawyer, at me, and even at the clerk, who, standing up and\nleaning his elbow on the back of a seat, was listening to the\nconversation with a smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are wrong to say that, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cThe animals are\nbeasts, but man has received the law.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, nevertheless, how is one to live with a man when there is no\nlove?\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, evidently excited by the general sympathy and\nattention.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFormerly no such distinctions were made,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, gravely.\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly now have they become a part of our habits. As soon as the least\nthing happens, the wife says: \xe2\x80\x98I release you. I am going to leave your\nhouse.\xe2\x80\x99 Even among the moujiks this fashion has become acclimated.\n\xe2\x80\x98There,\xe2\x80\x99 she says, \xe2\x80\x98here are your shirts and drawers. I am going off\nwith Vanka. His hair is curlier than yours.\xe2\x80\x99 Just go talk with them.\nAnd yet the first rule for the wife should be fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe clerk looked at the lawyer, the lady, and myself, evidently\nrepressing a smile, and all ready to deride or approve the merchant\xe2\x80\x99s\nwords, according to the attitude of the others.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat fear?\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis fear,\xe2\x80\x94the wife must fear her husband; that is what fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that, my little father, that is ended.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, madam, that cannot end. As she, Eve, the woman, was taken from\nman\xe2\x80\x99s ribs, so she will remain unto the end of the world,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old\nman, shaking his head so triumphantly and so severely that the clerk,\ndeciding that the victory was on his side, burst into a loud laugh.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you men think so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the lady, without surrendering, and\nturning toward us. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have given yourself liberty. As for woman, you\nwish to keep her in the seraglio. To you, everything is permissible. Is\nit not so?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, man,\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s another affair.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, according to you, to man everything is permissible?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one gives him this permission; only, if the man behaves badly\noutside, the family is not increased thereby; but the woman, the wife,\nis a fragile vessel,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the merchant, severely.\n\nHis tone of authority evidently subjugated his hearers. Even the lady\nfelt crushed, but she did not surrender.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but you will admit, I think, that woman is a human being, and has\nfeelings like her husband. What should she do if she does not love her\nhusband?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she does not love him!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the old man, stormily, and\nknitting his brows; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy, she will be made to love him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis unexpected argument pleased the clerk, and he uttered a murmur of\napprobation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, she will not be forced,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere there is no\nlove, one cannot be obliged to love in spite of herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if the wife deceives her husband, what is to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\nlawyer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat should not happen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cHe must have his eyes\nabout him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if it does happen, all the same? You will admit that it does\nhappen?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt happens among the upper classes, not among us,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the old\nman. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if any husband is found who is such a fool as not to rule his\nwife, he will not have robbed her. But no scandal, nevertheless. Love\nor not, but do not disturb the household. Every husband can govern his\nwife. He has the necessary power. It is only the imbecile who does not\nsucceed in doing so.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEverybody was silent. The clerk moved, advanced, and, not wishing to\nlag behind the others in the conversation, began with his eternal\nsmile:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, in the house of our employer, a scandal has arisen, and it is\nvery difficult to view the matter clearly. The wife loved to amuse\nherself, and began to go astray. He is a capable and serious man.\nFirst, it was with the book-keeper. The husband tried to bring her back\nto reason through kindness. She did not change her conduct. She plunged\ninto all sorts of beastliness. She began to steal his money. He beat\nher, but she grew worse and worse. To an unbaptized, to a pagan, to a\nJew (saving your permission), she went in succession for her caresses.\nWhat could the employer do? He has dropped her entirely, and now he\nlives as a bachelor. As for her, she is dragging in the depths.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is an imbecile,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cIf from the first he had not\nallowed her to go in her own fashion, and had kept a firm hand upon\nher, she would be living honestly, no danger. Liberty must be taken\naway from the beginning. Do not trust yourself to your horse upon the\nhighway. Do not trust yourself to your wife at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt that moment the conductor passed, asking for the tickets for the\nnext station. The old man gave up his.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the feminine sex must be dominated in season, else all will\nperish.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you yourselves, at Kounavino, did you not lead a gay life with the\npretty girls?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the lawyer with a smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s another matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said the merchant, severely. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-by,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nadded, rising. He wrapped himself in his cloak, lifted his cap, and,\ntaking his bag, left the car.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nScarcely had the old man gone when a general conversation began.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a little Old Testament father for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the clerk.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a Domostroy,\xe2\x80\x9d[*] said the lady. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat savage ideas about a woman\nand marriage!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n[*] The Domostroy is a matrimonial code of the days of Ivan the\nTerrible.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are still a long way from the\nEuropean ideas upon marriage. First, the rights of woman, then free\nmarriage, then divorce, as a question not yet solved.\xe2\x80\x9d . . .\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe main thing, and the thing which such people as he do not\nunderstand,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the lady, \xe2\x80\x9cis that only love consecrates\nmarriage, and that the real marriage is that which is consecrated by\nlove.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe clerk listened and smiled, with the air of one accustomed to store\nin his memory all intelligent conversation that he hears, in order to\nmake use of it afterwards.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what is this love that consecrates marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d said, suddenly, the\nvoice of the nervous and taciturn gentleman, who, unnoticed by us, had\napproached.\n\nHe was standing with his hand on the seat, and evidently agitated. His\nface was red, a vein in his forehead was swollen, and the muscles of\nhis cheeks quivered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this love that consecrates marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat love?\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady. \xe2\x80\x9cThe ordinary love of husband and wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how, then, can ordinary love consecrate marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d continued the\nnervous gentleman, still excited, and with a displeased air. He seemed\nto wish to say something disagreeable to the lady. She felt it, and\nbegan to grow agitated.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow? Why, very simply,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\n\nThe nervous gentleman seized the word as it left her lips.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not simply.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam says,\xe2\x80\x9d interceded the lawyer indicating his companion, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\nmarriage should be first the result of an attachment, of a love, if you\nwill, and that, when love exists, and in that case only, marriage\nrepresents something sacred. But every marriage which is not based on a\nnatural attachment, on love, has in it nothing that is morally\nobligatory. Is not that the idea that you intended to convey?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked\nthe lady.\n\nThe lady, with a nod of her head, expressed her approval of this\ntranslation of her thoughts.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the lawyer, continuing his remarks.\n\nBut the nervous gentleman, evidently scarcely able to contain himself,\nwithout allowing the lawyer to finish, asked:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir. But what are we to understand by this love that alone\nconsecrates marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody knows what love is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, and I should like to know how you define it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow? It is very simple,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady.\n\nAnd she seemed thoughtful, and then said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove . . . love . . . is a preference for one man or one woman to the\nexclusion of all others. . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA preference for how long? . . . For a month, two days, or half an\nhour?\xe2\x80\x9d said the nervous gentleman, with special irritation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, permit me, you evidently are not talking of the same thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am talking absolutely of the same thing. Of the preference for\none man or one woman to the exclusion of all others. But I ask: a\npreference for how long?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor how long? For a long time, for a life-time sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that happens only in novels. In life, never. In life this\npreference for one to the exclusion of all others lasts in rare cases\nseveral years, oftener several months, or even weeks, days, hours. . .\n.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sir. Oh, no, no, permit me,\xe2\x80\x9d said all three of us at the same\ntime.\n\nThe clerk himself uttered a monosyllable of disapproval.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, shouting louder than all of us; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are\ntalking of what is believed to exist, and I am talking of what is.\nEvery man feels what you call love toward each pretty woman he sees,\nand very little toward his wife. That is the origin of the proverb,\xe2\x80\x94and\nit is a true one,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Another\xe2\x80\x99s wife is a white swan, and ours is bitter\nwormwood.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but what you say is terrible! There certainly exists among human\nbeings this feeling which is called love, and which lasts, not for\nmonths and years, but for life.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that does not exist. Even if it should be admitted that Menelaus\nhad preferred Helen all his life, Helen would have preferred Paris; and\nso it has been, is, and will be eternally. And it cannot be otherwise,\njust as it cannot happen that, in a load of chick-peas, two peas marked\nwith a special sign should fall side by side. Further, this is not only\nan improbability, but it is certain that a feeling of satiety will come\nto Helen or to Menelaus. The whole difference is that to one it comes\nsooner, to the other later. It is only in stupid novels that it is\nwritten that \xe2\x80\x98they loved each other all their lives.\xe2\x80\x99 And none but\nchildren can believe it. To talk of loving a man or woman for life is\nlike saying that a candle can burn forever.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are talking of physical love. Do you not admit a love based\nupon a conformity of ideals, on a spiritual affinity?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? But in that case it is not necessary to procreate together\n(excuse my brutality). The point is that this conformity of ideals is\nnot met among old people, but among young and pretty persons,\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\nand he began to laugh disagreeably.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I affirm that love, real love, does not consecrate marriage, as\nwe are in the habit of believing, but that, on the contrary, it ruins\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPermit me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer. \xe2\x80\x9cThe facts contradict your words. We see\nthat marriage exists, that all humanity\xe2\x80\x94at least the larger\nportion\xe2\x80\x94lives conjugally, and that many husbands and wives honestly end\na long life together.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe nervous gentleman smiled ill-naturedly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what then? You say that marriage is based upon love, and when I\ngive voice to a doubt as to the existence of any other love than\nsensual love, you prove to me the existence of love by marriage. But in\nour day marriage is only a violence and falsehood.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, pardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer. \xe2\x80\x9cI say only that marriages have\nexisted and do exist.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how and why do they exist? They have existed, and they do exist,\nfor people who have seen, and do see, in marriage something\nsacramental, a sacrament that is binding before God. For such people\nmarriages exist, but to us they are only hypocrisy and violence. We\nfeel it, and, to clear ourselves, we preach free love; but, really, to\npreach free love is only a call backward to the promiscuity of the\nsexes (excuse me, he said to the lady), the haphazard sin of certain\n_raskolniks_. The old foundation is shattered; we must build a new one,\nbut we must not preach debauchery.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe grew so warm that all became silent, looking at him in astonishment.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet the transition state is terrible. People feel that haphazard\nsin is inadmissible. It is necessary in some way or other to regulate\nthe sexual relations; but there exists no other foundation than the old\none, in which nobody longer believes? People marry in the old fashion,\nwithout believing in what they do, and the result is falsehood,\nviolence. When it is falsehood alone, it is easily endured. The husband\nand wife simply deceive the world by professing to live monogamically.\nIf they really are polygamous and polyandrous, it is bad, but\nacceptable. But when, as often happens, the husband and the wife have\ntaken upon themselves the obligation to live together all their lives\n(they themselves do not know why), and from the second month have\nalready a desire to separate, but continue to live together just the\nsame, then comes that infernal existence in which they resort to drink,\nin which they fire revolvers, in which they assassinate each other, in\nwhich they poison each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAll were silent, but we felt ill at ease.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, these critical episodes happen in marital life. For instance,\nthere is the Posdnicheff affair,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer, wishing to stop the\nconversation on this embarrassing and too exciting ground. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you\nread how he killed his wife through jealousy?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe lady said that she had not read it. The nervous gentleman said\nnothing, and changed color.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see that you have divined who I am,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, suddenly, after a\npause.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have not had that pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no great pleasure. I am Posdnicheff.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNew silence. He blushed, then turned pale again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat matters it, however?\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, I do not wish to\nembarrass you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd he resumed his old seat.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nI resumed mine, also. The lawyer and the lady whispered together. I was\nsitting beside Posdnicheff, and I maintained silence. I desired to talk\nto him, but I did not know how to begin, and thus an hour passed until\nwe reached the next station.\n\nThere the lawyer and the lady went out, as well as the clerk. We were\nleft alone, Posdnicheff and I.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say it, and they lie, or they do not understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nPosdnicheff.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf what are you talking?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, still the same thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe leaned his elbows upon his knees, and pressed his hands against his\ntemples.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove, marriage, family,\xe2\x80\x94all lies, lies, lies.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe rose, lowered the lamp-shade, lay down with his elbows on the\ncushion, and closed his eyes. He remained thus for a minute.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it disagreeable to you to remain with me, now that you know who I\nam?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no desire to sleep?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen do you want me to tell you the story of my life?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJust then the conductor passed. He followed him with an ill-natured\nlook, and did not begin until he had gone again. Then during all the\nrest of the story he did not stop once. Even the new travellers as they\nentered did not stop him.\n\nHis face, while he was talking, changed several times so completely\nthat it bore positively no resemblance to itself as it had appeared\njust before. His eyes, his mouth, his moustache, and even his beard,\nall were new. Each time it was a beautiful and touching physiognomy,\nand these transformations were produced suddenly in the penumbra; and\nfor five minutes it was the same face, that could not be compared to\nthat of five minutes before. And then, I know not how, it changed\nagain, and became unrecognizable.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I am going then to tell you my life, and my whole frightful\nhistory,\xe2\x80\x94yes, frightful. And the story itself is more frightful than\nthe outcome.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe became silent for a moment, passed his hands over his eyes, and\nbegan:\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be understood clearly, the whole must be told from the beginning.\nIt must be told how and why I married, and what I was before my\nmarriage. First, I will tell you who I am. The son of a rich gentleman\nof the steppes, an old marshal of the nobility, I was a University\npupil, a graduate of the law school. I married in my thirtieth year.\nBut before talking to you of my marriage, I must tell you how I lived\nformerly, and what ideas I had of conjugal life. I led the life of so\nmany other so-called respectable people,\xe2\x80\x94that is, in debauchery. And\nlike the majority, while leading the life of a _d\xc3\xa9bauch\xc3\xa9_, I was\nconvinced that I was a man of irreproachable morality.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe idea that I had of my morality arose from the fact that in my\nfamily there was no knowledge of those special debaucheries, so common\nin the surroundings of land-owners, and also from the fact that my\nfather and my mother did not deceive each other. In consequence of\nthis, I had built from childhood a dream of high and poetical conjugal\nlife. My wife was to be perfection itself, our mutual love was to be\nincomparable, the purity of our conjugal life stainless. I thought\nthus, and all the time I marvelled at the nobility of my projects.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the same time, I passed ten years of my adult life without hurrying\ntoward marriage, and I led what I called the well-regulated and\nreasonable life of a bachelor. I was proud of it before my friends, and\nbefore all men of my age who abandoned themselves to all sorts of\nspecial refinements. I was not a seducer, I had no unnatural tastes, I\ndid not make debauchery the principal object of my life; but I found\npleasure within the limits of society\xe2\x80\x99s rules, and innocently believed\nmyself a profoundly moral being. The women with whom I had relations\ndid not belong to me alone, and I asked of them nothing but the\npleasure of the moment.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn all this I saw nothing abnormal. On the contrary, from the fact\nthat I did not engage my heart, but paid in cash, I supposed that I was\nhonest. I avoided those women who, by attaching themselves to me, or\npresenting me with a child, could bind my future. Moreover, perhaps\nthere may have been children or attachments; but I so arranged matters\nthat I could not become aware of them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd living thus, I considered myself a perfectly honest man. I did not\nunderstand that debauchery does not consist simply in physical acts,\nthat no matter what physical ignominy does not yet constitute\ndebauchery, and that real debauchery consists in freedom from the moral\nbonds toward a woman with whom one enters into carnal relations, and I\nregarded _this freedom_ as a merit. I remember that I once tortured\nmyself exceedingly for having forgotten to pay a woman who probably had\ngiven herself to me through love. I only became tranquil again when,\nhaving sent her the money, I had thus shown her that I did not consider\nmyself as in any way bound to her. Oh, do not shake your head as if you\nwere in agreement with me (he cried suddenly with vehemence). I know\nthese tricks. All of you, and you especially, if you are not a rare\nexception, have the same ideas that I had then. If you are in agreement\nwith me, it is now only. Formerly you did not think so. No more did I;\nand, if I had been told what I have just told you, that which has\nhappened would not have happened. However, it is all the same. Excuse\nme (he continued): the truth is that it is frightful, frightful,\nfrightful, this abyss of errors and debaucheries in which we live face\nto face with the real question of the rights of woman.\xe2\x80\x9d . . .\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by the \xe2\x80\x98real\xe2\x80\x99 question of the rights of woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe question of the nature of this special being, organized otherwise\nthan man, and how this being and man ought to view the wife. . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes: for ten years I lived the most revolting existence, while\ndreaming of the noblest love, and even in the name of that love. Yes, I\nwant to tell you how I killed my wife, and for that I must tell you how\nI debauched myself. I killed her before I knew her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI killed _the_ wife when I first tasted sensual joys without love, and\nthen it was that I killed _my_ wife. Yes, sir: it is only after having\nsuffered, after having tortured myself, that I have come to understand\nthe root of things, that I have come to understand my crimes. Thus you\nwill see where and how began the drama that has led me to misfortune.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is necessary to go back to my sixteenth year, when I was still at\nschool, and my elder brother a first-year student. I had not yet known\nwomen but, like all the unfortunate children of our society, I was\nalready no longer innocent. I was tortured, as you were, I am sure, and\nas are tortured ninety-nine one-hundredths of our boys. I lived in a\nfrightful dread, I prayed to God, and I prostrated myself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was already perverted in imagination, but the last steps remained to\nbe taken. I could still escape, when a friend of my brother, a very gay\nstudent, one of those who are called good fellows,\xe2\x80\x94that is, the\ngreatest of scamps,\xe2\x80\x94and who had taught us to drink and play cards, took\nadvantage of a night of intoxication to drag us THERE. We started. My\nbrother, as innocent as I, fell that night, and I, a mere lad of\nsixteen, polluted myself and helped to pollute a sister-woman, without\nunderstanding what I did. Never had I heard from my elders that what I\nthus did was bad. It is true that there are the ten commandments of the\nBible; but the commandments are made only to be recited before the\npriests at examinations, and even then are not as exacting as the\ncommandments in regard to the use of _ut_ in conditional propositions.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus, from my elders, whose opinion I esteemed, I had never heard that\nthis was reprehensible. On the contrary, I had heard people whom I\nrespected say that it was good. I had heard that my struggles and my\nsufferings would be appeased after this act. I had heard it and read\nit. I had heard from my elders that it was excellent for the health,\nand my friends have always seemed to believe that it contained I know\nnot what merit and valor. So nothing is seen in it but what is\npraiseworthy. As for the danger of disease, it is a foreseen danger.\nDoes not the government guard against it? And even science corrupts\nus.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow so, science?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the doctors, the pontiffs of science. Who pervert young people by\nlaying down such rules of hygiene? Who pervert women by devising and\nteaching them ways by which not to have children?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes: if only a hundredth of the efforts spent in curing diseases were\nspent in curing debauchery, disease would long ago have ceased to\nexist, whereas now all efforts are employed, not in extirpating\ndebauchery, but in favoring it, by assuring the harmlessness of the\nconsequences. Besides, it is not a question of that. It is a question\nof this frightful thing that has happened to me, as it happens to\nnine-tenths, if not more, not only of the men of our society, but of\nall societies, even peasants,\xe2\x80\x94this frightful thing that I had fallen,\nand not because I was subjected to the natural seduction of a certain\nwoman. No, no woman seduced me. I fell because the surroundings in\nwhich I found myself saw in this degrading thing only a legitimate\nfunction, useful to the health; because others saw in it simply a\nnatural amusement, not only excusable, but even innocent in a young\nman. I did not understand that it was a fall, and I began to give\nmyself to those pleasures (partly from desire and partly from\nnecessity) which I was led to believe were characteristic of my age,\njust as I had begun to drink and smoke.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet there was in this first fall something peculiar and touching.\nI remember that straightway I was filled with such a profound sadness\nthat I had a desire to weep, to weep over the loss forever of my\nrelations with woman. Yes, my relations with woman were lost forever.\nPure relations with women, from that time forward, I could no longer\nhave. I had become what is called a voluptuary; and to be a voluptuary\nis a physical condition like the condition of a victim of the morphine\nhabit, of a drunkard, and of a smoker.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as the victim of the morphine habit, the drunkard, the smoker, is\nno longer a normal man, so the man who has known several women for his\npleasure is no longer normal? He is abnormal forever. He is a\nvoluptuary. Just as the drunkard and the victim of the morphine habit\nmay be recognized by their face and manner, so we may recognize a\nvoluptuary. He may repress himself and struggle, but nevermore will he\nenjoy simple, pure, and fraternal relations toward woman. By his way of\nglancing at a young woman one may at once recognize a voluptuary; and I\nbecame a voluptuary, and I have remained one.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, so it is; and that went farther and farther with all sorts of\nvariations. My God! when I remember all my cowardly acts and bad deeds,\nI am frightened. And I remember that \xe2\x80\x98me\xe2\x80\x99 who, during that period, was\nstill the butt of his comrades\xe2\x80\x99 ridicule on account of his innocence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when I hear people talk of the gilded youth, of the officers, of\nthe Parisians, and all these gentlemen, and myself, living wild lives\nat the age of thirty, and who have on our consciences hundreds of\ncrimes toward women, terrible and varied, when we enter a parlor or a\nball-room, washed, shaven, and perfumed, with very white linen, in\ndress coats or in uniform, as emblems of purity, oh, the disgust! There\nwill surely come a time, an epoch, when all these lives and all this\ncowardice will be unveiled!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, nevertheless, I lived, until the age of thirty, without abandoning\nfor a minute my intention of marrying, and building an elevated\nconjugal life; and with this in view I watched all young girls who\nmight suit me. I was buried in rottenness, and at the same time I\nlooked for virgins, whose purity was worthy of me! Many of them were\nrejected: they did not seem to me pure enough!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFinally I found one that I considered on a level with myself. She was\none of two daughters of a landed proprietor of Penza, formerly very\nrich and since ruined. To tell the truth, without false modesty, they\npursued me and finally captured me. The mother (the father was away)\nlaid all sorts of traps, and one of these, a trip in a boat, decided my\nfuture.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI made up my mind at the end of the aforesaid trip one night, by\nmoonlight, on our way home, while I was sitting beside her. I admired\nher slender body, whose charming shape was moulded by a jersey, and her\ncurling hair, and I suddenly concluded that _this was she_. It seemed\nto me on that beautiful evening that she understood all that I thought\nand felt, and I thought and felt the most elevating things.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, it was only the jersey that was so becoming to her, and her\ncurly hair, and also the fact that I had spent the day beside her, and\nthat I desired a more intimate relation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI returned home enthusiastic, and I persuaded myself that she realized\nthe highest perfection, and that for that reason she was worthy to be\nmy wife, and the next day I made to her a proposal of marriage.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, say what you will, we live in such an abyss of falsehood, that,\nunless some event strikes us a blow on the head, as in my case, we\ncannot awaken. What confusion! Out of the thousands of men who marry,\nnot only among us, but also among the people, scarcely will you find a\nsingle one who has not previously married at least ten times. (It is\ntrue that there now exist, at least so I have heard, pure young people\nwho feel and know that this is not a joke, but a serious matter. May\nGod come to their aid! But in my time there was not to be found one\nsuch in a thousand.)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd all know it, and pretend not to know it. In all the novels are\ndescribed down to the smallest details the feelings of the characters,\nthe lakes and brambles around which they walk; but, when it comes to\ndescribing their _great_ love, not a word is breathed of what _He_, the\ninteresting character, has previously done, not a word about his\nfrequenting of disreputable houses, or his association with\nnursery-maids, cooks, and the wives of others.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if anything is said of these things, such _improper_ novels are\nnot allowed in the hands of young girls. All men have the air of\nbelieving, in presence of maidens, that these corrupt pleasures, in\nwhich _everybody_ takes part, do not exist, or exist only to a very\nsmall extent. They pretend it so carefully that they succeed in\nconvincing themselves of it. As for the poor young girls, they believe\nit quite seriously, just as my poor wife believed it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember that, being already engaged, I showed her my \xe2\x80\x98memoirs,\xe2\x80\x99\nfrom which she could learn more or less of my past, and especially my\nlast _liaison_ which she might perhaps have discovered through the\ngossip of some third party. It was for this last reason, for that\nmatter, that I felt the necessity of communicating these memoirs to\nher. I can still see her fright, her despair, her bewilderment, when\nshe had learned and understood it. She was on the point of breaking the\nengagement. What a lucky thing it would have been for both of us!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPosdnicheff was silent for a moment, and then resumed:\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, no! It is better that things happened as they did, better!\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe cried. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a good thing for me. Besides, it makes no difference.\nI was saying that in these cases it is the poor young girls who are\ndeceived. As for the mothers, the mothers especially, informed by their\nhusbands, they know all, and, while pretending to believe in the purity\nof the young man, they act as if they did not believe in it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey know what bait must be held out to people for themselves and\ntheir daughters. We men sin through ignorance, and a determination not\nto learn. As for the women, they know very well that the noblest and\nmost poetic love, as we call it, depends, not on moral qualities, but\non the physical intimacy, and also on the manner of doing the hair, and\nthe color and shape.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk an experienced coquette, who has undertaken to seduce a man, which\nshe would prefer,\xe2\x80\x94to be convicted, in presence of the man whom she is\nengaged in conquering, of falsehood, perversity, cruelty, or to appear\nbefore him in an ill-fitting dress, or a dress of an unbecoming color.\nShe will prefer the first alternative. She knows very well that we\nsimply lie when we talk of our elevated sentiments, that we seek only\nthe possession of her body, and that because of that we will forgive\nher every sort of baseness, but will not forgive her a costume of an\nugly shade, without taste or fit.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd these things she knows by reason, where as the maiden knows them\nonly by instinct, like the animal. Hence these abominable jerseys,\nthese artificial humps on the back, these bare shoulders, arms, and\nthroats.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWomen, especially those who have passed through the school of\nmarriage, know very well that conversations upon elevated subjects are\nonly conversations, and that man seeks and desires the body and all\nthat ornaments the body. Consequently, they act accordingly? If we\nreject conventional explanations, and view the life of our upper and\nlower classes as it is, with all its shamelessness, it is only a vast\nperversity. You do not share this opinion? Permit me, I am going to\nprove it to you (said he, interrupting me).\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say that the women of our society live for a different interest\nfrom that which actuates fallen women. And I say no, and I am going to\nprove it to you. If beings differ from one another according to the\npurpose of their life, according to their _inner life_, this will\nnecessarily be reflected also in their _outer life_, and their exterior\nwill be very different. Well, then, compare the wretched, the despised,\nwith the women of the highest society: the same dresses, the same\nfashions, the same perfumeries, the same passion for jewelry, for\nbrilliant and very expensive articles, the same amusements, dances,\nmusic, and songs. The former attract by all possible means; so do the\nlatter. No difference, none whatever!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and I, too, was captivated by jerseys, bustles, and curly hair.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it was very easy to capture me, since I was brought up under\nartificial conditions, like cucumbers in a hothouse. Our too abundant\nnourishment, together with complete physical idleness, is nothing but\nsystematic excitement of the imagination. The men of our society are\nfed and kept like reproductive stallions. It is sufficient to close the\nvalve,\xe2\x80\x94that is, for a young man to live a quiet life for some time,\xe2\x80\x94to\nproduce as an immediate result a restlessness, which, becoming\nexaggerated by reflection through the prism of our unnatural life,\nprovokes the illusion of love.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll our idyls and marriage, all, are the result for the most part of\nour eating. Does that astonish you? For my part, I am astonished that\nwe do not see it. Not far from my estate this spring some moujiks were\nworking on a railway embankment. You know what a peasant\xe2\x80\x99s food\nis,\xe2\x80\x94bread, _kvass_,[*] onions. With this frugal nourishment he lives,\nhe is alert, he makes light work in the fields. But on the railway this\nbill of fare becomes _cacha_ and a pound of meat. Only he restores this\nmeat by sixteen hours of labor pushing loads weighing twelve hundred\npounds.\n\n[*] _Kvass_, a sort of cider.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we, who eat two pounds of meat and game, we who absorb all sorts\nof heating drinks and food, how do we expend it? In sensual excesses.\nIf the valve is open, all goes well; but close it, as I had closed it\ntemporarily before my marriage, and immediately there will result an\nexcitement which, deformed by novels, verses, music, by our idle and\nluxurious life, will give a love of the finest water. I, too, fell in\nlove, as everybody does, and there were transports, emotions, poesy;\nbut really all this passion was prepared by mamma and the dressmakers.\nIf there had been no trips in boats, no well-fitted garments, etc., if\nmy wife had worn some shapeless blouse, and I had seen her thus at her\nhome, I should not have been seduced.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd note, also, this falsehood, of which all are guilty; the way in\nwhich marriages are made. What could there be more natural? The young\ngirl is marriageable, she should marry. What simpler, provided the\nyoung person is not a monster, and men can be found with a desire to\nmarry? Well, no, here begins a new hypocrisy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFormerly, when the maiden arrived at a favorable age, her marriage was\narranged by her parents. That was done, that is done still, throughout\nhumanity, among the Chinese, the Hindoos, the Mussulmans, and among our\ncommon people also. Things are so managed in at least ninety-nine per\ncent. of the families of the entire human race.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly we riotous livers have imagined that this way was bad, and have\ninvented another. And this other,\xe2\x80\x94what is it? It is this. The young\ngirls are seated, and the gentlemen walk up and down before them, as in\na bazaar, and make their choice. The maidens wait and think, but do not\ndare to say: \xe2\x80\x98Take me, young man, me and not her. Look at these\nshoulders and the rest.\xe2\x80\x99 We males walk up and down, and estimate the\nmerchandise, and then we discourse upon the rights of woman, upon the\nliberty that she acquires, I know not how, in the theatrical halls.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what is to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d said I to him. \xe2\x80\x9cShall the woman make the\nadvances?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know. But, if it is a question of equality, let the equality\nbe complete. Though it has been found that to contract marriages\nthrough the agency of match-makers is humiliating, it is nevertheless a\nthousand times preferable to our system. There the rights and the\nchances are equal; here the woman is a slave, exhibited in the market.\nBut as she cannot bend to her condition, or make advances herself,\nthere begins that other and more abominable lie which is sometimes\ncalled _going into society_, sometimes _amusing one\xe2\x80\x99s self_, and which\nis really nothing but the hunt for a husband.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut say to a mother or to her daughter that they are engaged only in a\nhunt for a husband. God! What an offence! Yet they can do nothing else,\nand have nothing else to do; and the terrible feature of it all is to\nsee sometimes very young, poor, and innocent maidens haunted solely by\nsuch ideas. If only, I repeat, it were done frankly; but it is always\naccompanied with lies and babble of this sort:\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Ah, the descent of species! How interesting it is!\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Lily is much interested in painting.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Shall you go to the Exposition? How charming it is!\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And the troika, and the plays, and the symphony. Ah, how adorable!\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98My Lise is passionately fond of music.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And you, why do you not share these convictions?\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd through all this verbiage, all have but one single idea: \xe2\x80\x98Take me,\ntake my Lise. No, me! Only try!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know,\xe2\x80\x9d suddenly continued Posdnicheff, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this power of\nwomen from which the world suffers arises solely from what I have just\nspoken of?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by the power of women?\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody, on the\ncontrary, complains that women have not sufficient rights, that they\nare in subjection.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it; that\xe2\x80\x99s it exactly,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, vivaciously. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is just\nwhat I mean, and that is the explanation of this extraordinary\nphenomenon, that on the one hand woman is reduced to the lowest degree\nof humiliation and on the other hand she reigns over everything. See\nthe Jews: with their power of money, they avenge their subjection, just\nas the women do. \xe2\x80\x98Ah! you wish us to be only merchants? All right;\nremaining merchants, we will get possession of you,\xe2\x80\x99 say the Jews. \xe2\x80\x98Ah!\nyou wish us to be only objects of sensuality? All right; by the aid of\nsensuality we will bend you beneath our yoke,\xe2\x80\x99 say the women.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe absence of the rights of woman does not consist in the fact that\nshe has not the right to vote, or the right to sit on the bench, but in\nthe fact that in her affectional relations she is not the equal of man,\nshe has not the right to abstain, to choose instead of being chosen.\nYou say that that would be abnormal. Very well! But then do not let man\nenjoy these rights, while his companion is deprived of them, and finds\nherself obliged to make use of the coquetry by which she governs, so\nthat the result is that man chooses \xe2\x80\x98formally,\xe2\x80\x99 whereas really it is\nwoman who chooses. As soon as she is in possession of her means, she\nabuses them, and acquires a terrible supremacy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where do you see this exceptional power?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere? Why, everywhere, in everything. Go see the stores in the large\ncities. There are millions there, millions. It is impossible to\nestimate the enormous quantity of labor that is expended there. In\nnine-tenths of these stores is there anything whatever for the use of\nmen? All the luxury of life is demanded and sustained by woman. Count\nthe factories; the greater part of them are engaged in making feminine\nornaments. Millions of men, generations of slaves, die toiling like\nconvicts simply to satisfy the whims of our companions.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWomen, like queens, keep nine-tenths of the human race as prisoners of\nwar, or as prisoners at hard labor. And all this because they have been\nhumiliated, because they have been deprived of rights equal to those\nwhich men enjoy. They take revenge for our sensuality; they catch us in\ntheir nets.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the whole thing is there. Women have made of themselves such a\nweapon to act upon the senses that a young man, and even an old man,\ncannot remain tranquil in their presence. Watch a popular festival, or\nour receptions or ball-rooms. Woman well knows her influence there. You\nwill see it in her triumphant smiles.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as a young man advances toward a woman, directly he falls\nunder the influence of this opium, and loses his head. Long ago I felt\nill at ease when I saw a woman too well adorned,\xe2\x80\x94whether a woman of the\npeople with her red neckerchief and her looped skirt, or a woman of our\nown society in her ball-room dress. But now it simply terrifies me. I\nsee in it a danger to men, something contrary to the laws; and I feel a\ndesire to call a policeman, to appeal for defence from some quarter, to\ndemand that this dangerous object be removed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this is not a joke, by any means. I am convinced, I am sure, that\nthe time will come\xe2\x80\x94and perhaps it is not far distant\xe2\x80\x94when the world\nwill understand this, and will be astonished that a society could exist\nin which actions as harmful as those which appeal to sensuality by\nadorning the body as our companions do were allowed. As well set traps\nalong our public streets, or worse than that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat, then, was the way in which I was captured. I was in love, as it\nis called; not only did _she_ appear to me a perfect being, but I\nconsidered myself a white blackbird. It is a commonplace fact that\nthere is no one so low in the world that he cannot find some one viler\nthan himself, and consequently puff with pride and self-contentment. I\nwas in that situation. I did not marry for money. Interest was foreign\nto the affair, unlike the marriages of most of my acquaintances, who\nmarried either for money or for relations. First, I was rich, she was\npoor. Second, I was especially proud of the fact that, while others\nmarried with an intention of continuing their polygamic life as\nbachelors, it was my firm intention to live monogamically after my\nengagement and the wedding, and my pride swelled immeasurably.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I was a wretch, convinced that I was an angel. The period of my\nengagement did not last long. I cannot remember those days without\nshame. What an abomination!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is generally agreed that love is a moral sentiment, a community of\nthought rather than of sense. If that is the case, this community of\nthought ought to find expression in words and conversation. Nothing of\nthe sort. It was extremely difficult for us to talk with each other.\nWhat a toil of Sisyphus was our conversation! Scarcely had we thought\nof something to say, and said it, when we had to resume our silence and\ntry to discover new subjects. Literally, we did not know what to say to\neach other. All that we could think of concerning the life that was\nbefore us and our home was said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then what? If we had been animals, we should have known that we\nhad not to talk. But here, on the contrary, it was necessary to talk,\nand there were no resources! For that which occupied our minds was not\na thing to be expressed in words.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then that silly custom of eating bon-bons, that brutal gluttony\nfor sweetmeats, those abominable preparations for the wedding, those\ndiscussions with mamma upon the apartments, upon the sleeping-rooms,\nupon the bedding, upon the morning-gowns, upon the wrappers, the linen,\nthe costumes! Understand that if people married according to the old\nfashion, as this old man said just now, then these eiderdown coverlets\nand this bedding would all be sacred details; but with us, out of ten\nmarried people there is scarcely to be found one who, I do not say\nbelieves in sacraments (whether he believes or not is a matter of\nindifference to us), but believes in what he promises. Out of a hundred\nmen, there is scarcely one who has not married before, and out of fifty\nscarcely one who has not made up his mind to deceive his wife.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe great majority look upon this journey to the church as a condition\nnecessary to the possession of a certain woman. Think then of the\nsupreme significance which material details must take on. Is it not a\nsort of sale, in which a maiden is given over to a _d\xc3\xa9bauch\xc3\xa9_, the sale\nbeing surrounded with the most agreeable details?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll marry in this way. And I did like the rest. If the young people\nwho dream of the honeymoon only knew what a disillusion it is, and\nalways a disillusion! I really do not know why all think it necessary\nto conceal it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne day I was walking among the shows in Paris, when, attracted by a\nsign, I entered an establishment to see a bearded woman and a\nwater-dog. The woman was a man in disguise, and the dog was an ordinary\ndog, covered with a sealskin, and swimming in a bath. It was not in the\nleast interesting, but the Barnum accompanied me to the exit very\ncourteously, and, in addressing the people who were coming in, made an\nappeal to my testimony. \xe2\x80\x98Ask the gentleman if it is not worth seeing!\nCome in, come in! It only costs a franc!\xe2\x80\x99 And in my confusion I did not\ndare to answer that there was nothing curious to be seen, and it was\nupon my false shame that the Barnum must have counted.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be the same with the persons who have passed through the\nabominations of the honeymoon. They do not dare to undeceive their\nneighbor. And I did the same.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe felicities of the honeymoon do not exist. On the contrary, it is a\nperiod of uneasiness, of shame, of pity, and, above all, of _ennui_,\xe2\x80\x94of\nferocious _ennui_. It is something like the feeling of a youth when he\nis beginning to smoke. He desires to vomit; he drivels, and swallows\nhis drivel, pretending to enjoy this little amusement. The vice of\nmarriage . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! _Vice?_\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you are talking of one of the most natural\nthings.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNatural!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cNatural! No, I consider on the contrary that it is\nagainst nature, and it is I, a perverted man, who have reached this\nconviction. What would it be, then, if I had not known corruption? To a\nyoung girl, to every unperverted young girl, it is an act extremely\nunnatural, just as it is to children. My sister married, when very\nyoung, a man twice her own age, and who was utterly corrupt. I remember\nhow astonished we were the night of her wedding, when, pale and covered\nwith tears, she fled from her husband, her whole body trembling, saying\nthat for nothing in the world would she tell what he wanted of her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say natural? It is natural to eat; that is a pleasant, agreeable\nfunction, which no one is ashamed to perform from the time of his\nbirth. No, it is not natural. A pure young girl wants one\nthing,\xe2\x80\x94children. Children, yes, not a lover.\xe2\x80\x9d . . .\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, with astonishment, \xe2\x80\x9chow would the human race continue?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what is the use of its continuing?\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined, vehemently.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! What is the use? But then we should not exist.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why is it necessary that we should exist?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, to live, to be sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why live? The Schopenhauers, the Hartmanns, and all the Buddhists,\nsay that the greatest happiness is Nirvana, Non-Life; and they are\nright in this sense,\xe2\x80\x94that human happiness is coincident with the\nannihilation of \xe2\x80\x98Self.\xe2\x80\x99 Only they do not express themselves well. They\nsay that Humanity should annihilate itself to avoid its sufferings,\nthat its object should be to destroy itself. Now the object of Humanity\ncannot be to avoid sufferings by annihilation, since suffering is the\nresult of activity. The object of activity cannot consist in\nsuppressing its consequences. The object of Man, as of Humanity, is\nhappiness, and, to attain it, Humanity has a law which it must carry\nout. This law consists in the union of beings. This union is thwarted\nby the passions. And that is why, if the passions disappear, the union\nwill be accomplished. Humanity then will have carried out the law, and\nwill have no further reason to exist.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd before Humanity carries out the law?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the meantime it will have the sign of the unfulfilled law, and the\nexistence of physical love. As long as this love shall exist, and\nbecause of it, generations will be born, one of which will finally\nfulfil the law. When at last the law shall be fulfilled, the Human Race\nwill be annihilated. At least it is impossible for us to conceive of\nLife in the perfect union of people.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrange theory!\xe2\x80\x9d cried I.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrange in what? According to all the doctrines of the Church, the\nworld will have an end. Science teaches the same fatal conclusions.\nWhy, then, is it strange that the same thing should result from moral\nDoctrine? \xe2\x80\x98Let those who can, contain,\xe2\x80\x99 said Christ. And I take this\npassage literally, as it is written. That morality may exist between\npeople in their worldly relations, they must make complete chastity\ntheir object. In tending toward this end, man humiliates himself. When\nhe shall reach the last degree of humiliation, we shall have moral\nmarriage.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if man, as in our society, tends only toward physical love, though\nhe may clothe it with pretexts and the false forms of marriage, he will\nhave only permissible debauchery, he will know only the same immoral\nlife in which I fell and caused my wife to fall, a life which we call\nthe honest life of the family. Think what a perversion of ideas must\narise when the happiest situation of man, liberty, chastity, is looked\nupon as something wretched and ridiculous. The highest ideal, the best\nsituation of woman, to be pure, to be a vestal, a virgin, excites fear\nand laughter in our society. How many, how many young girls sacrifice\ntheir purity to this Moloch of opinion by marrying rascals that they\nmay not remain virgins,\xe2\x80\x94that is, superiors! Through fear of finding\nthemselves in that ideal state, they ruin themselves.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I did not understand formerly, I did not understand that the words\nof the Gospel, that \xe2\x80\x98he who looks upon a woman to lust after her has\nalready committed adultery,\xe2\x80\x99 do not apply to the wives of others, but\nnotably and especially to our own wives. I did not understand this, and\nI thought that the honeymoon and all of my acts during that period were\nvirtuous, and that to satisfy one\xe2\x80\x99s desires with his wife is an\neminently chaste thing. Know, then, that I consider these departures,\nthese isolations, which young married couples arrange with the\npermission of their parents, as nothing else than a license to engage\nin debauchery.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw, then, in this nothing bad or shameful, and, hoping for great\njoys, I began to live the honeymoon. And very certainly none of these\njoys followed. But I had faith, and was determined to have them, cost\nwhat they might. But the more I tried to secure them, the less I\nsucceeded. All this time I felt anxious, ashamed, and weary. Soon I\nbegan to suffer. I believe that on the third or fourth day I found my\nwife sad and asked her the reason. I began to embrace her, which in my\nopinion was all that she could desire. She put me away with her hand,\nand began to weep.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt what? She could not tell me. She was filled with sorrow, with\nanguish. Probably her tortured nerves had suggested to her the truth\nabout the baseness of our relations, but she found no words in which to\nsay it. I began to question her; she answered that she missed her\nabsent mother. It seemed to me that she was not telling the truth. I\nsought to console her by maintaining silence in regard to her parents.\nI did not imagine that she felt herself simply overwhelmed, and that\nher parents had nothing to do with her sorrow. She did not listen to\nme, and I accused her of caprice. I began to laugh at her gently. She\ndried her tears, and began to reproach me, in hard and wounding terms,\nfor my selfishness and cruelty.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI looked at her. Her whole face expressed hatred, and hatred of me. I\ncannot describe to you the fright which this sight gave me. \xe2\x80\x98How?\nWhat?\xe2\x80\x99 thought I, \xe2\x80\x98love is the unity of souls, and here she hates me?\nMe? Why? But it is impossible! It is no longer she!\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tried to calm her. I came in conflict with an immovable and cold\nhostility, so that, having no time to reflect, I was seized with keen\nirritation. We exchanged disagreeable remarks. The impression of this\nfirst quarrel was terrible. I say quarrel, but the term is inexact. It\nwas the sudden discovery of the abyss that had been dug between us.\nLove was exhausted with the satisfaction of sensuality. We stood face\nto face in our true light, like two egoists trying to procure the\ngreatest possible enjoyment, like two individuals trying to mutually\nexploit each other.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo what I called our quarrel was our actual situation as it appeared\nafter the satisfaction of sensual desire. I did not realize that this\ncold hostility was our normal state, and that this first quarrel would\nsoon be drowned under a new flood of the intensest sensuality. I\nthought that we had disputed with each other, and had become\nreconciled, and that it would not happen again. But in this same\nhoneymoon there came a period of satiety, in which we ceased to be\nnecessary to each other, and a new quarrel broke out.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt became evident that the first was not a matter of chance. \xe2\x80\x98It was\ninevitable,\xe2\x80\x99 I thought. This second quarrel stupefied me the more,\nbecause it was based on an extremely unjust cause. It was something\nlike a question of money,\xe2\x80\x94and never had I haggled on that score; it was\neven impossible that I should do so in relation to her. I only remember\nthat, in answer to some remark that I made, she insinuated that it was\nmy intention to rule her by means of money, and that it was upon money\nthat I based my sole right over her. In short, something\nextraordinarily stupid and base, which was neither in my character nor\nin hers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was beside myself. I accused her of indelicacy. She made the same\naccusation against me, and the dispute broke out. In her words, in the\nexpression of her face, of her eyes, I noticed again the hatred that\nhad so astonished me before. With a brother, friends, my father, I had\noccasionally quarrelled, but never had there been between us this\nfierce spite. Some time passed. Our mutual hatred was again concealed\nbeneath an access of sensual desire, and I again consoled myself with\nthe reflection that these scenes were reparable faults.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut when they were repeated a third and a fourth time, I understood\nthat they were not simply faults, but a fatality that must happen\nagain. I was no longer frightened, I was simply astonished that I\nshould be precisely the one to live so uncomfortably with my wife, and\nthat the same thing did not happen in other households. I did not know\nthat in all households the same sudden changes take place, but that\nall, like myself, imagine that it is a misfortune exclusively reserved\nfor themselves alone, which they carefully conceal as shameful, not\nonly to others, but to themselves, like a bad disease.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was what happened to me. Begun in the early days, it continued\nand increased with characteristics of fury that were ever more\npronounced. At the bottom of my soul, from the first weeks, I felt that\nI was in a trap, that I had what I did not expect, and that marriage is\nnot a joy, but a painful trial. Like everybody else, I refused to\nconfess it (I should not have confessed it even now but for the\noutcome). Now I am astonished to think that I did not see my real\nsituation. It was so easy to perceive it, in view of those quarrels,\nbegun for reasons so trivial that afterwards one could not recall them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as it often happens among gay young people that, in the absence\nof jokes, they laugh at their own laughter, so we found no reasons for\nour hatred, and we hated each other because hatred was naturally\nboiling up in us. More extraordinary still was the absence of causes\nfor reconciliation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes words, explanations, or even tears, but sometimes, I\nremember, after insulting words, there tacitly followed embraces and\ndeclarations. Abomination! Why is it that I did not then perceive this\nbaseness?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll of us, men and women, are brought up in these aberrations of\nfeeling that we call love. I from childhood had prepared myself for\nthis thing, and I loved, and I loved during all my youth, and I was\njoyous in loving. It had been put into my head that it was the noblest\nand highest occupation in the world. But when this expected feeling\ncame at last, and I, a man, abandoned myself to it, the lie was pierced\nthrough and through. Theoretically a lofty love is conceivable;\npractically it is an ignoble and degrading thing, which it is equally\ndisgusting to talk about and to remember. It is not in vain that nature\nhas made ceremonies, but people pretend that the ignoble and the\nshameful is beautiful and lofty.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you brutally and briefly what were the first signs of my\nlove. I abandoned myself to beastly excesses, not only not ashamed of\nthem, but proud of them, giving no thought to the intellectual life of\nmy wife. And not only did I not think of her intellectual life, I did\nnot even consider her physical life.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was astonished at the origin of our hostility, and yet how clear it\nwas! This hostility is nothing but a protest of human nature against\nthe beast that enslaves it. It could not be otherwise. This hatred was\nthe hatred of accomplices in a crime. Was it not a crime that, this\npoor woman having become pregnant in the first month, our _liaison_\nshould have continued just the same?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou imagine that I am wandering from my story. Not at all. I am always\ngiving you an account of the events that led to the murder of my wife.\nThe imbeciles! They think that I killed my wife on the 5th of October.\nIt was long before that that I immolated her, just as they all kill\nnow. Understand well that in our society there is an idea shared by all\nthat woman procures man pleasure (and _vice versa_, probably, but I\nknow nothing of that, I only know my own case). _Wein, Weiber und\nGesang_. So say the poets in their verses: Wine, women, and song!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it were only that! Take all the poetry, the painting, the\nsculpture, beginning with Pouschkine\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Little Feet,\xe2\x80\x99 with \xe2\x80\x98Venus and\nPhryne,\xe2\x80\x99 and you will see that woman is only a means of enjoyment. That\nis what she is at Trouba,[*] at Gratchevka, and in a court ball-room.\nAnd think of this diabolical trick: if she were a thing without moral\nvalue, it might be said that woman is a fine morsel; but, in the first\nplace, these knights assure us that they adore woman (they adore her\nand look upon her, however, as a means of enjoyment), then all assure\nus that they esteem woman. Some give up their seats to her, pick up her\nhandkerchief; others recognize in her a right to fill all offices,\nparticipate in government, etc., but, in spite of all that, the\nessential point remains the same. She is, she remains, an object of\nsensual desire, and she knows it. It is slavery, for slavery is nothing\nelse than the utilization of the labor of some for the enjoyment of\nothers. That slavery may not exist people must refuse to enjoy the\nlabor of others, and look upon it as a shameful act and as a sin.\n\n[*] A suburb of Moscow.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cActually, this is what happens. They abolish the external form, they\nsuppress the formal sales of slaves, and then they imagine and assure\nothers that slavery is abolished. They are unwilling to see that it\nstill exists, since people, as before, like to profit by the labor of\nothers, and think it good and just. This being given, there will always\nbe found beings stronger or more cunning than others to profit thereby.\nThe same thing happens in the emancipation of woman. At bottom feminine\nservitude consists entirely in her assimilation with a means of\npleasure. They excite woman, they give her all sorts of rights equal to\nthose of men, but they continue to look upon her as an object of\nsensual desire, and thus they bring her up from infancy and in public\nopinion.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is always the humiliated and corrupt serf, and man remains always\nthe debauched Master. Yes, to abolish slavery, public opinion must\nadmit that it is shameful to exploit one\xe2\x80\x99s neighbor, and, to make woman\nfree, public opinion must admit that it is shameful to consider woman\nas an instrument of pleasure.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe emancipation of woman is not to be effected in the public courts\nor in the chamber of deputies, but in the sleeping chamber.\nProstitution is to be combated, not in the houses of ill-fame, but in\nthe family. They free woman in the public courts and in the chamber of\ndeputies, but she remains an instrument. Teach her, as she is taught\namong us, to look upon herself as such, and she will always remain an\ninferior being. Either, with the aid of the rascally doctors, she will\ntry to prevent conception, and descend, not to the level of an animal,\nbut to the level of a thing; or she will be what she is in the great\nmajority of cases,\xe2\x80\x94sick, hysterical, wretched, without hope of\nspiritual progress.\xe2\x80\x9d . . .\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why that?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! the most astonishing thing is that no one is willing to see this\nthing, evident as it is, which the doctors must understand, but which\nthey take good care not to do. Man does not wish to know the law of\nnature,\xe2\x80\x94children. But children are born and become an embarrassment.\nThen man devises means of avoiding this embarrassment. We have not yet\nreached the low level of Europe, nor Paris, nor the \xe2\x80\x98system of two\nchildren,\xe2\x80\x99 nor Mahomet. We have discovered nothing, because we have\ngiven it no thought. We feel that there is something bad in the two\nfirst means; but we wish to preserve the family, and our view of woman\nis still worse.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith us woman must be at the same time mistress and nurse, and her\nstrength is not sufficient. That is why we have hysteria, nervous\nattacks, and, among the peasants, witchcraft. Note that among the young\ngirls of the peasantry this state of things does not exist, but only\namong the wives, and the wives who live with their husbands. The reason\nis clear, and this is the cause of the intellectual and moral decline\nof woman, and of her abasement.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they would only reflect what a grand work for the wife is the\nperiod of gestation! In her is forming the being who continues us, and\nthis holy work is thwarted and rendered painful . . . by what? It is\nfrightful to think of it! And after that they talk of the liberties and\nthe rights of woman! It is like the cannibals fattening their prisoners\nin order to devour them, and assuring these unfortunates at the same\ntime that their rights and their liberties are guarded!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAll this was new to me, and astonished me very much.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if this is so,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cit follows that one may love his wife\nonly once every two years; and as man\xe2\x80\x9d . . .\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd as man has need of her, you are going to say. At least, so the\npriests of science assure us. I would force these priests to fulfil the\nfunction of these women, who, in their opinion, are necessary to man. I\nwonder what song they would sing then. Assure man that he needs brandy,\ntobacco, opium, and he will believe those poisons necessary. It follows\nthat God did not know how to arrange matters properly, since, without\nasking the opinions of the priests, he has combined things as they are.\nMan needs, so they have decided, to satisfy his sensual desire, and\nhere this function is disturbed by the birth and the nursing of\nchildren.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, then, is to be done? Why, apply to the priests; they will\narrange everything, and they have really discovered a way. When, then,\nwill these rascals with their lies be uncrowned! It is high time. We\nhave had enough of them. People go mad, and shoot each other with\nrevolvers, and always because of that! And how could it be otherwise?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne would say that the animals know that descent continues their race,\nand that they follow a certain law in regard thereto. Only man does not\nknow this, and is unwilling to know it. He cares only to have as much\nsensual enjoyment as possible. The king of nature,\xe2\x80\x94man! In the name of\nhis love he kills half the human race. Of woman, who ought to be his\naid in the movement of humanity toward liberty, he makes, in the name\nof his pleasures, not an aid, but an enemy. Who is it that everywhere\nputs a check upon the progressive movement of humanity? Woman. Why is\nit so?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the reason that I have given, and for that reason only.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, much worse than the animal is man when he does not live as a man.\nThus was I. The horrible part is that I believed, inasmuch as I did not\nallow myself to be seduced by other women that I was leading an honest\nfamily life, that I was a very moral being, and that if we had\nquarrels, the fault was in my wife, and in her character.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is evident that the fault was not in her. She was like\neverybody else, like the majority. She was brought up according to the\nprinciples exacted by the situation of our society,\xe2\x80\x94that is, as all the\nyoung girls of our wealthy classes, without exception, are brought up,\nand as they cannot fail to be brought up. How many times we hear or\nread of reflections upon the abnormal condition of women, and upon what\nthey ought to be. But these are only vain words. The education of women\nresults from the real and not imaginary view which the world entertains\nof women\xe2\x80\x99s vocation. According to this view, the condition of women\nconsists in procuring pleasure and it is to that end that her education\nis directed. From her infancy she is taught only those things that are\ncalculated to increase her charm. Every young girl is accustomed to\nthink only of that.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs the serfs were brought up solely to please their masters, so woman\nis brought up to attract men. It cannot be otherwise. But you will say,\nperhaps, that that applies only to young girls who are badly brought\nup, but that there is another education, an education that is serious,\nin the schools, an education in the dead languages, an education in the\ninstitutions of midwifery, an education in medical courses, and in\nother courses. It is false.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery sort of feminine education has for its sole object the\nattraction of men.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome attract by music or curly hair, others by science or by civic\nvirtue. The object is the same, and cannot be otherwise (since no other\nobject exists),\xe2\x80\x94to seduce man in order to possess him. Imagine courses\nof instruction for women and feminine science without men,\xe2\x80\x94that is,\nlearned women, and men not _knowing_ them as learned. Oh, no! No\neducation, no instruction can change woman as long as her highest ideal\nshall be marriage and not virginity, freedom from sensuality. Until\nthat time she will remain a serf. One need only imagine, forgetting the\nuniversality of the case, the conditions in which our young girls are\nbrought up, to avoid astonishment at the debauchery of the women of our\nupper classes. It is the opposite that would cause astonishment.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFollow my reasoning. From infancy garments, ornaments, cleanliness,\ngrace, dances, music, reading of poetry, novels, singing, the theatre,\nthe concert, for use within and without, according as women listen, or\npractice themselves. With that, complete physical idleness, an\nexcessive care of the body, a vast consumption of sweetmeats; and God\nknows how the poor maidens suffer from their own sensuality, excited by\nall these things. Nine out of ten are tortured intolerably during the\nfirst period of maturity, and afterward provided they do not marry at\nthe age of twenty. That is what we are unwilling to see, but those who\nhave eyes see it all the same. And even the majority of these\nunfortunate creatures are so excited by a hidden sensuality (and it is\nlucky if it is hidden) that they are fit for nothing. They become\nanimated only in the presence of men. Their whole life is spent in\npreparations for coquetry, or in coquetry itself. In the presence of\nmen they become too animated; they begin to live by sensual energy. But\nthe moment the man goes away, the life stops.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that, not in the presence of a certain man, but in the presence of\nany man, provided he is not utterly hideous. You will say that this is\nan exception. No, it is a rule. Only in some it is made very evident,\nin others less so. But no one lives by her own life; they are all\ndependent upon man. They cannot be otherwise, since to them the\nattraction of the greatest number of men is the ideal of life (young\ngirls and married women), and it is for this reason that they have no\nfeeling stronger than that of the animal need of every female who tries\nto attract the largest number of males in order to increase the\nopportunities for choice. So it is in the life of young girls, and so\nit continues during marriage. In the life of young girls it is\nnecessary in order to selection, and in marriage it is necessary in\norder to rule the husband. Only one thing suppresses or interrupts\nthese tendencies for a time,\xe2\x80\x94namely, children,\xe2\x80\x94and then only when the\nwoman is not a monster,\xe2\x80\x94that is, when she nurses her own children. Here\nagain the doctor interferes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith my wife, who desired to nurse her own children, and who did nurse\nsix of them, it happened that the first child was sickly. The doctors,\nwho cynically undressed her and felt of her everywhere, and whom I had\nto thank and pay for these acts,\xe2\x80\x94these dear doctors decided that she\nought not to nurse her child, and she was temporarily deprived of the\nonly remedy for coquetry. A nurse finished the nursing of this\nfirst-born,\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, we profited by the poverty and ignorance of\na woman to steal her from her own little one in favor of ours, and for\nthat purpose we dressed her in a _kakoschnik_ trimmed with gold lace.\nNevertheless, that is not the question; but there was again awakened in\nmy wife that coquetry which had been sleeping during the nursing\nperiod. Thanks to that, she reawakened in me the torments of jealousy\nwhich I had formerly known, though in a much slighter degree.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, jealousy, that is another of the secrets of marriage known to all\nand concealed by all. Besides the general cause of the mutual hatred of\nhusbands and wives resulting from complicity in the pollution of a\nhuman being, and also from other causes, the inexhaustible source of\nmarital wounds is jealousy. But by tacit consent it is determined to\nconceal them from all, and we conceal them. Knowing them, each one\nsupposes in himself that it is an unfortunate peculiarity, and not a\ncommon destiny. So it was with me, and it had to be so. There cannot\nfail to be jealousy between husbands and wives who live immorally. If\nthey cannot sacrifice their pleasures for the welfare of their child,\nthey conclude therefrom, and truly, that they will not sacrifice their\npleasures for, I will not say happiness and tranquillity (since one may\nsin in secret), but even for the sake of conscience. Each one knows\nvery well that neither admits any high moral reasons for not betraying\nthe other, since in their mutual relations they fail in the\nrequirements of morality, and from that time distrust and watch each\nother.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what a frightful feeling of jealousy! I do not speak of that real\njealousy which has foundations (it is tormenting, but it promises an\nissue), but of that unconscious jealousy which inevitably accompanies\nevery immoral marriage, and which, having no cause, has no end. This\njealousy is frightful. Frightful, that is the word.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this is it. A young man speaks to my wife. He looks at her with a\nsmile, and, as it seems to me, he surveys her body. How does he dare to\nthink of her, to think of the possibility of a romance with her? And\nhow can she, seeing this, tolerate him? Not only does she tolerate him,\nbut she seems pleased. I even see that she puts herself to trouble on\nhis account. And in my soul there rises such a hatred for her that each\nof her words, each gesture, disgusts me. She notices it, she knows not\nwhat to do, and how assume an air of indifferent animation? Ah! I\nsuffer! That makes her gay, she is content. And my hatred increases\ntenfold, but I do not dare to give it free force, because at the bottom\nof my soul I know that there are no real reasons for it, and I remain\nin my seat, feigning indifference, and exaggerating my attention and\ncourtesy to _him_.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I get angry with myself. I desire to leave the room, to leave\nthem alone, and I do, in fact, go out; but scarcely am I outside when I\nam invaded by a fear of what is taking place within my absence. I go in\nagain, inventing some pretext. Or sometimes I do not go in; I remain\nnear the door, and listen. How can she humiliate herself and humiliate\nme by placing me in this cowardly situation of suspicion and espionage?\nOh, abomination! Oh, the wicked animal! And he too, what does he think\nof you? But he is like all men. He is what I was before my marriage. It\ngives him pleasure. He even smiles when he looks at me, as much as to\nsay: \xe2\x80\x98What have you to do with this? It is my turn now.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis feeling is horrible. Its burn is unendurable. To entertain this\nfeeling toward any one, to once suspect a man of lusting after my wife,\nwas enough to spoil this man forever in my eyes, as if he had been\nsprinkled with vitriol. Let me once become jealous of a being, and\nnevermore could I re-establish with him simple human relations, and my\neyes flashed when I looked at him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for my wife, so many times had I enveloped her with this moral\nvitriol, with this jealous hatred, that she was degraded thereby. In\nthe periods of this causeless hatred I gradually uncrowned her. I\ncovered her with shame in my imagination.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI invented impossible knaveries. I suspected, I am ashamed to say,\nthat she, this queen of \xe2\x80\x98The Thousand and One Nights,\xe2\x80\x99 deceived me with\nmy serf, under my very eyes, and laughing at me.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus, with each new access of jealousy (I speak always of causeless\njealousy), I entered into the furrow dug formerly by my filthy\nsuspicions, and I continually deepened it. She did the same thing. If I\nhave reasons to be jealous, she who knew my past had a thousand times\nmore. And she was more ill-natured in her jealousy than I. And the\nsufferings that I felt from her jealousy were different, and likewise\nvery painful.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe situation may be described thus. We are living more or less\ntranquilly. I am even gay and contented. Suddenly we start a\nconversation on some most commonplace subject, and directly she finds\nherself disagreeing with me upon matters concerning which we have been\ngenerally in accord. And furthermore I see that, without any necessity\ntherefor, she is becoming irritated. I think that she has a nervous\nattack, or else that the subject of conversation is really disagreeable\nto her. We talk of something else, and that begins again. Again she\ntorments me, and becomes irritated. I am astonished and look for a\nreason. Why? For what? She keeps silence, answers me with\nmonosyllables, evidently making allusions to something. I begin to\ndivine that the reason of all this is that I have taken a few walks in\nthe garden with her cousin, to whom I did not give even a thought. I\nbegin to divine, but I cannot say so. If I say so, I confirm her\nsuspicions. I interrogate her, I question her. She does not answer, but\nshe sees that I understand, and that confirms her suspicions.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What is the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x99 I ask.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Nothing, I am as well as usual,\xe2\x80\x99 she answers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd at the same time, like a crazy woman, she gives utterance to the\nsilliest remarks, to the most inexplicable explosions of spite.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes I am patient, but at other times I break out with anger.\nThen her own irritation is launched forth in a flood of insults, in\ncharges of imaginary crimes and all carried to the highest degree by\nsobs, tears, and retreats through the house to the most improbable\nspots. I go to look for her. I am ashamed before people, before the\nchildren, but there is nothing to be done. She is in a condition where\nI feel that she is ready for anything. I run, and finally find her.\nNights of torture follow, in which both of us, with exhausted nerves,\nappease each other, after the most cruel words and accusations.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, jealousy, causeless jealousy, is the condition of our debauched\nconjugal life. And throughout my marriage never did I cease to feel it\nand to suffer from it. There were two periods in which I suffered most\nintensely. The first time was after the birth of our first child, when\nthe doctors had forbidden my wife to nurse it. I was particularly\njealous, in the first place, because my wife felt that restlessness\npeculiar to animal matter when the regular course of life is\ninterrupted without occasion. But especially was I jealous because,\nhaving seen with what facility she had thrown off her moral duties as a\nmother, I concluded rightly, though unconsciously, that she would throw\noff as easily her conjugal duties, feeling all the surer of this\nbecause she was in perfect health, as was shown by the fact that, in\nspite of the prohibition of the dear doctors, she nursed her following\nchildren, and even very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see that you have no love for the doctors,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, having noticed\nPosdnicheff\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinarily spiteful expression of face and tone of\nvoice whenever he spoke of them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not a question of loving them or of not loving them. They have\nruined my life, as they have ruined the lives of thousands of beings\nbefore me, and I cannot help connecting the consequence with the cause.\nI conceive that they desire, like the lawyers and the rest, to make\nmoney. I would willingly have given them half of my income\xe2\x80\x94and any one\nwould have done it in my place, understanding what they do\xe2\x80\x94if they had\nconsented not to meddle in my conjugal life, and to keep themselves at\na distance. I have compiled no statistics, but I know scores of\ncases\xe2\x80\x94in reality, they are innumerable\xe2\x80\x94where they have killed, now a\nchild in its mother\xe2\x80\x99s womb, asserting positively that the mother could\nnot give birth to it (when the mother could give birth to it very\nwell), now mothers, under the pretext of a so-called operation. No one\nhas counted these murders, just as no one counted the murders of the\nInquisition, because it was supposed that they were committed for the\nbenefit of humanity. Innumerable are the crimes of the doctors! But all\nthese crimes are nothing compared with the materialistic demoralization\nwhich they introduce into the world through women. I say nothing of the\nfact that, if it were to follow their advice,\xe2\x80\x94thanks to the microbe\nwhich they see everywhere,\xe2\x80\x94humanity, instead of tending to union, would\nproceed straight to complete disunion. Everybody, according to their\ndoctrine, should isolate himself, and never remove from his mouth a\nsyringe filled with phenic acid (moreover, they have found out now that\nit does no good). But I would pass over all these things. The supreme\npoison is the perversion of people, especially of women. One can no\nlonger say now: \xe2\x80\x98You live badly, live better.\xe2\x80\x99 One can no longer say it\neither to himself or to others, for, if you live badly (say the\ndoctors), the cause is in the nervous system or in something similar,\nand it is necessary to go to consult them, and they will prescribe for\nyou thirty-five copecks\xe2\x80\x99 worth of remedies to be bought at the\ndrug-store, and you must swallow them. Your condition grows worse?\nAgain to the doctors, and more remedies! An excellent business!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut to return to our subject. I was saying that my wife nursed her\nchildren well, that the nursing and the gestation of the children, and\nthe children in general, quieted my tortures of jealousy, but that, on\nthe other hand, they provoked torments of a different sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe children came rapidly, one after another, and there happened what\nhappens in our society with children and doctors. Yes, children,\nmaternal love, it is a painful thing. Children, to a woman of our\nsociety, are not a joy, a pride, nor a fulfilment of her vocation, but\na cause of fear, anxiety, and interminable suffering, torture. Women\nsay it, they think it, and they feel it too. Children to them are\nreally a torture, not because they do not wish to give birth to them,\nnurse them, and care for them (women with a strong maternal\ninstinct\xe2\x80\x94and such was my wife\xe2\x80\x94are ready to do that), but because the\nchildren may fall sick and die. They do not wish to give birth to them,\nand then not love them; and when they love, they do not wish to feel\nfear for the child\xe2\x80\x99s health and life. That is why they do not wish to\nnurse them. \xe2\x80\x98If I nurse it,\xe2\x80\x99 they say, \xe2\x80\x98I shall become too fond of it.\xe2\x80\x99\nOne would think that they preferred india-rubber children, which could\nneither be sick nor die, and could always be repaired. What an\nentanglement in the brains of these poor women! Why such abominations\nto avoid pregnancy, and to avoid the love of the little ones?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove, the most joyous condition of the soul, is represented as a\ndanger. And why? Because, when a man does not live as a man, he is\nworse than a beast. A woman cannot look upon a child otherwise than as\na pleasure. It is true that it is painful to give birth to it, but what\nlittle hands! . . . Oh, the little hands! Oh, the little feet! Oh, its\nsmile! Oh, its little body! Oh, its prattle! Oh, its hiccough! In a\nword, it is a feeling of animal, sensual maternity. But as for any idea\nas to the mysterious significance of the appearance of a new human\nbeing to replace us, there is scarcely a sign of it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing of it appears in all that is said and done. No one has any\nfaith now in a baptism of the child, and yet that was nothing but a\nreminder of the human significance of the newborn babe.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have rejected all that, but they have not replaced it, and there\nremain only the dresses, the laces, the little hands, the little feet,\nand whatever exists in the animal. But the animal has neither\nimagination, nor foresight, nor reason, nor a doctor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! not even a doctor! The chicken droops its head, overwhelmed, or\nthe calf dies; the hen clucks and the cow lows for a time, and then\nthese beasts continue to live, forgetting what has happened.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith us, if the child falls sick, what is to be done, how to care for\nit, what doctor to call, where to go? If it dies, there will be no more\nlittle hands or little feet, and then what is the use of the sufferings\nendured? The cow does not ask all that, and this is why children are a\nsource of misery. The cow has no imagination, and for that reason\ncannot think how it might have saved the child if it had done this or\nthat, and its grief, founded in its physical being, lasts but a very\nshort time. It is only a condition, and not that sorrow which becomes\nexaggerated to the point of despair, thanks to idleness and satiety.\nThe cow has not that reasoning faculty which would enable it to ask the\nwhy. Why endure all these tortures? What was the use of so much love,\nif the little ones were to die? The cow has no logic which tells it to\nhave no more children, and, if any come accidentally, to neither love\nnor nurse them, that it may not suffer. But our wives reason, and\nreason in this way, and that is why I said that, when a man does not\nlive as a man, he is beneath the animal.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut then, how is it necessary to act, in your opinion, in order to\ntreat children humanly?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow? Why, love them humanly.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, do not mothers love their children?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey do not love them humanly, or very seldom do, and that is why they\ndo not love them even as dogs. Mark this, a hen, a goose, a wolf, will\nalways remain to woman inaccessible ideals of animal love. It is a rare\nthing for a woman to throw herself, at the peril of her life, upon an\nelephant to snatch her child away, whereas a hen or a sparrow will not\nfail to fly at a dog and sacrifice itself utterly for its children.\nObserve this, also. Woman has the power to limit her physical love for\nher children, which an animal cannot do. Does that mean that, because\nof this, woman is inferior to the animal? No. She is superior (and even\nto say superior is unjust, she is not superior, she is different), but\nshe has other duties, human duties. She can restrain herself in the\nmatter of animal love, and transfer her love to the soul of the child.\nThat is what woman\xe2\x80\x99s _r\xc3\xb4le_ should be, and that is precisely what we do\nnot see in our society. We read of the heroic acts of mothers who\nsacrifice their children in the name of a superior idea, and these\nthings seem to us like tales of the ancient world, which do not concern\nus. And yet I believe that, if the mother has not some ideal, in the\nname of which she can sacrifice the animal feeling, and if this force\nfinds no employment, she will transfer it to chimerical attempts to\nphysically preserve her child, aided in this task by the doctor, and\nshe will suffer as she does suffer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it was with my wife. Whether there was one child or five, the\nfeeling remained the same. In fact, it was a little better when there\nhad been five. Life was always poisoned with fear for the children, not\nonly from their real or imaginary diseases, but even by their simple\npresence. For my part, at least, throughout my conjugal life, all my\ninterests and all my happiness depended upon the health of my children,\ntheir condition, their studies. Children, it is needless to say, are a\nserious consideration; but all ought to live, and in our days parents\ncan no longer live. Regular life does not exist for them. The whole\nlife of the family hangs by a hair. What a terrible thing it is to\nsuddenly receive the news that little Basile is vomiting, or that Lise\nhas a cramp in the stomach! Immediately you abandon everything, you\nforget everything, everything becomes nothing. The essential thing is\nthe doctor, the enema, the temperature. You cannot begin a conversation\nbut little Pierre comes running in with an anxious air to ask if he may\neat an apple, or what jacket he shall put on, or else it is the servant\nwho enters with a screaming baby.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRegular, steady family life does not exist. Where you live, and\nconsequently what you do, depends upon the health of the little ones,\nthe health of the little ones depends upon nobody, and, thanks to the\ndoctors, who pretend to aid health, your entire life is disturbed. It\nis a perpetual peril. Scarcely do we believe ourselves out of it when a\nnew danger comes: more attempts to save. Always the situation of\nsailors on a foundering vessel. Sometimes it seemed to me that this was\ndone on purpose, that my wife feigned anxiety in order to conquer me,\nsince that solved the question so simply for her benefit. It seemed to\nme that all that she did at those times was done for its effect upon\nme, but now I see that she herself, my wife, suffered and was tortured\non account of the little ones, their health, and their diseases.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA torture to both of us, but to her the children were also a means of\nforgetting herself, like an intoxication. I often noticed, when she was\nvery sad, that she was relieved, when a child fell sick, at being able\nto take refuge in this intoxication. It was involuntary intoxication,\nbecause as yet there was nothing else. On every side we heard that Mrs.\nSo-and-so had lost children, that Dr. So-and-so had saved the child of\nMrs. So-and-so, and that in a certain family all had moved from the\nhouse in which they were living, and thereby saved the little ones. And\nthe doctors, with a serious air, confirmed this, sustaining my wife in\nher opinions. She was not prone to fear, but the doctor dropped some\nword, like corruption of the blood, scarlatina, or else\xe2\x80\x94heaven help\nus\xe2\x80\x94diphtheria, and off she went.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was impossible for it to be otherwise. Women in the old days had\nthe belief that \xe2\x80\x98God has given, God has taken away,\xe2\x80\x99 that the soul of\nthe little angel is going to heaven, and that it is better to die\ninnocent than to die in sin. If the women of to-day had something like\nthis faith, they could endure more peacefully the sickness of their\nchildren. But of all that there does not remain even a trace. And yet\nit is necessary to believe in something; consequently they stupidly\nbelieve in medicine, and not even in medicine, but in the doctor. One\nbelieves in X, another in Z, and, like all believers, they do not see\nthe idiocy of their beliefs. They believe _quia absurdum_, because, in\nreality, if they did not believe in a stupid way, they would see the\nvanity of all that these brigands prescribe for them. Scarlatina is a\ncontagious disease; so, when one lives in a large city, half the family\nhas to move away from its residence (we did it twice), and yet every\nman in the city is a centre through which pass innumerable diameters,\ncarrying threads of all sorts of contagions. There is no obstacle: the\nbaker, the tailor, the coachman, the laundresses.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I would undertake, for every man who moves on account of\ncontagion, to find in his new dwelling-place another contagion similar,\nif not the same.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that is not all. Every one knows rich people who, after a case of\ndiphtheria, destroy everything in their residences, and then fall sick\nin houses newly built and furnished. Every one knows, likewise, numbers\nof men who come in contact with sick people and do not get infected.\nOur anxieties are due to the people who circulate tall stories. One\nwoman says that she has an excellent doctor. \xe2\x80\x98Pardon me,\xe2\x80\x99 answers the\nother, \xe2\x80\x98he killed such a one,\xe2\x80\x99 or such a one. And _vice versa_. Bring\nher another, who knows no more, who learned from the same books, who\ntreats according to the same formulas, but who goes about in a\ncarriage, and asks a hundred roubles a visit, and she will have faith\nin him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt all lies in the fact that our women are savages. They have no\nbelief in God, but some of them believe in the evil eye, and the others\nin doctors who charge high fees. If they had faith they would know that\nscarlatina, diphtheria, etc., are not so terrible, since they cannot\ndisturb that which man can and should love,\xe2\x80\x94the soul. There can result\nfrom them only that which none of us can avoid,\xe2\x80\x94disease and death.\nWithout faith in God, they love only physically, and all their energy\nis concentrated upon the preservation of life, which cannot be\npreserved, and which the doctors promise the fools of both sexes to\nsave. And from that time there is nothing to be done; the doctors must\nbe summoned.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus the presence of the children not only did not improve our\nrelations as husband and wife, but, on the contrary, disunited us. The\nchildren became an additional cause of dispute, and the larger they\ngrew, the more they became an instrument of struggle.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne would have said that we used them as weapons with which to combat\neach other. Each of us had his favorite. I made use of little Basile\n(the eldest), she of Lise. Further, when the children reached an age\nwhere their characters began to be defined, they became allies, which\nwe drew each in his or her own direction. They suffered horribly from\nthis, the poor things, but we, in our perpetual hubbub, were not\nclear-headed enough to think of them. The little girl was devoted to\nme, but the eldest boy, who resembled my wife, his favorite, often\ninspired me with dislike.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe lived at first in the country, then in the city, and, if the final\nmisfortune had not happened, I should have lived thus until my old age\nand should then have believed that I had had a good life,\xe2\x80\x94not too good,\nbut, on the other hand, not bad,\xe2\x80\x94an existence such as other people\nlead. I should not have understood the abyss of misfortune and ignoble\nfalsehood in which I floundered about, feeling that something was not\nright. I felt, in the first place, that I, a man, who, according to my\nideas, ought to be the master, wore the petticoats, and that I could\nnot get rid of them. The principal cause of my subjection was the\nchildren. I should have liked to free myself, but I could not. Bringing\nup the children, and resting upon them, my wife ruled. I did not then\nrealize that she could not help ruling, especially because, in\nmarrying, she was morally superior to me, as every young girl is\nincomparably superior to the man, since she is incomparably purer.\nStrange thing! The ordinary wife in our society is a very commonplace\nperson or worse, selfish, gossiping, whimsical, whereas the ordinary\nyoung girl, until the age of twenty, is a charming being, ready for\neverything that is beautiful and lofty. Why is this so? Evidently\nbecause husbands pervert them, and lower them to their own level.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn truth, if boys and girls are born equal, the little girls find\nthemselves in a better situation. In the first place, the young girl is\nnot subjected to the perverting conditions to which we are subjected.\nShe has neither cigarettes, nor wine, nor cards, nor comrades, nor\npublic houses, nor public functions. And then the chief thing is that\nshe is physically pure, and that is why, in marrying, she is superior\nto her husband. She is superior to man as a young girl, and when she\nbecomes a wife in our society, where there is no need to work in order\nto live, she becomes superior, also, by the gravity of the acts of\ngeneration, birth, and nursing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWoman, in bringing a child into the world, and giving it her bosom,\nsees clearly that her affair is more serious than the affair of man,\nwho sits in the Zemstvo, in the court. She knows that in these\nfunctions the main thing is money, and money can be made in different\nways, and for that very reason money is not inevitably necessary, like\nnursing a child. Consequently woman is necessarily superior to man, and\nmust rule. But man, in our society, not only does not recognize this,\nbut, on the contrary, always looks upon her from the height of his\ngrandeur, despising what she does.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus my wife despised me for my work at the Zemstvo, because she gave\nbirth to children and nursed them. I, in turn, thought that woman\xe2\x80\x99s\nlabor was most contemptible, which one might and should laugh at.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cApart from the other motives, we were also separated by a mutual\ncontempt. Our relations grew ever more hostile, and we arrived at that\nperiod when, not only did dissent provoke hostility, but hostility\nprovoked dissent. Whatever she might say, I was sure in advance to hold\na contrary opinion; and she the same. Toward the fourth year of our\nmarriage it was tacitly decided between us that no intellectual\ncommunity was possible, and we made no further attempts at it. As to\nthe simplest objects, we each held obstinately to our own opinions.\nWith strangers we talked upon the most varied and most intimate\nmatters, but not with each other. Sometimes, in listening to my wife\ntalk with others in my presence, I said to myself: \xe2\x80\x98What a woman!\nEverything that she says is a lie!\xe2\x80\x99 And I was astonished that the\nperson with whom she was conversing did not see that she was lying.\nWhen we were together; we were condemned to silence, or to\nconversations which, I am sure, might have been carried on by animals.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What time is it? It is bed-time. What is there for dinner to-day?\nWhere shall we go? What is there in the newspaper? The doctor must be\nsent for, Lise has a sore throat.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnless we kept within the extremely narrow limits of such\nconversation, irritation was sure to ensue. The presence of a third\nperson relieved us, for through an intermediary we could still\ncommunicate. She probably believed that she was always right. As for\nme, in my own eyes, I was a saint beside her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe periods of what we call love arrived as often as formerly. They\nwere more brutal, without refinement, without ornament; but they were\nshort, and generally followed by periods of irritation without cause,\nirritation fed by the most trivial pretexts. We had spats about the\ncoffee, the table-cloth, the carriage, games of cards,\xe2\x80\x94trifles, in\nshort, which could not be of the least importance to either of us. As\nfor me, a terrible execration was continually boiling up within me. I\nwatched her pour the tea, swing her foot, lift her spoon to her mouth,\nand blow upon hot liquids or sip them, and I detested her as if these\nhad been so many crimes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not notice that these periods of irritation depended very\nregularly upon the periods of love. Each of the latter was followed by\none of the former. A period of intense love was followed by a long\nperiod of anger; a period of mild love induced a mild irritation. We\ndid not understand that this love and this hatred were two opposite\nfaces of the same animal feeling. To live thus would be terrible, if\none understood the philosophy of it. But we did not perceive this, we\ndid not analyze it. It is at once the torture and the relief of man\nthat, when he lives irregularly, he can cherish illusions as to the\nmiseries of his situation. So did we. She tried to forget herself in\nsudden and absorbing occupations, in household duties, the care of the\nfurniture, her dress and that of her children, in the education of the\nlatter, and in looking after their health. These were occupations that\ndid not arise from any immediate necessity, but she accomplished them\nas if her life and that of her children depended on whether the pastry\nwas allowed to burn, whether a curtain was hanging properly, whether a\ndress was a success, whether a lesson was well learned, or whether a\nmedicine was swallowed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw clearly that to her all this was, more than anything else, a\nmeans of forgetting, an intoxication, just as hunting, card-playing,\nand my functions at the Zemstvo served the same purpose for me. It is\ntrue that in addition I had an intoxication literally\nspeaking,\xe2\x80\x94tobacco, which I smoked in large quantities, and wine, upon\nwhich I did not get drunk, but of which I took too much. Vodka before\nmeals, and during meals two glasses of wine, so that a perpetual mist\nconcealed the turmoil of existence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese new theories of hypnotism, of mental maladies, of hysteria are\nnot simple stupidities, but dangerous or evil stupidities. Charcot, I\nam sure, would have said that my wife was hysterical, and of me he\nwould have said that I was an abnormal being, and he would have wanted\nto treat me. But in us there was nothing requiring treatment. All this\nmental malady was the simple result of the fact that we were living\nimmorally. Thanks to this immoral life, we suffered, and, to stifle our\nsufferings, we tried abnormal means, which the doctors call the\n\xe2\x80\x98symptoms\xe2\x80\x99 of a mental malady,\xe2\x80\x94_hysteria_.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was no occasion in all this to apply for treatment to Charcot or\nto anybody else. Neither suggestion nor bromide would have been\neffective in working our cure. The needful thing was an examination of\nthe origin of the evil. It is as when one is sitting on a nail; if you\nsee the nail, you see that which is irregular in your life, and you\navoid it. Then the pain stops, without any necessity of stifling it.\nOur pain arose from the irregularity of our life, and also my jealousy,\nmy irritability, and the necessity of keeping myself in a state of\nperpetual semi-intoxication by hunting, card-playing, and, above all,\nthe use of wine and tobacco. It was because of this irregularity that\nmy wife so passionately pursued her occupations. The sudden changes of\nher disposition, from extreme sadness to extreme gayety, and her\nbabble, arose from the need of forgetting herself, of forgetting her\nlife, in the continual intoxication of varied and very brief\noccupations.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus we lived in a perpetual fog, in which we did not distinguish our\ncondition. We were like two galley-slaves fastened to the same ball,\ncursing each other, poisoning each other\xe2\x80\x99s existence, and trying to\nshake each other off. I was still unaware that ninety-nine families out\nof every hundred live in the same hell, and that it cannot be\notherwise. I had not learned this fact from others or from myself. The\ncoincidences that are met in regular, and even in irregular life, are\nsurprising. At the very period when the life of parents becomes\nimpossible, it becomes indispensable that they go to the city to live,\nin order to educate their children. That is what we did.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPosdnicheff became silent, and twice there escaped him, in the\nhalf-darkness, sighs, which at that moment seemed to me like suppressed\nsobs. Then he continued.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo we lived in the city. In the city the wretched feel less sad. One\ncan live there a hundred years without being noticed, and be dead a\nlong time before anybody will notice it. People have no time to inquire\ninto your life. All are absorbed. Business, social relations, art, the\nhealth of children, their education. And there are visits that must be\nreceived and made; it is necessary to see this one, it is necessary to\nhear that one or the other one. In the city there are always one, two,\nor three celebrities that it is indispensable that one should visit.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow one must care for himself, or care for such or such a little one,\nnow it is the professor, the private tutor, the governesses, . . . and\nlife is absolutely empty. In this activity we were less conscious of\nthe sufferings of our cohabitation. Moreover, in the first of it, we\nhad a superb occupation,\xe2\x80\x94the arrangement of the new dwelling, and then,\ntoo, the moving from the city to the country, and from the country to\nthe city.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus we spent a winter. The following winter an incident happened to\nus which passed unnoticed, but which was the fundamental cause of all\nthat happened later. My wife was suffering, and the rascals (the\ndoctors) would not permit her to conceive a child, and taught her how\nto avoid it. I was profoundly disgusted. I struggled vainly against it,\nbut she insisted frivolously and obstinately, and I surrendered. The\nlast justification of our life as wretches was thereby suppressed, and\nlife became baser than ever.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe peasant and the workingman need children, and hence their conjugal\nrelations have a justification. But we, when we have a few children,\nhave no need of any more. They make a superfluous confusion of expenses\nand joint heirs, and are an embarrassment. Consequently we have no\nexcuses for our existence as wretches, but we are so deeply degraded\nthat we do not see the necessity of a justification. The majority of\npeople in contemporary society give themselves up to this debauchery\nwithout the slightest remorse. We have no conscience left, except, so\nto speak, the conscience of public opinion and of the criminal code.\nBut in this matter neither of these consciences is struck. There is not\na being in society who blushes at it. Each one practices it,\xe2\x80\x94X, Y, Z,\netc. What is the use of multiplying beggars, and depriving ourselves of\nthe joys of social life? There is no necessity of having conscience\nbefore the criminal code, or of fearing it: low girls, soldiers\xe2\x80\x99 wives\nwho throw their children into ponds or wells, these certainly must be\nput in prison. But with us the suppression is effected opportunely and\nproperly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus we passed two years more. The method prescribed by the rascals\nhad evidently succeeded. My wife had grown stouter and handsomer. It\nwas the beauty of the end of summer. She felt it, and paid much\nattention to her person. She had acquired that provoking beauty that\nstirs men. She was in all the brilliancy of the wife of thirty years,\nwho conceives no children, eats heartily, and is excited. The very\nsight of her was enough to frighten one. She was like a spirited\ncarriage-horse that has long been idle, and suddenly finds itself\nwithout a bridle. As for my wife, she had no bridle, as for that\nmatter, ninety-nine hundredths of our women have none.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\n\nPosdnicheff\xe2\x80\x99s face had become transformed; his eyes were pitiable;\ntheir expression seemed strange, like that of another being than\nhimself; his moustache and beard turned up toward the top of his face;\nhis nose was diminished, and his mouth enlarged, immense, frightful.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed \xe2\x80\x9cshe had grown stouter since ceasing to conceive, and\nher anxieties about her children began to disappear. Not even to\ndisappear. One would have said that she was waking from a long\nintoxication, that on coming to herself she had perceived the entire\nuniverse with its joys, a whole world in which she had not learned to\nlive, and which she did not understand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98If only this world shall not vanish! When time is past, when old age\ncomes, one cannot recover it.\xe2\x80\x99 Thus, I believe, she thought, or rather\nfelt. Moreover, she could neither think nor feel otherwise. She had\nbeen brought up in this idea that there is in the world but one thing\nworthy of attention,\xe2\x80\x94love. In marrying, she had known something of this\nlove, but very far from everything that she had understood as promised\nher, everything that she expected. How many disillusions! How much\nsuffering! And an unexpected torture,\xe2\x80\x94the children! This torture had\ntold upon her, and then, thanks to the obliging doctor, she had learned\nthat it is possible to avoid having children. That had made her glad.\nShe had tried, and she was now revived for the only thing that she\nknew,\xe2\x80\x94for love. But love with a husband polluted by jealousy and\nill-nature was no longer her ideal. She began to think of some other\ntenderness; at least, that is what I thought. She looked about her as\nif expecting some event or some being. I noticed it, and I could not\nhelp being anxious.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways, now, it happened that, in talking with me through a third\nparty (that is, in talking with others, but with the intention that I\nshould hear), she boldly expressed,\xe2\x80\x94not thinking that an hour before\nshe had said the opposite,\xe2\x80\x94half joking, half seriously, this idea that\nmaternal anxieties are a delusion; that it is not worth while to\nsacrifice one\xe2\x80\x99s life to children. When one is young, it is necessary to\nenjoy life. So she occupied herself less with the children, not with\nthe same intensity as formerly, and paid more and more attention to\nherself, to her face,\xe2\x80\x94although she concealed it,\xe2\x80\x94to her pleasures, and\neven to her perfection from the worldly point of view. She began to\ndevote herself passionately to the piano, which had formerly stood\nforgotten in the corner. There, at the piano, began the adventure.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe _man_ appeared.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPosdnicheff seemed embarrassed, and twice again there escaped him that\nnasal sound of which I spoke above. I thought that it gave him pain to\nrefer to the _man_, and to remember him. He made an effort, as if to\nbreak down the obstacle that embarrassed him, and continued with\ndetermination.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was a bad man in my eyes, and not because he has played such an\nimportant _r\xc3\xb4le_ in my life, but because he was really such. For the\nrest, from the fact that he was bad, we must conclude that he was\nirresponsible. He was a musician, a violinist. Not a professional\nmusician, but half man of the world, half artist. His father, a country\nproprietor, was a neighbor of my father\xe2\x80\x99s. The father had become\nruined, and the children, three boys, were all sent away. Our man, the\nyoungest, was sent to his godmother at Paris. There they placed him in\nthe Conservatory, for he showed a taste for music. He came out a\nviolinist, and played in concerts.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOn the point of speaking evil of the other, Posdnicheff checked\nhimself, stopped, and said suddenly:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn truth, I know not how he lived. I only know that that year he came\nto Russia, and came to see me. Moist eyes of almond shape, smiling red\nlips, a little moustache well waxed, hair brushed in the latest\nfashion, a vulgarly pretty face,\xe2\x80\x94what the women call \xe2\x80\x98not bad,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94feebly\nbuilt physically, but with no deformity; with hips as broad as a\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s; correct, and insinuating himself into the familiarity of\npeople as far as possible, but having that keen sense that quickly\ndetects a false step and retires in reason,\xe2\x80\x94a man, in short, observant\nof the external rules of dignity, with that special Parisianism that is\nrevealed in buttoned boots, a gaudy cravat, and that something which\nforeigners pick up in Paris, and which, in its peculiarity and novelty,\nalways has an influence on our women. In his manners an external and\nartificial gayety, a way, you know, of referring to everything by\nhints, by unfinished fragments, as if everything that one says you knew\nalready, recalled it, and could supply the omissions. Well, he, with\nhis music, was the cause of all.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the trial the affair was so represented that everything seemed\nattributable to jealousy. It is false,\xe2\x80\x94that is, not quite false, but\nthere was something else. The verdict was rendered that I was a\ndeceived husband, that I had killed in defence of my sullied honor\n(that is the way they put it in their language), and thus I was\nacquitted. I tried to explain the affair from my own point of view, but\nthey concluded that I simply wanted to rehabilitate the memory of my\nwife. Her relations with the musician, whatever they may have been, are\nnow of no importance to me or to her. The important part is what I have\ntold you. The whole tragedy was due to the fact that this man came into\nour house at a time when an immense abyss had already been dug between\nus, that frightful tension of mutual hatred, in which the slightest\nmotive sufficed to precipitate the crisis. Our quarrels in the last\ndays were something terrible, and the more astonishing because they\nwere followed by a brutal passion extremely strained. If it had not\nbeen he, some other would have come. If the pretext had not been\njealousy, I should have discovered another. I insist upon this\npoint,\xe2\x80\x94that all husbands who live the married life that I lived must\neither resort to outside debauchery, or separate from their wives, or\nkill themselves, or kill their wives as I did. If there is any one in\nmy case to whom this does not happen, he is a very rare exception, for,\nbefore ending as I ended, I was several times on the point of suicide,\nand my wife made several attempts to poison herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn order that you may understand me, I must tell you how this\nhappened. We were living along, and all seemed well. Suddenly we began\nto talk of the children\xe2\x80\x99s education. I do not remember what words\neither of us uttered, but a discussion began, reproaches, leaps from\none subject to another. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, I know it. It has been so for a long\ntime.\xe2\x80\x99 . . . \xe2\x80\x98You said that.\xe2\x80\x99 . . . \xe2\x80\x98No, I did not say that.\xe2\x80\x99 . . .\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I lie?\xe2\x80\x99 etc.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I felt that the frightful crisis was approaching when I should\ndesire to kill her or else myself. I knew that it was approaching; I\nwas afraid of it as of fire; I wanted to restrain myself. But rage took\npossession of my whole being. My wife found herself in the same\ncondition, perhaps worse. She knew that she intentionally distorted\neach of my words, and each of her words was saturated with venom. All\nthat was dear to me she disparaged and profaned. The farther the\nquarrel went, the more furious it became. I cried, \xe2\x80\x98Be silent,\xe2\x80\x99 or\nsomething like that.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe bounded out of the room and ran toward the children. I tried to\nhold her back to finish my insults. I grasped her by the arm, and hurt\nher. She cried: \xe2\x80\x98Children, your father is beating me.\xe2\x80\x99 I cried: \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t\nlie.\xe2\x80\x99 She continued to utter falsehoods for the simple purpose of\nirritating me further. \xe2\x80\x98Ah, it is not the first time,\xe2\x80\x99 or something of\nthat sort. The children rushed toward her and tried to quiet her. I\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t sham.\xe2\x80\x99 She said: \xe2\x80\x98You look upon everything as a sham. You\nwould kill a person and say he was shamming. Now I understand you. That\nis what you want to do.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Oh, if you were only dead!\xe2\x80\x99 I cried.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember how that terrible phrase frightened me. Never had I thought\nthat I could utter words so brutal, so frightful, and I was stupefied\nat what had just escaped my lips. I fled into my private apartment. I\nsat down and began to smoke. I heard her go into the hall and prepare\nto go out. I asked her: \xe2\x80\x98Where are you going? She did not answer.\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, may the devil take you!\xe2\x80\x99 said I to myself, going back into my\nprivate room, where I lay down again and began smoking afresh.\nThousands of plans of vengeance, of ways of getting rid of her, and how\nto arrange this, and act as if nothing had happened,\xe2\x80\x94all this passed\nthrough my head. I thought of these things, and I smoked, and smoked,\nand smoked. I thought of running away, of making my escape, of going to\nAmerica. I went so far as to dream how beautiful it would be, after\ngetting rid of her, to love another woman, entirely different from her.\nI should be rid of her if she should die or if I should get a divorce,\nand I tried to think how that could be managed. I saw that I was\ngetting confused, but, in order not to see that I was not thinking\nrightly, I kept on smoking.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the life of the house went on as usual. The children\xe2\x80\x99s teacher\ncame and asked: \xe2\x80\x98Where is Madame? When will she return?\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe servants asked if they should serve the tea. I entered the\ndining-room. The children, Lise, the eldest girl, looked at me with\nfright, as if to question me, and she did not come. The whole evening\npassed, and still she did not come. Two sentiments kept succeeding each\nother in my soul,\xe2\x80\x94hatred of her, since she tortured myself and the\nchildren by her absence, but would finally return just the same, and\nfear lest she might return and make some attempt upon herself. But\nwhere should I look for her? At her sister\xe2\x80\x99s? It seemed so stupid to go\nto ask where one\xe2\x80\x99s wife is. Moreover, may God forbid, I hoped, that she\nshould be at her sister\xe2\x80\x99s! If she wishes to torment any one, let her\ntorment herself first. And suppose she were not at her sister\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose she were to do, or had already done, something.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, midnight, one o\xe2\x80\x99clock. . . . I did not sleep. I did\nnot go to my chamber. It is stupid to lie stretched out all alone, and\nto wait. But in my study I did not rest. I tried to busy myself, to\nwrite letters, to read. Impossible! I was alone, tortured, wicked, and\nI listened. Toward daylight I went to sleep. I awoke. She had not\nreturned. Everything in the house went on as usual, and all looked at\nme in astonishment, questioningly. The children\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were full of\nreproach for me.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd always the same feeling of anxiety about her, and of hatred\nbecause of this anxiety.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cToward eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning came her sister, her\nambassadress. Then began the usual phrases: \xe2\x80\x98She is in a terrible\nstate. What is the matter?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Why, nothing has happened.\xe2\x80\x99 I spoke of her\nasperity of character, and I added that I had done nothing, and that I\nwould not take the first step. If she wants a divorce, so much the\nbetter! My sister-in-law would not listen to this idea, and went away\nwithout having gained anything. I was obstinate, and I said boldly and\ndeterminedly, in talking to her, that I would not take the first step.\nImmediately she had gone I went into the other room, and saw the\nchildren in a frightened and pitiful state, and there I found myself\nalready inclined to take this first step. But I was bound by my word.\nAgain I walked up and down, always smoking. At breakfast I drank brandy\nand wine, and I reached the point which I unconsciously desired, the\npoint where I no longer saw the stupidity and baseness of my situation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cToward three o\xe2\x80\x99clock she came. I thought that she was appeased, or\nadmitted her defeat. I began to tell her that I was provoked by her\nreproaches. She answered me, with the same severe and terribly downcast\nface, that she had not come for explanations, but to take the children,\nthat we could not live together. I answered that it was not my fault,\nthat she had put me beside myself. She looked at me with a severe and\nsolemn air, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Say no more. You will repent it.\xe2\x80\x99 I said that I\ncould not tolerate comedies. Then she cried out something that I did\nnot understand, and rushed toward her room. The key turned in the lock,\nand she shut herself up. I pushed at the door. There was no response.\nFurious, I went away.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA half hour later Lise came running all in tears. \xe2\x80\x98What! Has anything\nhappened? We cannot hear Mamma!\xe2\x80\x99 We went toward my wife\xe2\x80\x99s room. I\npushed the door with all my might. The bolt was scarcely drawn, and the\ndoor opened. In a skirt, with high boots, my wife lay awkwardly on the\nbed. On the table an empty opium phial. We restored her to life. Tears\nand then reconciliation! Not reconciliation; internally each kept the\nhatred for the other, but it was absolutely necessary for the moment to\nend the scene in some way, and life began again as before. These\nscenes, and even worse, came now once a week, now every month, now\nevery day. And invariably the same incidents. Once I was absolutely\nresolved to fly, but through some inconceivable weakness I remained.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch were the circumstances in which we were living when the _man_\ncame. The man was bad, it is true. But what! No worse than we were.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we moved to Moscow, this gentleman\xe2\x80\x94his name was\nTroukhatchevsky\xe2\x80\x94came to my house. It was in the morning. I received\nhim. In former times we had been very familiar. He tried, by various\nadvances, to re-establish the familiarity, but I was determined to keep\nhim at a distance, and soon he gave it up. He displeased me extremely.\nAt the first glance I saw that he was a filthy _d\xc3\xa9bauch\xc3\xa9_. I was\njealous of him, even before he had seen my wife. But, strange thing!\nsome occult fatal power kept me from repulsing him and sending him\naway, and, on the contrary, induced me to suffer this approach. What\ncould have been simpler than to talk with him a few minutes, and then\ndismiss him coldly without introducing him to my wife? But no, as if on\npurpose, I turned the conversation upon his skill as a violinist, and\nhe answered that, contrary to what I had heard, he now played the\nviolin more than formerly. He remembered that I used to play. I\nanswered that I had abandoned music, but that my wife played very well.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSingular thing! Why, in the important events of our life, in those in\nwhich a man\xe2\x80\x99s fate is decided,\xe2\x80\x94as mine was decided in that moment,\xe2\x80\x94why\nin these events is there neither a past nor a future? My relations with\nTroukhatchevsky the first day, at the first hour, were such as they\nmight still have been after all that has happened. I was conscious that\nsome frightful misfortune must result from the presence of this man,\nand, in spite of that, I could not help being amiable to him. I\nintroduced him to my wife. She was pleased with him. In the beginning,\nI suppose, because of the pleasure of the violin playing, which she\nadored. She had even hired for that purpose a violinist from the\ntheatre. But when she cast a glance at me, she understood my feelings,\nand concealed her impression. Then began the mutual trickery and\ndeceit. I smiled agreeably, pretending that all this pleased me\nextremely. He, looking at my wife, as all _d\xc3\xa9bauch\xc3\xa9s_ look at beautiful\nwomen, with an air of being interested solely in the subject of\nconversation,\xe2\x80\x94that is, in that which did not interest him at all.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe tried to seem indifferent. But my expression, my jealous or false\nsmile, which she knew so well, and the voluptuous glances of the\nmusician, evidently excited her. I saw that, after the first interview,\nher eyes were already glittering, glittering strangely, and that,\nthanks to my jealousy, between him and her had been immediately\nestablished that sort of electric current which is provoked by an\nidentity of expression in the smile and in the eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe talked, at the first interview, of music, of Paris, and of all\nsorts of trivialities. He rose to go. Pressing his hat against his\nswaying hip, he stood erect, looking now at her and now at me, as if\nwaiting to see what she would do. I remember that minute, precisely\nbecause it was in my power not to invite him. I need not have invited\nhim, and then nothing would have happened. But I cast a glance first at\nhim, then at her. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t flatter yourself that I can be jealous of\nyou,\xe2\x80\x99 I thought, addressing myself to her mentally, and I invited the\nother to bring his violin that very evening, and to play with my wife.\nShe raised her eyes toward me with astonishment, and her face turned\npurple, as if she were seized with a sudden fear. She began to excuse\nherself, saying that she did not play well enough. This refusal only\nexcited me the more. I remember the strange feeling with which I looked\nat his neck, his white neck, in contrast with his black hair, separated\nby a parting, when, with his skipping gait, like that of a bird, he\nleft my house. I could not help confessing to myself that this man\xe2\x80\x99s\npresence caused me suffering. \xe2\x80\x98It is in my power,\xe2\x80\x99 thought I, \xe2\x80\x98to so\narrange things that I shall never see him again. But can it be that I,\n_I_, fear him? No, I do not fear him. It would be too humiliating!\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there in the hall, knowing that my wife heard me, I insisted that\nhe should come that very evening with his violin. He promised me, and\nwent away. In the evening he arrived with his violin, and they played\ntogether. But for a long time things did not go well; we had not the\nnecessary music, and that which we had my wife could not play at sight.\nI amused myself with their difficulties. I aided them, I made\nproposals, and they finally executed a few pieces,\xe2\x80\x94songs without words,\nand a little sonata by Mozart. He played in a marvellous manner. He had\nwhat is called the energetic and tender tone. As for difficulties,\nthere were none for him. Scarcely had he begun to play, when his face\nchanged. He became serious, and much more sympathetic. He was, it is\nneedless to say, much stronger than my wife. He helped her, he advised\nher simply and naturally, and at the same time played his game with\ncourtesy. My wife seemed interested only in the music. She was very\nsimple and agreeable. Throughout the evening I feigned, not only for\nthe others, but for myself, an interest solely in the music. Really, I\nwas continually tortured by jealousy. From the first minute that the\nmusician\xe2\x80\x99s eyes met those of my wife, I saw that he did not regard her\nas a disagreeable woman, with whom on occasion it would be unpleasant\nto enter into intimate relations.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had been pure, I should not have dreamed of what he might think\nof her. But I looked at women, and that is why I understood him and was\nin torture. I was in torture, especially because I was sure that toward\nme she had no other feeling than of perpetual irritation, sometimes\ninterrupted by the customary sensuality, and that this man,\xe2\x80\x94thanks to\nhis external elegance and his novelty, and, above all, thanks to his\nunquestionably remarkable talent, thanks to the attraction exercised\nunder the influence of music, thanks to the impression that music\nproduces upon nervous natures,\xe2\x80\x94this man would not only please, but\nwould inevitably, and without difficulty, subjugate and conquer her,\nand do with her as he liked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could not help seeing this. I could not help suffering, or keep from\nbeing jealous. And I was jealous, and I suffered, and in spite of that,\nand perhaps even because of that, an unknown force, in spite of my\nwill, impelled me to be not only polite, but more than polite, amiable.\nI cannot say whether I did it for my wife, or to show him that I did\nnot fear _him_, or to deceive myself; but from my first relations with\nhim I could not be at my ease. I was obliged, that I might not give way\nto a desire to kill him immediately, to \xe2\x80\x98caress\xe2\x80\x99 him. I filled his\nglass at the table, I grew enthusiastic over his playing, I talked to\nhim with an extremely amiable smile, and I invited him to dinner the\nfollowing Sunday, and to play again. I told him that I would invite\nsome of my acquaintances, lovers of his art, to hear him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo or three days later I was entering my house, in conversation with\na friend, when in the hall I suddenly felt something as heavy as a\nstone weighing on my heart, and I could not account for it. And it was\nthis, it was this: in passing through the hall, I had noticed something\nwhich reminded me of _him_. Not until I reached my study did I realize\nwhat it was, and I returned to the hall to verify my conjecture. Yes, I\nwas not mistaken. It was his overcoat (everything that belonged to him,\nI, without realizing it, had observed with extraordinary attention). I\nquestioned the servant. That was it. He had come. \xe2\x80\x9cI passed near the\nparlor, through my children\xe2\x80\x99s study-room. Lise, my daughter, was\nsitting before a book, and the old nurse, with my youngest child, was\nbeside the table, turning the cover of something or other. In the\nparlor I heard a slow _arpeggio_, and his voice, deadened, and a denial\nfrom her. She said: \xe2\x80\x98No, no! There is something else!\xe2\x80\x99 And it seemed to\nme that some one was purposely deadening the words by the aid of the\npiano.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God! How my heart leaped! What were my imaginations! When I\nremember the beast that lived in me at that moment, I am seized with\nfright. My heart was first compressed, then stopped, and then began to\nbeat like a hammer. The principal feeling, as in every bad feeling, was\npity for myself. \xe2\x80\x98Before the children, before the old nurse,\xe2\x80\x99 thought\nI, \xe2\x80\x98she dishonors me. I will go away. I can endure it no longer. God\nknows what I should do if. . . . But I must go in.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old nurse raised her eyes to mine, as if she understood, and\nadvised me to keep a sharp watch. \xe2\x80\x98I must go in,\xe2\x80\x99 I said to myself,\nand, without knowing what I did, I opened the door. He was sitting at\nthe piano and making _arpeggios_ with his long, white, curved fingers.\nShe was standing in the angle of the grand piano, before the open\nscore. She saw or heard me first, and raised her eyes to mine. Was she\nstunned, was she pretending not to be frightened, or was she really not\nfrightened at all? In any case, she did not tremble, she did not stir.\nShe blushed, but only a little later.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98How glad I am that you have come! We have not decided what we will\nplay Sunday,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, in a tone that she would not have had if she\nhad been alone with me.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis tone, and the way in which she said \xe2\x80\x98we\xe2\x80\x99 in speaking of herself\nand of him, revolted me. I saluted him silently. He shook hands with me\ndirectly, with a smile that seemed to me full of mockery. He explained\nto me that he had brought some scores, in order to prepare for the\nSunday concert, and that they were not in accord as to the piece to\nchoose,\xe2\x80\x94whether difficult, classic things, notably a sonata by\nBeethoven, or lighter pieces.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd as he spoke, he looked at me. It was all so natural, so simple,\nthat there was absolutely nothing to be said against it. And at the\nsame time I saw, I was sure, that it was false, that they were in a\nconspiracy to deceive me.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the most torturing situations for the jealous (and in our\nsocial life everybody is jealous) are those social conditions which\nallow a very great and dangerous intimacy between a man and a woman\nunder certain pretexts. One must make himself the laughing stock of\neverybody, if he desires to prevent associations in the ball-room, the\nintimacy of doctors with their patients, the familiarity of art\noccupations, and especially of music. In order that people may occupy\nthemselves together with the noblest art, music, a certain intimacy is\nnecessary, in which there is nothing blameworthy. Only a jealous fool\nof a husband can have anything to say against it. A husband should not\nhave such thoughts, and especially should not thrust his nose into\nthese affairs, or prevent them. And yet, everybody knows that precisely\nin these occupations, especially in music, many adulteries originate in\nour society.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had evidently embarrassed them, because for some time I was unable\nto say anything. I was like a bottle suddenly turned upside down, from\nwhich the water does not run because it is too full. I wanted to insult\nthe man, and to drive him away, but I could do nothing of the kind. On\nthe contrary, I felt that I was disturbing them, and that it was my\nfault. I made a presence of approving everything, this time also,\nthanks to that strange feeling that forced me to treat him the more\namiably in proportion as his presence was more painful to me. I said\nthat I trusted to his taste, and I advised my wife to do the same. He\nremained just as long as it was necessary in order to efface the\nunpleasant impression of my abrupt entrance with a frightened face. He\nwent away with an air of satisfaction at the conclusions arrived at. As\nfor me, I was perfectly sure that, in comparison with that which\npreoccupied them, the question of music was indifferent to them. I\naccompanied him with especial courtesy to the hall (how can one help\naccompanying a man who has come to disturb your tranquillity and ruin\nthe happiness of the entire family?), and I shook his white, soft hand\nwith fervent amiability.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that day I did not speak to my wife. I could not. Her proximity\nexcited such hatred that I feared myself. At the table she asked me, in\npresence of the children, when I was to start upon a journey. I was to\ngo the following week to an assembly of the Zemstvo, in a neighboring\nlocality. I named the date. She asked me if I would need anything for\nthe journey. I did not answer. I sat silent at the table, and silently\nI retired to my study. In those last days she never entered my study,\nespecially at that hour. Suddenly I heard her steps, her walk, and then\na terribly base idea entered my head that, like the wife of Uri, she\nwished to conceal a fault already committed, and that it was for this\nreason that she came to see me at this unseasonable hour. \xe2\x80\x98Is it\npossible,\xe2\x80\x99 thought I, \xe2\x80\x98that she is coming to see me?\xe2\x80\x99 On hearing her\nstep as it approached: \xe2\x80\x98If it is to see me that she is coming, then I\nam right.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn inexpressible hatred invaded my soul. The steps drew nearer, and\nnearer, and nearer yet. Would she pass by and go on to the other room?\nNo, the hinges creaked, and at the door her tall, graceful, languid\nfigure appeared. In her face, in her eyes, a timidity, an insinuating\nexpression, which she tried to hide, but which I saw, and of which I\nunderstood the meaning. I came near suffocating, such were my efforts\nto hold my breath, and, continuing to look at her, I took my cigarette,\nand lighted it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What does this mean? One comes to talk with you, and you go to\nsmoking.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she sat down beside me on the sofa, resting against my shoulder. I\nrecoiled, that I might not touch her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I see that you are displeased with what I wish to play on Sunday,\xe2\x80\x99\nsaid she.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I am not at all displeased,\xe2\x80\x99 said I.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Can I not see?\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Well, I congratulate you on your clairvoyance. Only to you every\nbaseness is agreeable, and I abhor it.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98If you are going to swear like a trooper, I am going away.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Then go away. Only know that, if the honor of the family is nothing\nto you, to me it is dear. As for you, the devil take you!\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What! What is the matter?\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Go away, in the name of God.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she did not go away. Was she pretending not to understand, or did\nshe really not understand what I meant? But she was offended and became\nangry.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You have become absolutely impossible,\xe2\x80\x99 she began, or some such\nphrase as that regarding my character, trying, as usual, to give me as\nmuch pain as possible. \xe2\x80\x98After what you have done to my sister (she\nreferred to an incident with her sister, in which, beside myself, I had\nuttered brutalities; she knew that that tortured me, and tried to touch\nme in that tender spot) nothing will astonish me.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes, offended, humiliated, and dishonored, and after that to hold me\nstill responsible,\xe2\x80\x99 thought I, and suddenly a rage, such a hatred\ninvaded me as I do not remember to have ever felt before. For the first\ntime I desired to express this hatred physically. I leaped upon her,\nbut at the same moment I understood my condition, and I asked myself\nwhether it would be well for me to abandon myself to my fury. And I\nanswered myself that it would be well, that it would frighten her, and,\ninstead of resisting, I lashed and spurred myself on, and was glad to\nfeel my anger boiling more and more fiercely.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Go away, or I will kill you!\xe2\x80\x99 I cried, purposely, with a frightful\nvoice, and I grasped her by the arm. She did not go away. Then I\ntwisted her arm, and pushed her away violently.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What is the matter with you? Come to your senses!\xe2\x80\x99 she shrieked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Go away,\xe2\x80\x99 roared I, louder than ever, rolling my eyes wildly. \xe2\x80\x98It\ntakes you to put me in such a fury. I do not answer for myself! Go\naway!\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn abandoning myself to my anger, I became steeped in it, and I wanted\nto commit some violent act to show the force of my fury. I felt a\nterrible desire to beat her, to kill her, but I realized that that\ncould not be, and I restrained myself. I drew back from her, rushed to\nthe table, grasped the paper-weight, and threw it on the floor by her\nside. I took care to aim a little to one side, and, before she\ndisappeared (I did it so that she could see it), I grasped a\ncandlestick, which I also hurled, and then took down the barometer,\ncontinuing to shout:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Go away! I do not answer for myself!\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe disappeared, and I immediately ceased my demonstrations. An hour\nlater the old servant came to me and said that my wife was in a fit of\nhysterics. I went to see her. She sobbed and laughed, incapable of\nexpressing anything, her whole body in a tremble. She was not shamming,\nshe was really sick. We sent for the doctor, and all night long I cared\nfor her. Toward daylight she grew calmer, and we became reconciled\nunder the influence of that feeling which we called \xe2\x80\x98love.\xe2\x80\x99 The next\nmorning, when, after the reconciliation, I confessed to her that I was\njealous of Troukhatchevsky, she was not at all embarrassed, and began\nto laugh in the most natural way, so strange did the possibility of\nbeing led astray by such a man appear to her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98With such a man can an honest woman entertain any feeling beyond the\npleasure of enjoying music with him? But if you like, I am ready to\nnever see him again, even on Sunday, although everybody has been\ninvited. Write him that I am indisposed, and that will end the matter.\nOnly one thing annoys me,\xe2\x80\x94that any one could have thought him\ndangerous. I am too proud not to detest such thoughts.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she did not lie. She believed what she said. She hoped by her\nwords to provoke in herself a contempt for him, and thereby to defend\nherself. But she did not succeed. Everything was directed against her,\nespecially that abominable music. So ended the quarrel, and on Sunday\nour guests came, and Troukhatchevsky and my wife again played\ntogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think that it is superfluous to say that I was very vain. If one has\nno vanity in this life of ours, there is no sufficient reason for\nliving. So for that Sunday I had busied myself in tastefully arranging\nthings for the dinner and the musical _soir\xc3\xa9e_. I had purchased myself\nnumerous things for the dinner, and had chosen the guests. Toward six\no\xe2\x80\x99clock they arrived, and after them Troukhatchevsky, in his\ndress-coat, with diamond shirt-studs, in bad taste. He bore himself\nwith ease. To all questions he responded promptly, with a smile of\ncontentment and understanding, and that peculiar expression which was\nintended to mean: \xe2\x80\x98All that you may do and say will be exactly what I\nexpected.\xe2\x80\x99 Everything about him that was not correct I now noticed with\nespecial pleasure, for it all tended to tranquillize me, and prove to\nme that to my wife he stood in such a degree of inferiority that, as\nshe had told me, she could not stoop to his level. Less because of my\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s assurances than because of the atrocious sufferings which I felt\nin jealousy, I no longer allowed myself to be jealous.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn spite of that, I was not at ease with the musician or with her\nduring dinner-time and the time that elapsed before the beginning of\nthe music. Involuntarily I followed each of their gestures and looks.\nThe dinner, like all dinners, was tiresome and conventional. Not long\nafterward the music began. He went to get his violin; my wife advanced\nto the piano, and rummaged among the scores. Oh, how well I remember\nall the details of that evening! I remember how he brought the violin,\nhow he opened the box, took off the serge embroidered by a lady\xe2\x80\x99s hand,\nand began to tune the instrument. I can still see my wife sit down,\nwith a false air of indifference, under which it was plain that she hid\na great timidity, a timidity that was especially due to her comparative\nlack of musical knowledge. She sat down with that false air in front of\nthe piano, and then began the usual preliminaries,\xe2\x80\x94the _pizzicati_ of\nthe violin and the arrangement of the scores. I remember then how they\nlooked at each other, and cast a glance at their auditors who were\ntaking their seats. They said a few words to each other, and the music\nbegan. They played Beethoven\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Kreutzer Sonata.\xe2\x80\x99 Do you know the first\n_presto?_ Do you know it? Ah!\xe2\x80\x9d . . .\n\nPosdnicheff heaved a sigh, and was silent for a long time.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA terrible thing is that sonata, especially the _presto!_ And a\nterrible thing is music in general. What is it? Why does it do what it\ndoes? They say that music stirs the soul. Stupidity! A lie! It acts, it\nacts frightfully (I speak for myself), but not in an ennobling way. It\nacts neither in an ennobling nor a debasing way, but in an irritating\nway. How shall I say it? Music makes me forget my real situation. It\ntransports me into a state which is not my own. Under the influence of\nmusic I really seem to feel what I do not feel, to understand what I do\nnot understand, to have powers which I cannot have. Music seems to me\nto act like yawning or laughter; I have no desire to sleep, but I yawn\nwhen I see others yawn; with no reason to laugh, I laugh when I hear\nothers laugh. And music transports me immediately into the condition of\nsoul in which he who wrote the music found himself at that time. I\nbecome confounded with his soul, and with him I pass from one condition\nto another. But why that? I know nothing about it? But he who wrote\nBeethoven\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Kreutzer Sonata\xe2\x80\x99 knew well why he found himself in a\ncertain condition. That condition led him to certain actions, and for\nthat reason to him had a meaning, but to me none, none whatever. And\nthat is why music provokes an excitement which it does not bring to a\nconclusion. For instance, a military march is played; the soldier\npasses to the sound of this march, and the music is finished. A dance\nis played; I have finished dancing, and the music is finished. A mass\nis sung; I receive the sacrament, and again the music is finished. But\nany other music provokes an excitement, and this excitement is not\naccompanied by the thing that needs properly to be done, and that is\nwhy music is so dangerous, and sometimes acts so frightfully.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn China music is under the control of the State, and that is the way\nit ought to be. Is it admissible that the first comer should hypnotize\none or more persons, and then do with them as he likes? And especially\nthat the hypnotizer should be the first immoral individual who happens\nto come along? It is a frightful power in the hands of any one, no\nmatter whom. For instance, should they be allowed to play this\n\xe2\x80\x98Kreutzer Sonata,\xe2\x80\x99 the first _presto_,\xe2\x80\x94and there are many like it,\xe2\x80\x94in\nparlors, among ladies wearing low necked dresses, or in concerts, then\nfinish the piece, receive the applause, and then begin another piece?\nThese things should be played under certain circumstances, only in\ncases where it is necessary to incite certain actions corresponding to\nthe music. But to incite an energy of feeling which corresponds to\nneither the time nor the place, and is expended in nothing, cannot fail\nto act dangerously. On me in particular this piece acted in a frightful\nmanner. One would have said that new sentiments, new virtualities, of\nwhich I was formerly ignorant, had developed in me. \xe2\x80\x98Ah, yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s\nit! Not at all as I lived and thought before! This is the right way to\nlive!\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus I spoke to my soul as I listened to that music. What was this new\nthing that I thus learned? That I did not realize, but the\nconsciousness of this indefinite state filled me with joy. In that\nstate there was no room for jealousy. The same faces, and among them\n_he_ and my wife, I saw in a different light. This music transported me\ninto an unknown world, where there was no room for jealousy. Jealousy\nand the feelings that provoke it seemed to me trivialities, nor worth\nthinking of.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter the _presto_ followed the _andante_, not very new, with\ncommonplace variations, and the feeble _finale_. Then they played more,\nat the request of the guests,\xe2\x80\x94first an elegy by Ernst, and then various\nother pieces. They were all very well, but did not produce upon me a\ntenth part of the impression that the opening piece did. I felt light\nand gay throughout the evening. As for my wife, never had I seen her as\nshe was that night. Those brilliant eyes, that severity and majestic\nexpression while she was playing, and then that utter languor, that\nweak, pitiable, and happy smile after she had finished,\xe2\x80\x94I saw them all\nand attached no importance to them, believing that she felt as I did,\nthat to her, as to me, new sentiments had been revealed, as through a\nfog. During almost the whole evening I was not jealous.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo days later I was to start for the assembly of the Zemstvo, and for\nthat reason, on taking leave of me and carrying all his scores with\nhim, Troukhatchevsky asked me when I should return. I inferred from\nthat that he believed it impossible to come to my house during my\nabsence, and that was agreeable to me. Now I was not to return before\nhis departure from the city. So we bade each other a definite farewell.\nFor the first time I shook his hand with pleasure, and thanked him for\nthe satisfaction that he had given me. He likewise took leave of my\nwife, and their parting seemed to me very natural and proper. All went\nmarvellously. My wife and I retired, well satisfied with the evening.\nWe talked of our impressions in a general way, and we were nearer\ntogether and more friendly than we had been for a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo days later I started for the assembly, having bid farewell to my\nwife in an excellent and tranquil state of mind. In the district there\nwas always much to be done. It was a world and a life apart. During two\ndays I spent ten hours at the sessions. The evening of the second day,\non returning to my district lodgings, I found a letter from my wife,\ntelling me of the children, of their uncle, of the servants, and, among\nother things, as if it were perfectly natural, that Troukhatchevsky had\nbeen at the house, and had brought her the promised scores. He had also\nproposed that they play again, but she had refused.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor my part, I did not remember at all that he had promised any score.\nIt had seemed to me on Sunday evening that he took a definite leave,\nand for this reason the news gave me a disagreeable surprise. I read\nthe letter again. There was something tender and timid about it. It\nproduced an extremely painful impression upon me. My heart swelled, and\nthe mad beast of jealousy began to roar in his lair, and seemed to want\nto leap upon his prey. But I was afraid of this beast, and I imposed\nsilence upon it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an abominable sentiment is jealousy! \xe2\x80\x98What could be more natural\nthan what she has written?\xe2\x80\x99 said I to myself. I went to bed, thinking\nmyself tranquil again. I thought of the business that remained to be\ndone, and I went to sleep without thinking of her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuring these assemblies of the Zemstvo I always slept badly in my\nstrange quarters. That night I went to sleep directly, but, as\nsometimes happens, a sort of sudden shock awoke me. I thought\nimmediately of her, of my physical love for her, of Troukhatchevsky,\nand that between them everything had happened. And a feeling of rage\ncompressed my heart, and I tried to quiet myself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98How stupid!\xe2\x80\x99 said I to myself; \xe2\x80\x98there is no reason, none at all. And\nwhy humiliate ourselves, herself and myself, and especially myself, by\nsupposing such horrors? This mercenary violinist, known as a bad\nman,\xe2\x80\x94shall I think of him in connection with a respectable woman, the\nmother of a family, _my_ wife? How silly!\xe2\x80\x99 But on the other hand, I\nsaid to myself: \xe2\x80\x98Why should it not happen?\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Was it not the same simple and intelligible feeling in the name\nof which I married, in the name of which I was living with her, the\nonly thing I wanted of her, and that which, consequently, others\ndesired, this musician among the rest? He was not married, was in good\nhealth (I remember how his teeth ground the gristle of the cutlets, and\nhow eagerly he emptied the glass of wine with his red lips), was\ncareful of his person, well fed, and not only without principles, but\nevidently with the principle that one should take advantage of the\npleasure that offers itself. There was a bond between them, music,\xe2\x80\x94the\nmost refined form of sensual voluptuousness. What was there to restrain\nthem? Nothing. Everything, on the contrary, attracted them. And she,\nshe had been and had remained a mystery. I did not know her. I knew her\nonly as an animal, and an animal nothing can or should restrain. And\nnow I remember their faces on Sunday evening, when, after the \xe2\x80\x98Kreutzer\nSonata,\xe2\x80\x99 they played a passionate piece, written I know not by whom,\nbut a piece passionate to the point of obscenity.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98How could I have gone away?\xe2\x80\x99 said I to myself, as I recalled their\nfaces. \xe2\x80\x98Was it not clear that between them everything was done that\nevening? Was it not clear that between them not only there were no more\nobstacles, but that both\xe2\x80\x94especially she\xe2\x80\x94felt a certain shame after what\nhad happened at the piano? How weakly, pitiably, happily she smiled, as\nshe wiped the perspiration from her reddened face! They already avoided\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and only at the supper, when she poured some water\nfor him, did they look at each other and smile imperceptibly.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I remember with fright that look and that scarcely perceptible\nsmile. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, everything has happened,\xe2\x80\x99 a voice said to me, and directly\nanother said the opposite. \xe2\x80\x98Are you mad? It is impossible!\xe2\x80\x99 said the\nsecond voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was too painful to me to remain thus stretched in the darkness. I\nstruck a match, and the little yellow-papered room frightened me. I\nlighted a cigarette, and, as always happens, when one turns in a circle\nof inextricable contradiction, I began to smoke. I smoked cigarette\nafter cigarette to dull my senses, that I might not see my\ncontradictions. All night I did not sleep, and at five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when it\nwas not yet light, I decided that I could stand this strain no longer,\nand that I would leave directly. There was a train at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock. I\nawakened the keeper who was acting as my servant, and sent him to look\nfor horses. To the assembly of Zemstvo I sent a message that I was\ncalled back to Moscow by pressing business, and that I begged them to\nsubstitute for me a member of the Committee. At eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock I got\ninto a _tarantass_ and started off.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had to go twenty-five versts by carriage and eight hours by train.\nBy carriage it was a very pleasant journey. The coolness of autumn was\naccompanied by a brilliant sun. You know the weather when the wheels\nimprint themselves upon the dirty road. The road was level, and the\nlight strong, and the air strengthening. The _tarantass_ was\ncomfortable. As I looked at the horses, the fields, and the people whom\nwe passed, I forgot where I was going. Sometimes it seemed to me that I\nwas travelling without an object,\xe2\x80\x94simply promenading,\xe2\x80\x94and that I should\ngo on thus to the end of the world. And I was happy when I so forgot\nmyself. But when I remembered where I was going, I said to myself: \xe2\x80\x98I\nshall see later. Don\xe2\x80\x99t think about it.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen half way, an incident happened to distract me still further. The\n_tarantass_, though new, broke down, and had to be repaired. The delays\nin looking for a _t\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8gue_, the repairs, the payment, the tea in the\ninn, the conversation with the _dvornik_, all served to amuse me.\nToward nightfall all was ready, and I started off again. By night the\njourney was still pleasanter than by day. The moon in its first\nquarter, a slight frost, the road still in good condition, the horses,\nthe sprightly coachman, all served to put me in good spirits. I\nscarcely thought of what awaited me, and was gay perhaps because of the\nvery thing that awaited me, and because I was about to say farewell to\nthe joys of life.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this tranquil state, the power of conquering my preoccupation, all\nended with the carriage drive. Scarcely had I entered the cars, when\nthe other thing began. Those eight hours on the rail were so terrible\nto me that I shall never forget them in my life. Was it because on\nentering the car I had a vivid imagination of having already arrived,\nor because the railway acts upon people in such an exciting fashion? At\nany rate, after boarding the train I could no longer control my\nimagination, which incessantly, with extraordinary vivacity, drew\npictures before my eyes, each more cynical than its predecessor, which\nkindled my jealousy. And always the same things about what was\nhappening at home during my absence. I burned with indignation, with\nrage, and with a peculiar feeling which steeped me in humiliation, as I\ncontemplated these pictures. And I could not tear myself out of this\ncondition. I could not help looking at them, I could not efface them, I\ncould not keep from evoking them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe more I looked at these imaginary pictures, the more I believed in\ntheir reality, forgetting that they had no serious foundation. The\nvivacity of these images seemed to prove to me that my imaginations\nwere a reality. One would have said that a demon, against my will, was\ninventing and breathing into me the most terrible fictions. A\nconversation which dated a long time back, with the brother of\nTroukhatchevsky, I remembered at that moment, in a sort of ecstasy, and\nit tore my heart as I connected it with the musician and my wife. Yes,\nit was very long ago. The brother of Troukhatchevsky, answering my\nquestions as to whether he frequented disreputable houses, said that a\nrespectable man does not go where he may contract a disease, in a low\nand unclean spot, when one can find an honest woman. And here he, his\nbrother, the musician, had found the honest woman. \xe2\x80\x98It is true that she\nis no longer in her early youth. She has lost a tooth on one side, and\nher face is slightly bloated,\xe2\x80\x99 thought I for Troukhatchevsky. \xe2\x80\x98But what\nis to be done? One must profit by what one has.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes, he is bound to take her for his mistress,\xe2\x80\x99 said I to myself\nagain; \xe2\x80\x98and besides, she is not dangerous.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98No, it is not possible\xe2\x80\x99 I rejoined in fright. \xe2\x80\x98Nothing, nothing of\nthe kind has happened, and there is no reason to suppose there has. Did\nshe not tell me that the very idea that I could be jealous of her\nbecause of him was humiliating to her?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes, but she lied,\xe2\x80\x99 I cried,\nand all began over again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were only two travellers in my compartment: an old woman with\nher husband, neither of them very talkative; and even they got out at\none of the stations, leaving me all alone. I was like a beast in a\ncage. Now I jumped up and approached the window, now I began to walk\nback and forth, staggering as if I hoped to make the train go faster by\nmy efforts, and the car with its seats and its windows trembled\ncontinually, as ours does now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Posdnicheff rose abruptly, took a few steps, and sat down again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am afraid, I am afraid of railway carriages. Fear seizes me. I\nsat down again, and I said to myself: \xe2\x80\x98I must think of something else.\nFor instance, of the inn keeper at whose house I took tea.\xe2\x80\x99 And then,\nin my imagination arose the _dvornik_, with his long beard, and his\ngrandson, a little fellow of the same age as my little Basile. My\nlittle Basile! My little Basile! He will see the musician kiss his\nmother! What thoughts will pass through his poor soul! But what does\nthat matter to her! She loves.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd again it all began, the circle of the same thoughts. I suffered so\nmuch that at last I did not know what to do with myself, and an idea\npassed through my head that pleased me much,\xe2\x80\x94to get out upon the rails,\nthrow myself under the cars, and thus finish everything. One thing\nprevented me from doing so. It was pity! It was pity for myself,\nevoking at the same time a hatred for her, for him, but not so much for\nhim. Toward him I felt a strange sentiment of my humiliation and his\nvictory, but toward her a terrible hatred.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98But I cannot kill myself and leave her free. She must suffer, she\nmust understand at least that I have suffered,\xe2\x80\x99 said I to myself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt a station I saw people drinking at the lunch counter, and directly\nI went to swallow a glass of vodka. Beside me stood a Jew, drinking\nalso. He began to talk to me, and I, in order not to be left alone in\nmy compartment, went with him into his third-class, dirty, full of\nsmoke, and covered with peelings and sunflower seeds. There I sat down\nbeside the Jew, and, as it seemed, he told many anecdotes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst I listened to him, but I did not understand what he said. He\nnoticed it, and exacted my attention to his person. Then I rose and\nentered my own compartment.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I must consider,\xe2\x80\x99 said I to myself, \xe2\x80\x98whether what I think is true,\nwhether there is any reason to torment myself.\xe2\x80\x99 I sat down, wishing to\nreflect quietly; but directly, instead of the peaceful reflections, the\nsame thing began again. Instead of the reasoning, the pictures.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98How many times have I tormented myself in this way,\xe2\x80\x99 I thought (I\nrecalled previous and similar fits of jealousy), \xe2\x80\x98and then seen it end\nin nothing at all? It is the same now. Perhaps, yes, surely, I shall\nfind her quietly sleeping. She will awaken, she will be glad, and in\nher words and looks I shall see that nothing has happened, that all\nthis is vain. Ah, if it would only so turn out!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98But no, that has\nhappened too often! Now the end has come,\xe2\x80\x99 a voice said to me.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd again it all began. Ah, what torture! It is not to a hospital\nfilled with syphilitic patients that I would take a young man to\ndeprive him of the desire for women, but into my soul, to show him the\ndemon which tore it. The frightful part was that I recognized in myself\nan indisputable right to the body of my wife, as if her body were\nentirely mine. And at the same time I felt that I could not possess\nthis body, that it was not mine, that she could do with it as she\nliked, and that she liked to do with it as I did not like. And I was\npowerless against him and against her. He, like the Vanka of the song,\nwould sing, before mounting the gallows, how he would kiss her sweet\nlips, etc., and he would even have the best of it before death. With\nher it was still worse. If she _had not done it_, she had the desire,\nshe wished to do it, and I knew that she did. That was worse yet. It\nwould be better if she had already done it, to relieve me of my\nuncertainty.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn short, I could not say what I desired. I desired that she might not\nwant what she _must_ want. It was complete madness.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the station before the last, when the conductor came to take the\ntickets, I took my baggage and went out on the car platform, and the\nconsciousness that the climax was near at hand only added to my\nagitation. I was cold, my jaw trembled so that my teeth chattered.\nMechanically I left the station with the crowd, I took a _tchik_, and I\nstarted. I looked at the few people passing in the streets and at the\n_dvorniks_. I read the signs, without thinking of anything. After going\nhalf a verst my feet began to feel cold, and I remembered that in the\ncar I had taken off my woollen socks, and had put them in my travelling\nbag. Where had I put the bag? Was it with me? Yes, and the basket?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bethought myself that I had totally forgotten my baggage. I took out\nmy check, and then decided it was not worth while to return. I\ncontinued on my way. In spite of all my efforts to remember, I cannot\nat this moment make out why I was in such a hurry. I know only that I\nwas conscious that a serious and menacing event was approaching in my\nlife. It was a case of real auto-suggestion. Was it so serious because\nI thought it so? Or had I a presentiment? I do not know. Perhaps, too,\nafter what has happened, all previous events have taken on a lugubrious\ntint in my memory.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI arrived at the steps. It was an hour past midnight. A few\n_isvotchiks_ were before the door, awaiting customers, attracted by the\nlighted windows (the lighted windows were those of our parlor and\nreception room). Without trying to account for this late illumination,\nI went up the steps, always with the same expectation of something\nterrible, and I rang. The servant, a good, industrious, and very stupid\nbeing, named Gregor, opened the door. The first thing that leaped to my\neyes in the hall, on the hat-stand, among other garments, was an\novercoat. I ought to have been astonished, but I was not astonished. I\nexpected it. \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s it!\xe2\x80\x99 I said to myself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I had asked Gregor who was there, and he had named\nTroukhatchevsky, I inquired whether there were other visitors. He\nanswered: \xe2\x80\x98Nobody.\xe2\x80\x99 I remember the air with which he said that, with a\ntone that was intended to give me pleasure, and dissipate my doubts.\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s it! that\xe2\x80\x99s it!\xe2\x80\x99 I had the air of saying to myself. \xe2\x80\x98And the\nchildren?\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Thank God, they are very well. They went to sleep long ago.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI scarcely breathed, and I could not keep my jaw from trembling.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it was not as I thought. I had often before returned home with\nthe thought that a misfortune had awaited me, but had been mistaken,\nand everything was going on as usual. But now things were not going on\nas usual. All that I had imagined, all that I believed to be chimeras,\nall really existed. Here was the truth.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was on the point of sobbing, but straightway the demon whispered in\nmy ear: \xe2\x80\x98Weep and be sentimental, and they will separate quietly, and\nthere will be no proofs, and all your life you will doubt and suffer.\xe2\x80\x99\nAnd pity for myself vanished, and there remained only the bestial need\nof some adroit, cunning, and energetic action. I became a beast, an\nintelligent beast.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98No, no,\xe2\x80\x99 said I to Gregor, who was about to announce my arrival. \xe2\x80\x98Do\nthis, take a carriage, and go at once for my baggage. Here is the\ncheck. Start.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe went along the hall to get his overcoat. Fearing lest he might\nfrighten them, I accompanied him to his little room, and waited for him\nto put on his things. In the dining-room could be heard the sound of\nconversation and the rattling of knives and plates. They were eating.\nThey had not heard the ring. \xe2\x80\x98Now if they only do not go out,\xe2\x80\x99 I\nthought.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGregor put on his fur-collared coat and went out. I closed the door\nafter him. I felt anxious when I was alone, thinking that directly I\nshould have to act. How? I did not yet know. I knew only that all was\nended, that there could be no doubt of _his_ innocence, and that in an\ninstant my relations with her were going to be terminated. Before, I\nhad still doubts. I said to myself: \xe2\x80\x98Perhaps this is not true. Perhaps\nI am mistaken.\xe2\x80\x99 Now all doubt had disappeared. All was decided\nirrevocably. Secretly, all alone with him, at night! It is a violation\nof all duties! Or, worse yet, she may make a show of that audacity, of\nthat insolence in crime, which, by its excess, tends to prove\ninnocence. All is clear. No doubt. I feared but one thing,\xe2\x80\x94that they\nmight run in different directions, that they might invent some new lie,\nand thus deprive me of material proof, and of the sorrowful joy of\npunishing, yes, of executing them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to surprise them more quickly, I started on tiptoe for the\ndining-room, not through the parlor, but through the hall and the\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s rooms. In the first room slept the little boy. In the\nsecond, the old nurse moved in her bed, and seemed on the point of\nwaking, and I wondered what she would think when she knew all. And pity\nfor myself gave me such a pang that I could not keep the tears back.\nNot to wake the children, I ran lightly through the hall into my study.\nI dropped upon the sofa, and sobbed. \xe2\x80\x98I, an honest man, I, the son of\nmy parents, who all my life long have dreamed of family happiness, I\nwho have never betrayed! . . . And here my five children, and she\nembracing a musician because he has red lips! No, she is not a woman!\nShe is a bitch, a dirty bitch! Beside the chamber of the children, whom\nshe had pretended to love all her life! And then to think of what she\nwrote me! And how do I know? Perhaps it has always been thus. Perhaps\nall these children, supposed to be mine, are the children of my\nservants. And if I had arrived to-morrow, she would have come to meet\nme with her _coiffure_, with her _corsage_, her indolent and graceful\nmovements (and I see her attractive and ignoble features), and this\njealous animal would have remained forever in my heart, tearing it.\nWhat will the old nurse say? And Gregor? And the poor little Lise? She\nalready understands things. And this impudence, this falsehood, this\nbestial sensuality, that I know so well,\xe2\x80\x99 I said to myself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tried to rise. I could not. My heart was beating so violently that I\ncould not hold myself upon my legs. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, I shall die of a rush of\nblood. She will kill me. That is what she wants. What is it to her to\nkill? But that would be too agreeable to him, and I will not allow him\nto have this pleasure.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, here I am, and there they are. They are laughing, they. . . .\nYes, in spite of the fact that she is no longer in her early youth, he\nhas not disdained her. At any rate, she is by no means ugly, and above\nall, not dangerous to his dear health, to him. Why did I not stifle her\nthen?\xe2\x80\x99 said I to myself, as I remembered that other scene of the\nprevious week, when I drove her from my study, and broke the furniture.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I recalled the state in which I was then. Not only did I recall\nit, but I again entered into the same bestial state. And suddenly there\ncame to me a desire to act, and all reasoning, except such as was\nnecessary to action, vanished from my brain, and I was in the condition\nof a beast, and of a man under the influence of physical excitement\npending a danger, who acts imperturbably, without haste, and yet\nwithout losing a minute, pursuing a definite object.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first thing that I did was to take off my boots, and now, having\nonly stockings on, I advanced toward the wall, over the sofa, where\nfirearms and daggers were hanging, and I took down a curved Damascus\nblade, which I had never used, and which was very sharp. I took it from\nits sheath. I remember that the sheath fell upon the sofa, and that I\nsaid to myself: \xe2\x80\x98I must look for it later; it must not be lost.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I took off my overcoat, which I had kept on all the time, and\nwith wolf-like tread started for _the room_. I do not remember how I\nproceeded, whether I ran or went slowly, through what chambers I\npassed, how I approached the dining-room, how I opened the door, how I\nentered. I remember nothing about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember only the expression of their faces when I opened the door.\nI remember that, because it awakened in me a feeling of sorrowful joy.\nIt was an expression of terror, such as I desired. Never shall I forget\nthat desperate and sudden fright that appeared on their faces when they\nsaw me. He, I believe, was at the table, and, when he saw or heard me,\nhe started, jumped to his feet, and retreated to the sideboard. Fear\nwas the only sentiment that could be read with certainty in his face.\nIn hers, too, fear was to be read, but accompanied by other\nimpressions. And yet, if her face had expressed only fear, perhaps that\nwhich happened would not have happened. But in the expression of her\nface there was at the first moment\xe2\x80\x94at least, I thought I saw it\xe2\x80\x94a\nfeeling of _ennui_, of discontent, at this disturbance of her love and\nhappiness. One would have said that her sole desire was not to be\ndisturbed _in the moment of her happiness_. But these expressions\nappeared upon their faces only for a moment. Terror almost immediately\ngave place to interrogation. Would they lie or not? If yes, they must\nbegin. If not, something else was going to happen. But what?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe gave her a questioning glance. On her face the expression of\nanguish and _ennui_ changed, it seemed to me, when she looked at him,\ninto an expression of anxiety for _him_. For a moment I stood in the\ndoorway, holding the dagger hidden behind my back. Suddenly he smiled,\nand in a voice that was indifferent almost to the point of ridicule, he\nsaid:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98We were having some music.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I did not expect\xe2\x80\x94,\xe2\x80\x99 she began at the same time, chiming in with the\ntone of the other.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut neither he nor she finished their remarks. The same rage that I\nhad felt the previous week took possession of me. I felt the need of\ngiving free course to my violence and \xe2\x80\x98the joy of wrath.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, they did not finish. That other thing was going to begin, of which\nhe was afraid, and was going to annihilate what they wanted to say. I\nthrew myself upon her, still hiding the dagger, that he might not\nprevent me from striking where I desired, in her bosom, under the\nbreast. At that moment he saw . . . and, what I did not expect on his\npart, he quickly seized my hand, and cried:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Come to your senses! What are you doing? Help! Help!\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tore my hands from his grasp, and leaped upon him. I must have been\nvery terrible, for he turned as white as a sheet, to his lips. His eyes\nscintillated singularly, and\xe2\x80\x94again what I did not expect of him\xe2\x80\x94he\nscrambled under the piano, toward the other room. I tried to follow\nhim, but a very heavy weight fell upon my left arm. It was she.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI made an effort to clear myself. She clung more heavily than ever,\nrefusing to let go. This unexpected obstacle, this burden, and this\nrepugnant touch only irritated me the more. I perceived that I was\ncompletely mad, that I must be frightful, and I was glad of it. With a\nsudden impulse, and with all my strength, I dealt her, with my left\nelbow, a blow squarely in the face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe uttered a cry and let go my arm. I wanted to follow the other, but\nI felt that it would be ridiculous to pursue in my stockings the lover\nof my wife, and I did not wish to be grotesque, I wished to be\nterrible. In spite of my extreme rage, I was all the time conscious of\nthe impression that I was making upon others, and even this impression\npartially guided me.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI turned toward her. She had fallen on the long easy chair, and,\ncovering her face at the spot where I had struck her, she looked at me.\nHer features exhibited fear and hatred toward me, her enemy, such as\nthe rat exhibits when one lifts the rat-trap. At least, I saw nothing\nin her but that fear and hatred, the fear and hatred which love for\nanother had provoked. Perhaps I still should have restrained myself,\nand should not have gone to the last extremity, if she had maintained\nsilence. But suddenly she began to speak; she grasped my hand that held\nthe dagger.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Come to your senses! What are you doing? What is the matter with you?\nNothing has happened, nothing, nothing! I swear it to you!\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might have delayed longer, but these last words, from which I\ninferred the contrary of what they affirmed,\xe2\x80\x94that is, that _everything_\nhad happened,\xe2\x80\x94these words called for a reply. And the reply must\ncorrespond to the condition into which I had lashed myself, and which\nwas increasing and must continue to increase. Rage has its laws.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Do not lie, wretch. Do not lie!\xe2\x80\x99 I roared.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith my left hand I seized her hands. She disengaged herself. Then,\nwithout dropping my dagger, I seized her by the throat, forced her to\nthe floor, and began to strangle her. With her two hands she clutched\nmine, tearing them from her throat, stifling. Then I struck her a blow\nwith the dagger, in the left side, between the lower ribs.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen people say that they do not remember what they do in a fit of\nfury, they talk nonsense. It is false. I remember everything.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not lose my consciousness for a single moment. The more I lashed\nmyself to fury, the clearer my mind became, and I could not help seeing\nwhat I did. I cannot say that I knew in advance what I would do, but at\nthe moment when I acted, and it seems to me even a little before, I\nknew what I was doing, as if to make it possible to repent, and to be\nable to say later that I could have stopped.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew that I struck the blow between the ribs, and that the dagger\nentered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the second when I did it, I knew that I was performing a horrible\nact, such as I had never performed,\xe2\x80\x94an act that would have frightful\nconsequences. My thought was as quick as lightning, and the deed\nfollowed immediately. The act, to my inner sense, had an extraordinary\nclearness. I perceived the resistance of the corset and then something\nelse, and then the sinking of the knife into a soft substance. She\nclutched at the dagger with her hands, and cut herself with it, but\ncould not restrain the blow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLong afterward, in prison when the moral revolution had been effected\nwithin me, I thought of that minute, I remembered it as far as I could,\nand I co-ordinated all the sudden changes. I remembered the terrible\nconsciousness which I felt,\xe2\x80\x94that I was killing a wife, _my_ wife.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI well remember the horror of that consciousness and I know vaguely\nthat, having plunged in the dagger, I drew it out again immediately,\nwishing to repair and arrest my action. She straightened up and cried:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Nurse, he has killed me!\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old nurse, who had heard the noise, was standing in the doorway. I\nwas still erect, waiting, and not believing myself in what had\nhappened. But at that moment, from under her corset, the blood gushed\nforth. Then only did I understand that all reparation was impossible,\nand promptly I decided that it was not even necessary, that all had\nhappened in accordance with my wish, and that I had fulfilled my\ndesire. I waited until she fell, and until the nurse, exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x98Oh,\nmy God!\xe2\x80\x99 ran to her; then only I threw away the dagger and went out of\nthe room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I must not be agitated. I must be conscious of what I am doing,\xe2\x80\x99 I\nsaid to myself, looking neither at her nor at the old nurse. The latter\ncried and called the maid. I passed through the hall, and, after having\nsent the maid, started for my study.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What shall I do now?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked myself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd immediately I understood what I should do. Directly after entering\nthe study, I went straight to the wall, took down the revolver, and\nexamined it attentively. It was loaded. Then I placed it on the table.\nNext I picked up the sheath of the dagger, which had dropped down\nbehind the sofa, and then I sat down. I remained thus for a long time.\nI thought of nothing, I did not try to remember anything. I heard a\nstifled noise of steps, a movement of objects and of tapestries, then\nthe arrival of a person, and then the arrival of another person. Then I\nsaw Gregor bring into my room the baggage from the railway; as if any\none needed it!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Have you heard what has happened?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked him. \xe2\x80\x98Have you told the\n_dvornik_ to inform the police?\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe made no answer, and went out. I rose, closed the door, took the\ncigarettes and the matches, and began to smoke. I had not finished one\ncigarette, when a drowsy feeling came over me and sent me into a deep\nsleep. I surely slept two hours. I remember having dreamed that I was\non good terms with her, that after a quarrel we were in the act of\nmaking up, that something prevented us, but that we were friends all\nthe same.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA knock at the door awoke me.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98It is the police,\xe2\x80\x99 thought I, as I opened my eyes. \xe2\x80\x98I have killed, I\nbelieve. But perhaps it is _she;_ perhaps nothing has happened.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother knock. I did not answer. I was solving the question: \xe2\x80\x98Has it\nhappened or not? Yes, it has happened.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remembered the resistance of the corset, and then. . . . \xe2\x80\x98Yes, it\nhas happened. Yes, it has happened. Yes, now I must execute myself,\xe2\x80\x99\nsaid I to myself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said it, but I knew well that I should not kill myself.\nNevertheless, I rose and took the revolver, but, strange thing, I\nremembered that formerly I had very often had suicidal ideas, that that\nvery night, on the cars, it had seemed to me easy, especially easy\nbecause I thought how it would stupefy her. Now I not only could not\nkill myself, but I could not even think of it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Why do it?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked myself, without answering.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother knock at the door.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes, but I must first know who is knocking. I have time enough.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI put the revolver back on the table, and hid it under my newspaper. I\nwent to the door and drew back the bolt.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was my wife\xe2\x80\x99s sister,\xe2\x80\x94a good and stupid widow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Basile, what does this mean?\xe2\x80\x99 said she, and her tears, always ready,\nbegan to flow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What do you want?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked roughly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw clearly that there was no necessity of being rough with her, but\nI could not speak in any other tone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Basile, she is dying. Ivan Fedorowitch says so.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIvan Fedorowitch was the doctor, _her_ doctor, her counsellor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Is he here?\xe2\x80\x99 I inquired.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd all my hatred of her arose anew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Basile, go to her! Ah! how terrible it is!\xe2\x80\x99 said she.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Go to her?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked myself; and immediately I made answer to myself\nthat I ought to go, that probably that was the thing that is usually\ndone when a husband like myself kills his wife, that it was absolutely\nnecessary that I should go and see her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98If that is the proper thing, I must go,\xe2\x80\x99 I repeated to myself. \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\nif it is necessary, I shall still have time,\xe2\x80\x99 said I to myself,\nthinking of my intention of blowing my brains out.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I followed my sister-in-law. \xe2\x80\x98Now there are going to be phrases\nand grimaces, but I will not yield,\xe2\x80\x99 I declared to myself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Wait,\xe2\x80\x99 said I to my sister-in-law, \xe2\x80\x98it is stupid to be without boots.\nLet me at least put on my slippers.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrange thing! Again, when I had left my study, and was passing\nthrough the familiar rooms, again the hope came to me that nothing had\nhappened. But the odor of the drugs, iodoform and phenic acid, brought\nme back to a sense of reality.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98No, everything has happened.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn passing through the hall, beside the children\xe2\x80\x99s chamber, I saw\nlittle Lise. She was looking at me, with eyes that were full of fear. I\neven thought that all the children were looking at me. As I approached\nthe door of our sleeping-room, a servant opened it from within, and\ncame out. The first thing that I noticed was _her_ light gray dress\nupon a chair, all dark with blood. On our common bed she was stretched,\nwith knees drawn up.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe lay very high, upon pillows, with her chemise half open. Linen had\nbeen placed upon the wound. A heavy smell of iodoform filled the room.\nBefore, and more than anything else, I was astonished at her face,\nwhich was swollen and bruised under the eyes and over a part of the\nnose. This was the result of the blow that I had struck her with my\nelbow, when she had tried to hold me back. Of beauty there was no trace\nleft. I saw something hideous in her. I stopped upon the threshold.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Approach, approach her,\xe2\x80\x99 said her sister.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes, probably she repents,\xe2\x80\x99 thought I; \xe2\x80\x98shall I forgive her? Yes, she\nis dying, I must forgive her,\xe2\x80\x99 I added, trying to be generous.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI approached the bedside. With difficulty she raised her eyes, one of\nwhich was swollen, and uttered these words haltingly:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You have accomplished what you desired. You have killed me.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in her face, through the physical sufferings, in spite of the\napproach of death, was expressed the same old hatred, so familiar to\nme.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The children . . . I will not give them to you . . . all the same. .\n. . She (her sister) shall take them.\xe2\x80\x99 . . .\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut of that which I considered essential, of her fault, of her\ntreason, one would have said that she did not think it necessary to say\neven a word.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes, revel in what you have done.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she sobbed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the door stood her sister with the children.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes, see what you have done!\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cast a glance at the children, and then at her bruised and swollen\nface, and for the first time I forgot myself (my rights, my pride), and\nfor the first time I saw in her a human being, a sister.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd all that which a moment before had been so offensive to me now\nseemed to me so petty,\xe2\x80\x94all this jealousy,\xe2\x80\x94and, on the contrary, what I\nhad done seemed to me so important that I felt like bending over,\napproaching my face to her hand, and saying:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Forgive me!\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I did not dare. She was silent, with eyelids lowered, evidently\nhaving no strength to speak further. Then her deformed face began to\ntremble and shrivel, and she feebly pushed me back.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Why has all this happened? Why?\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Forgive me,\xe2\x80\x99 said I.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes, if you had not killed me,\xe2\x80\x99 she cried suddenly, and her eyes\nshone feverishly. \xe2\x80\x98Forgiveness\xe2\x80\x94that is nothing. . . . If I only do not\ndie! Ah, you have accomplished what you desired! I hate you!\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she grew delirious. She was frightened, and cried:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Fire, I do not fear . . . but strike them all . . . He has gone. . .\n. He has gone.\xe2\x80\x99 . . .\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe delirium continued. She no longer recognized the children, not\neven little Lise, who had approached. Toward noon she died. As for me,\nI was arrested before her death, at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning. They\ntook me to the police station, and then to prison, and there, during\neleven months, awaiting the verdict, I reflected upon myself, and upon\nmy past, and I understood it. Yes, I began to understand from the third\nday. The third day they took me to the house.\xe2\x80\x9d . . .\n\nPosdnicheff seemed to wish to add something, but, no longer having the\nstrength to repress his sobs, he stopped. After a few minutes, having\nrecovered his calmness, he resumed:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI began to understand only when I saw her in the coffin.\xe2\x80\x9d . . .\n\nHe uttered a sob, and then immediately continued, with haste:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen only, when I saw her dead face, did I understand all that I had\ndone. I understood that it was I, I, who had killed her. I understood\nthat I was the cause of the fact that she, who had been a moving,\nliving, palpitating being, had now become motionless and cold, and that\nthere was no way of repairing this thing. He who has not lived through\nthat cannot understand it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nWe remained silent a long time. Posdnicheff sobbed and trembled before\nme. His face had become delicate and long, and his mouth had grown\nlarger.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said he suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cif I had known what I now know, I should\nnever have married her, never, not for anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAgain we remained silent for a long time.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is what I have done, that is my experience, We must\nunderstand the real meaning of the words of the Gospel,\xe2\x80\x94Matthew, v.\n28,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed\nadultery\xe2\x80\x99; and these words relate to the wife, to the sister, and not\nonly to the wife of another, but especially to one\xe2\x80\x99s own wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\nLESSON OF \xe2\x80\x9cTHE KREUTZER SONATA.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nI have received, and still continue to receive, numbers of letters from\npersons who are perfect strangers to me, asking me to state in plain\nand simple language my own views on the subject handled in the story\nentitled \xe2\x80\x9cThe Kreutzer Sonata.\xe2\x80\x9d With this request I shall now endeavor\nto comply.\n\nMy views on the question may be succinctly stated as follows: Without\nentering into details, it will be generally admitted that I am accurate\nin saying that many people condone in young men a course of conduct\nwith regard to the other sex which is incompatible with strict\nmorality, and that this dissoluteness is pardoned generally. Both\nparents and the government, in consequence of this view, may be said to\nwink at profligacy, and even in the last resource to encourage its\npractice. I am of opinion that this is not right.\n\nIt is not possible that the health of one class should necessitate the\nruin of another, and, in consequence, it is our first duty to turn a\ndeaf ear to such an essential immoral doctrine, no matter how strongly\nsociety may have established or law protected it. Moreover, it needs to\nbe fully recognized that men are rightly to be held responsible for the\nconsequences of their own acts, and that these are no longer to be\nvisited on the woman alone. It follows from this that it is the duty of\nmen who do not wish to lead a life of infamy to practice such\ncontinence in respect to all woman as they would were the female\nsociety in which they move made up exclusively of their own mothers and\nsisters.\n\nA more rational mode of life should be adopted which would include\nabstinence from all alcoholic drinks, from excess in eating and from\nflesh meat, on the one hand, and recourse to physical labor on the\nother. I am not speaking of gymnastics, or of any of those occupations\nwhich may be fitly described as playing at work; I mean the genuine\ntoil that fatigues. No one need go far in search of proofs that this\nkind of abstemious living is not merely possible, but far less hurtful\nto health than excess. Hundreds of instances are known to every one.\nThis is my first contention.\n\nIn the second place, I think that of late years, through various\nreasons which I need not enter, but among which the above-mentioned\nlaxity of opinion in society and the frequent idealization of the\nsubject in current literature and painting may be mentioned, conjugal\ninfidelity has become more common and is considered less reprehensible.\nI am of opinion that this is not right. The origin of the evil is\ntwofold. It is due, in the first place, to a natural instinct, and, in\nthe second, to the elevation of this instinct to a place to which it\ndoes not rightly belong. This being so, the evil can only be remedied\nby effecting a change in the views now in vogue about \xe2\x80\x9cfalling in love\xe2\x80\x9d\nand all that this term implies, by educating men and women at home\nthrough family influence and example, and abroad by means of healthy\npublic opinion, to practice that abstinence which morality and\nChristianity alike enjoin. This is my second contention.\n\nIn the third place I am of opinion that another consequence of the\nfalse light in which \xe2\x80\x9cfalling in love,\xe2\x80\x9d and what it leads to, are\nviewed in our society, is that the birth of children has lost its\npristine significance, and that modern marriages are conceived less and\nless from the point of view of the family. I am of opinion that this is\nnot right. This is my third contention.\n\nIn the fourth place, I am of opinion that the children (who in our\nsociety are considered an obstacle to enjoyment\xe2\x80\x94an unlucky accident, as\nit were) are educated not with a view to the problem which they will be\none day called on to face and to solve, but solely with an eye to the\npleasure which they may be made to yield to their parents. The\nconsequence is, that the children of human beings are brought up for\nall the world like the young of animals, the chief care of their\nparents being not to train them to such work as is worthy of men and\nwomen, but to increase their weight, or add a cubit to their stature,\nto make them spruce, sleek, well-fed, and comely. They rig them out in\nall manner of fantastic costumes, wash them, over-feed them, and refuse\nto make them work. If the children of the lower orders differ in this\nlast respect from those of the well-to-do classes, the difference is\nmerely formal; they work from sheer necessity, and not because their\nparents recognize work as a duty. And in over-fed children, as in\nover-fed animals, sensuality is engendered unnaturally early.\n\nFashionable dress to-day, the course of reading, plays, music, dances,\nluscious food, all the elements of our modern life, in a word, from the\npictures on the little boxes of sweetmeats up to the novel, the tale,\nand the poem, contribute to fan this sensuality into a strong,\nconsuming flame, with the result that sexual vices and diseases have\ncome to be the normal conditions of the period of tender youth, and\noften continue into the riper age of full-blown manhood. And I am of\nopinion that this is not right.\n\nIt is high time it ceased. The children of human beings should not be\nbrought up as if they were animals; and we should set up as the object\nand strive to maintain as the result of our labors something better and\nnobler than a well-dressed body. This is my fourth contention.\n\nIn the fifth place, I am of opinion that, owing to the exaggerated and\nerroneous significance attributed by our society to love and to the\nidealized states that accompany and succeed it, the best energies of\nour men and women are drawn forth and exhausted during the most\npromising period of life; those of the men in the work of looking for,\nchoosing, and winning the most desirable objects of love, for which\npurpose lying and fraud are held to be quite excusable; those of the\nwomen and girls in alluring men and decoying them into liaisons or\nmarriage by the most questionable means conceivable, as an instance of\nwhich the present fashions in evening dress may be cited. I am of\nopinion that this is not right.\n\nThe truth is, that the whole affair has been exalted by poets and\nromancers to an undue importance, and that love in its various\ndevelopments is not a fitting object to consume the best energies of\nmen. People set it before them and strive after it, because their view\nof life is as vulgar and brutish as is that other conception frequently\nmet with in the lower stages of development, which sees in luscious and\nabundant food an end worthy of man\xe2\x80\x99s best efforts. Now, this is not\nright and should not be done. And, in order to avoid doing it, it is\nonly needful to realize the fact that whatever truly deserves to be\nheld up as a worthy object of man\xe2\x80\x99s striving and working, whether it be\nthe service of humanity, of one\xe2\x80\x99s country, of science, of art, not to\nspeak of the service of God, is far above and beyond the sphere of\npersonal enjoyment. Hence, it follows that not only to form a liaison,\nbut even to contract marriage, is, from a Christian point of view, not\na progress, but a fall. Love, and all the states that accompany and\nfollow it, however we may try in prose and verse to prove the contrary,\nnever do and never can facilitate the attainment of an aim worthy of\nmen, but always make it more difficult. This is my fifth contention.\n\nHow about the human race? If we admit that celibacy is better and\nnobler than marriage, evidently the human race will come to an end.\nBut, if the logical conclusion of the argument is that the human race\nwill become extinct, the whole reasoning is wrong.\n\nTo that I reply that the argument is not mine; I did not invent it.\nThat it is incumbent on mankind so to strive, and that celibacy is\npreferable to marriage, are truths revealed by Christ 1,900 years ago,\nset forth in our catechisms, and professed by us as followers of\nChrist.\n\nChastity and celibacy, it is urged, cannot constitute the ideal of\nhumanity, because chastity would annihilate the race which strove to\nrealize it, and humanity cannot set up as its ideal its own\nannihilation. It may be pointed out in reply that only that is a true\nideal, which, being unattainable, admits of infinite gradation in\ndegrees of proximity. Such is the Christian ideal of the founding of\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom, the union of all living creatures by the bonds of love.\nThe conception of its attainment is incompatible with the conception of\nthe movement of life. What kind of life could subsist if all living\ncreatures were joined together by the bonds of love? None. Our\nconception of life is inseparably bound up with the conception of a\ncontinual striving after an unattainable ideal.\n\nBut even if we suppose the Christian ideal of perfect chastity\nrealized, what then? We should merely find ourselves face to face on\nthe one hand with the familiar teaching of religion, one of whose\ndogmas is that the world will have an end; and on the other of\nso-called science, which informs us that the sun is gradually losing\nits heat, the result of which will in time be the extinction of the\nhuman race.\n\nNow there is not and cannot be such an institution as Christian\nmarriage, just as there cannot be such a thing as a Christian liturgy\n(Matt. vi. 5-12; John iv. 21), nor Christian teachers, nor church\nfathers (Matt. xxiii. 8-10), nor Christian armies, Christian law\ncourts, nor Christian States. This is what was always taught and\nbelieved by true Christians of the first and following centuries. A\nChristian\xe2\x80\x99s ideal is not marriage, but love for God and for his\nneighbor. Consequently in the eyes of a Christian relations in marriage\nnot only do not constitute a lawful, right, and happy state, as our\nsociety and our churches maintain, but, on the contrary, are always a\nfall.\n\nSuch a thing as Christian marriage never was and never could be. Christ\ndid not marry, nor did he establish marriage; neither did his disciples\nmarry. But if Christian marriage cannot exist, there is such a thing as\na Christian view of marriage. And this is how it may be formulated: A\nChristian (and by this term I understand not those who call themselves\nChristians merely because they were baptized and still receive the\nsacrament once a year, but those whose lives are shaped and regulated\nby the teachings of Christ), I say, cannot view the marriage relation\notherwise than as a deviation from the doctrine of Christ,\xe2\x80\x94as a sin.\nThis is clearly laid down in Matt. v. 28, and the ceremony called\nChristian marriage does not alter its character one jot. A Christian\nwill never, therefore, desire marriage, but will always avoid it.\n\nIf the light of truth dawns upon a Christian when he is already\nmarried, or if, being a Christian, from weakness he enters into marital\nrelations with the ceremonies of the church, or without them, he has no\nother alternative than to abide with his wife (and the wife with her\nhusband, if it is she who is a Christian) and to aspire together with\nher to free themselves of their sin. This is the Christian view of\nmarriage; and there cannot be any other for a man who honestly\nendeavors to shape his life in accordance with the teachings of Christ.\n\nTo very many persons the thoughts I have uttered here and in \xe2\x80\x9cThe\nKreutzer Sonata\xe2\x80\x9d will seem strange, vague, even contradictory. They\ncertainly do contradict, not each other, but the whole tenor of our\nlives, and involuntarily a doubt arises, \xe2\x80\x9con which side is truth,\xe2\x80\x94on\nthe side of the thoughts which seem true and well-founded, or on the\nside of the lives of others and myself?\xe2\x80\x9d I, too, was weighed down by\nthat same doubt when writing \xe2\x80\x9cThe Kreutzer Sonata.\xe2\x80\x9d I had not the\nfaintest presentiment that the train of thought I had started would\nlead me whither it did. I was terrified by my own conclusion, and I was\nat first disposed to reject it, but it was impossible not to hearken to\nthe voice of my reason and my conscience. And so, strange though they\nmay appear to many, opposed as they undoubtedly are to the trend and\ntenor of our lives, and incompatible though they may prove with what I\nhave heretofore thought and uttered, I have no choice but to accept\nthem. \xe2\x80\x9cBut man is weak,\xe2\x80\x9d people will object. \xe2\x80\x9cHis task should be\nregulated by his strength.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis is tantamount to saying, \xe2\x80\x9cMy hand is weak. I cannot draw a\nstraight line,\xe2\x80\x94that is, a line which will be the shortest line between\ntwo given points,\xe2\x80\x94and so, in order to make it more easy for myself, I,\nintending to draw a straight, will choose for my model a crooked line.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe weaker my hand, the greater the need that my model should be\nperfect.\n\n_Leo Tolstoy._\n\n\n\n\nIVAN THE FOOL.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\nIn a certain kingdom there lived a rich peasant, who had three\nsons\xe2\x80\x94Simeon (a soldier), Tarras-Briukhan (fat man), and Ivan (a\nfool)\xe2\x80\x94and one daughter, Milania, born dumb. Simeon went to war, to\nserve the Czar; Tarras went to a city and became a merchant; and Ivan,\nwith his sister, remained at home to work on the farm.\n\nFor his valiant service in the army, Simeon received an estate with\nhigh rank, and married a noble\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. Besides his large pay, he\nwas in receipt of a handsome income from his estate; yet he was unable\nto make ends meet. What the husband saved, the wife wasted in\nextravagance. One day Simeon went to the estate to collect his income,\nwhen the steward informed him that there was no income, saying:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have neither horses, cows, fishing-nets, nor implements; it is\nnecessary first to buy everything, and then to look for income.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSimeon thereupon went to his father and said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are rich, _batiushka_ [little father], but you have given nothing\nto me. Give me one-third of what you possess as my share, and I will\ntransfer it to my estate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old man replied: \xe2\x80\x9cYou did not help to bring prosperity to our\nhousehold. For what reason, then, should you now demand the third part\nof everything? It would be unjust to Ivan and his sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Simeon; \xe2\x80\x9cbut he is a fool, and she was born dumb. What need\nhave they of anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee what Ivan will say.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s reply was: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, let him take his share.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSimeon took the portion allotted to him, and went again to serve in the\narmy.\n\nTarras also met with success. He became rich and married a merchant\xe2\x80\x99s\ndaughter, but even this failed to satisfy his desires, and he also went\nto his father and said, \xe2\x80\x9cGive me my share.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old man, however, refused to comply with his request, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\nhad no hand in the accumulation of our property, and what our household\ncontains is the result of Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s hard work. It would be unjust,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nrepeated, \xe2\x80\x9cto Ivan and his sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTarras replied: \xe2\x80\x9cBut he does not need it. He is a fool, and cannot\nmarry, for no one will have him; and sister does not require anything,\nfor she was born dumb.\xe2\x80\x9d Turning then to Ivan he continued: \xe2\x80\x9cGive me\nhalf the grain you have, and I will not touch the implements or\nfishing-nets; and from the cattle I will take only the dark mare, as\nshe is not fit to plow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan laughed and said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I will go and arrange matters so that\nTarras may have his share,\xe2\x80\x9d whereupon Tarras took the brown mare with\nthe grain to town, leaving Ivan with one old horse to work on as before\nand support his father, mother, and sister.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nIt was disappointing to the _Stary Tchert_ (Old Devil) that the\nbrothers did not quarrel over the division of the property, and that\nthey separated peacefully; and he cried out, calling his three small\ndevils (_Tchertionki_).\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are living three brothers\xe2\x80\x94Simeon the\nsoldier, Tarras-Briukhan, and Ivan the Fool. It is necessary that they\nshould quarrel. Now they live peacefully, and enjoy each other\xe2\x80\x99s\nhospitality. The Fool spoiled all my plans. Now you three go and work\nwith them in such a manner that they will be ready to tear each other\xe2\x80\x99s\neyes out. Can you do this?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can,\xe2\x80\x9d they replied.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow will you accomplish it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn this way: We will first ruin them to such an extent that they will\nhave nothing to eat, and we will then gather them together in one place\nwhere we are sure that they will fight.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; I see you understand your business. Go, and do not return\nto me until you have created a feud between the three brothers\xe2\x80\x94or I\nwill skin you alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe three small devils went to a swamp to consult as to the best means\nof accomplishing their mission. They disputed for a long time\xe2\x80\x94each one\nwanting the easiest part of the work\xe2\x80\x94and not being able to agree,\nconcluded to draw lots; by which it was decided that the one who was\nfirst finished had to come and help the others. This agreement being\nentered into, they appointed a time when they were again to meet in the\nswamp\xe2\x80\x94to find out who was through and who needed assistance.\n\nThe time having arrived, the young devils met in the swamp as agreed,\nwhen each related his experience. The first, who went to Simeon, said:\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have succeeded in my undertaking, and to-morrow Simeon returns to\nhis father.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHis comrades, eager for particulars, inquired how he had done it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9cthe first thing I did was to blow some courage into\nhis veins, and, on the strength of it, Simeon went to the Czar and\noffered to conquer the whole world for him. The Emperor made him\ncommander-in-chief of the forces, and sent him with an army to fight\nthe Viceroy of India. Having started on their mission of conquest, they\nwere unaware that I, following in their wake, had wet all their powder.\nI also went to the Indian ruler and showed him how I could create\nnumberless soldiers from straw.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSimeon\xe2\x80\x99s army, seeing that they were surrounded by such a vast number\nof Indian warriors of my creation, became frightened, and Simeon\ncommanded to fire from cannons and rifles, which of course they were\nunable to do. The soldiers, discouraged, retreated in great disorder.\nThus Simeon brought upon himself the terrible disgrace of defeat. His\nestate was confiscated, and to-morrow he is to be executed. All that\nremains for me to do, therefore,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded the young devil, \xe2\x80\x9cis to\nrelease him to-morrow morning. Now, then, who wants my assistance?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe second small devil (from Tarras) then related his story.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not need any help,\xe2\x80\x9d he began. \xe2\x80\x9cMy business is also all right. My\nwork with Tarras will be finished in one week. In the first place I\nmade him grow thin. He afterward became so covetous that he wanted to\npossess everything he saw, and he spent all the money he had in the\npurchase of immense quantities of goods. When his capital was gone he\nstill continued to buy with borrowed money, and has become involved in\nsuch difficulties that he cannot free himself. At the end of one week\nthe date for the payment of his notes will have expired, and, his goods\nbeing seized upon, he will become a bankrupt; and he also will return\nto his father.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt the conclusion of this narrative they inquired of the third devil\nhow things had fared between him and Ivan.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cmy report is not so encouraging. The first thing I\ndid was to spit into his jug of _quass_ [a sour drink made from rye],\nwhich made him sick at his stomach. He afterward went to plow his\nsummer-fallow, but I made the soil so hard that the plow could scarcely\npenetrate it. I thought the Fool would not succeed, but he started to\nwork nevertheless. Moaning with pain, he still continued to labor. I\nbroke one plow, but he replaced it with another, fixing it securely,\nand resumed work. Going beneath the surface of the ground I took hold\nof the plowshares, but did not succeed in stopping Ivan. He pressed so\nhard, and the colter was so sharp, that my hands were cut; and despite\nmy utmost efforts, he went over all but a small portion of the field.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe concluded with: \xe2\x80\x9cCome, brothers, and help me, for if we do not\nconquer him our whole enterprise will be a failure. If the Fool is\npermitted successfully to conduct his farming, they will have no need,\nfor he will support his brothers.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nIvan having succeeded in plowing all but a small portion of his land,\nhe returned the next day to finish it. The pain in his stomach\ncontinued, but he felt that he must go on with his work. He tried to\nstart his plow, but it would not move; it seemed to have struck a hard\nroot. It was the small devil in the ground who had wound his feet\naround the plowshares and held them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is strange,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Ivan. \xe2\x80\x9cThere were never any roots here\nbefore, and this is surely one.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan put his hand in the ground, and, feeling something soft, grasped\nand pulled it out. It was like a root in appearance, but seemed to\npossess life. Holding it up he saw that it was a little devil.\nDisgusted, he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cSee the nasty thing,\xe2\x80\x9d and he proceeded to\nstrike it a blow, intending to kill it, when the young devil cried out:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not kill me, and I will grant your every wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you do for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me what it is you most wish for,\xe2\x80\x9d the little devil replied.\n\nIvan, peasant-fashion, scratched the back of his head as he thought,\nand finally he said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am dreadfully sick at my stomach. Can you cure me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can,\xe2\x80\x9d the little devil said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe little devil bent toward the earth and began searching for roots,\nand when he found them he gave them to Ivan, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you will\nswallow some of these you will be immediately cured of whatsoever\ndisease you are afflicted with.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan did as directed, and obtained instant relief.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg of you to let me go now,\xe2\x80\x9d the little devil pleaded; \xe2\x80\x9cI will pass\ninto the earth, never to return.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; you may go, and God bless you;\xe2\x80\x9d and as Ivan pronounced the\nname of God, the small devil disappeared into the earth like a flash,\nand only a slight opening in the ground remained.\n\nIvan placed in his hat what roots he had left, and proceeded to plow.\nSoon finishing his work, he turned his plow over and returned home.\n\nWhen he reached the house he found his brother Simeon and his wife\nseated at the supper-table. His estate had been confiscated, and he\nhimself had barely escaped execution by making his way out of prison,\nand having nothing to live upon had come back to his father for\nsupport.\n\nTurning to Ivan he said: \xe2\x80\x9cI came to ask you to care for us until I can\nfind something to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan replied; \xe2\x80\x9cyou may remain with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJust as Ivan was about to sit down to the table Simeon\xe2\x80\x99s wife made a\nwry face, indicating that she did not like the smell of Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s\nsheep-skin coat; and turning to her husband she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall not sit\nat the table with a moujik [peasant] who smells like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSimeon the soldier turned to his brother and said: \xe2\x80\x9cMy lady objects to\nthe smell of your clothes. You may eat in the porch.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan said: \xe2\x80\x9cVery well, it is all the same to me. I will soon have to go\nand feed my horse any way.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan took some bread in one hand, and his _kaftan_ (coat) in the other,\nand left the room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\nThe small devil finished with Simeon that night, and according to\nagreement went to the assistance of his comrade who had charge of Ivan,\nthat he might help to conquer the Fool. He went to the field and\nsearched everywhere, but could find nothing but the hole through which\nthe small devil had disappeared.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, this is strange,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9csomething must have happened to my\ncompanion, and I will have to take his place and continue the work he\nbegan. The Fool is through with his plowing, so I must look about me\nfor some other means of compassing his destruction. I must overflow his\nmeadow and prevent him from cutting the grass.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe little devil accordingly overflowed the meadow with muddy water,\nand, when Ivan went at dawn next morning with his scythe set and\nsharpened and tried to mow the grass, he found that it resisted all his\nefforts and would not yield to the implement as usual.\n\nMany times Ivan tried to cut the grass, but always without success. At\nlast, becoming weary of the effort, he decided to return home and have\nhis scythe again sharpened, and also to procure a quantity of bread,\nsaying: \xe2\x80\x9cI will come back here and will not leave until I have mown all\nthe meadow, even if it should take a whole week.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHearing this, the little devil became thoughtful, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cThat Ivan is\na _koolak_ [hard case], and I must think of some other way of\nconquering him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan soon returned with his sharpened scythe and started to mow.\n\nThe small devil hid himself in the grass, and as the point of the\nscythe came down he buried it in the earth and made it almost\nimpossible for Ivan to move the implement. He, however, succeeded in\nmowing all but one small spot in the swamp, where again the small devil\nhid himself, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cEven if he should cut my hands I will prevent him\nfrom accomplishing his work.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen Ivan came to the swamp he found that the grass was not very thick.\nStill, the scythe would not work, which made him so angry that he\nworked with all his might, and one blow more powerful than the others\ncut off a portion of the small devil\xe2\x80\x99s tail, who had hidden himself\nthere.\n\nDespite the little devil\xe2\x80\x99s efforts he succeeded in finishing his work,\nwhen he returned home and ordered his sister to gather up the grass\nwhile he went to another field to cut rye. But the devil preceded him\nthere, and fixed the rye in such a manner that it was almost impossible\nfor Ivan to cut it; however, after continuous hard labor he succeeded,\nand when he was through with the rye he said to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cNow I will\nstart to mow oats.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOn hearing this, the little devil thought to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cI could not\nprevent him from mowing the rye, but I will surely stop him from mowing\nthe oats when the morning comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEarly next day, when the devil came to the field, he found that the\noats had been already mowed. Ivan did it during the night, so as to\navoid the loss that might have resulted from the grain being too ripe\nand dry. Seeing that Ivan again had escaped him, the little devil\nbecame greatly enraged, saying:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe cut me all over and made me tired, that fool. I did not meet such\nmisfortune even on the battle-field. He does not even sleep;\xe2\x80\x9d and the\ndevil began to swear. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot follow him,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cI will go\nnow to the heaps and make everything rotten.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAccordingly he went to a heap of the new-mown grain and began his\nfiendish work. After wetting it he built a fire and warmed himself, and\nsoon was fast asleep.\n\nIvan harnessed his horse, and, with his sister, went to bring the rye\nhome from the field.\n\nAfter lifting a couple of sheaves from the first heap his pitchfork\ncame into contact with the little devil\xe2\x80\x99s back, which caused the latter\nto howl with pain and to jump around in every direction. Ivan\nexclaimed:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here! What nastiness! You again here?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am another one!\xe2\x80\x9d said the little devil. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was my brother. I am\nthe one who was sent to your brother Simeon.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivan, \xe2\x80\x9cit matters not who you are. I will fix you all the\nsame.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs Ivan was about to strike the first blow the devil pleaded: \xe2\x80\x9cLet me\ngo and I will do you no more harm. I will do whatever you wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you do for me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ivan.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can make soldiers from almost anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what will they be good for?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, they will do everything for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan they sing?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey can.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, make them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake a bunch of straw and scatter it on the ground, and see if each\nstraw will not turn into a soldier.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan shook the straws on the ground, and, as he expected, each straw\nturned into a soldier, and they began marching with a band at their\nhead.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Ishty_ [look you], that was well done! How it will delight the\nvillage maidens!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\n\nThe small devil now said: \xe2\x80\x9cLet me go; you do not need me any longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut Ivan said: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I will not let you go just yet. You have converted\nthe straw into soldiers, and now I want you to turn them again into\nstraw, as I cannot afford to lose it, but I want it with the grain on.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe devil replied: \xe2\x80\x9cSay: \xe2\x80\x98So many soldiers, so much straw.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan did as directed, and got back his rye with the straw.\n\nThe small devil again begged for his release.\n\nIvan, taking him from the pitchfork, said: \xe2\x80\x9cWith God\xe2\x80\x99s blessing you may\ndepart\xe2\x80\x9d; and, as before at the mention of God\xe2\x80\x99s name, the little devil\nwas hurled into the earth like a flash, and nothing was left but the\nhole to show where he had gone.\n\nSoon afterward Ivan returned home, to find his brother Tarras and his\nwife there. Tarras-Briukhan could not pay his debts, and was forced to\nflee from his creditors and seek refuge under his father\xe2\x80\x99s roof. Seeing\nIvan, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Ivan, may we remain here until I start in some\nnew business?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan replied as he had before to Simeon: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, you are perfectly\nwelcome to remain here as long as it suits you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWith that announcement he removed his coat and seated himself at the\nsupper-table with the others. But Tarras-Briukhan\xe2\x80\x99s wife objected to\nthe smell of his clothes, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot eat with a fool; neither\ncan I stand the smell.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThen Tarras-Briukhan said: \xe2\x80\x9cIvan, from your clothes there comes a bad\nsmell; go and eat by yourself in the porch.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivan; and he took some bread and went out as ordered,\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is time for me to feed my mare.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\nThe small devil who had charge of Tarras finished with him that night,\nand according to agreement proceeded to the assistance of the other two\nto help them conquer Ivan. Arriving at the plowed field he looked\naround for his comrades, but found only the hole through which one had\ndisappeared; and on going to the meadow he discovered the severed tail\nof the other, and in the rye-field he found yet another hole.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cit is quite clear that my comrades have met with\nsome great misfortune, and that I will have to take their places and\narrange the feud between the brothers.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe small devil then went in search of Ivan. But he, having finished\nwith the field, was nowhere to be found. He had gone to the forest to\ncut logs to build homes for his brothers, as they found it inconvenient\nfor so many to live under the same roof.\n\nThe small devil at last discovered his whereabouts, and going to the\nforest climbed into the branches of the trees and began to interfere\nwith Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s work. Ivan cut down a tree, which failed, however, to fall\nto the ground, becoming entangled in the branches of other trees; yet\nhe succeeded in getting it down after a hard struggle. In chopping down\nthe next tree he met with the same difficulties, and also with the\nthird. Ivan had supposed he could cut down fifty trees in a day, but he\nsucceeded in chopping but ten before darkness put an end to his labors\nfor a time. He was now exhausted, and, perspiring profusely, he sat\ndown alone in the woods to rest. He soon after resumed his work,\ncutting down one more tree; but the effort gave him a pain in his back,\nand he was obliged to rest again. Seeing this, the small devil was full\nof joy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cnow he is exhausted and will stop work, and I will\nrest also.\xe2\x80\x9d He then seated himself on some branches and rejoiced.\n\nIvan again arose, however, and, taking his axe, gave the tree a\nterrific blow from the opposite side, which felled it instantly to the\nground, carrying the little devil with it; and Ivan, proceeding to cut\nthe branches, found the devil alive. Very much astonished, Ivan\nexclaimed:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook you! Such nastiness! Are you again here?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am another one,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the devil. \xe2\x80\x9cI was with your brother\nTarras.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivan, \xe2\x80\x9cthat makes no difference; I will fix you.\xe2\x80\x9d And he\nwas about to strike him a blow with the axe when the devil pleaded:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not kill me, and whatever you wish you shall have.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can make for you all the money you wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan then told the devil he might proceed, whereupon the latter began\nto explain to him how he might become rich.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to Ivan, \xe2\x80\x9cthe leaves of this oak tree and rub them in\nyour hands, and the gold will fall to the ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan did as he was directed, and immediately the gold began to drop\nabout his feet; and he remarked:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis will be a fine trick to amuse the village boys with.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I now take my departure?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the devil, to which Ivan replied,\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith God\xe2\x80\x99s blessing you may go.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt the mention of the name of God, the devil disappeared into the\nearth.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\nThe brothers, having finished their houses, moved into them and lived\napart from their father and brother. Ivan, when he had completed his\nplowing, made a great feast, to which he invited his brothers, telling\nthem that he had plenty of beer for them to drink. The brothers,\nhowever, declined Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s hospitality, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWe have seen the beer\nmoujiks drink, and want none of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan then gathered around him all the peasants in the village and with\nthem drank beer until he became intoxicated, when he joined the\n_Khorovody_ (a street gathering of the village boys and girls, who sing\nsongs), and told them they must sing his praises, saying that in return\nhe would show them such sights as they had never before seen in their\nlives. The little girls laughed and began to sing songs praising Ivan,\nand when they had finished they said: \xe2\x80\x9cVery well; now give us what you\nsaid you would.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI will soon show you,\xe2\x80\x9d and, taking an empty bag in his\nhand, he started for the woods. The little girls laughed as they said,\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fool he is!\xe2\x80\x9d and resuming their play they forgot all about him.\n\nSome time after Ivan suddenly appeared among them carrying in his hand\nthe bag, which was now filled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I divide this with you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; divide!\xe2\x80\x9d they sang in chorus.\n\nSo Ivan put his hand into the bag and drew it out full of gold coins,\nwhich he scattered among them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBatiushka,\xe2\x80\x9d they cried as they ran to gather up the precious pieces.\n\nThe moujiks then appeared on the scene and began to fight among\nthemselves for the possession of the yellow objects. In the m\xc3\xaal\xc3\xa9e one\nold woman was nearly crushed to death.\n\nIvan laughed and was greatly amused at the sight of so many persons\nquarrelling over a few pieces of gold.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you duratchki\xe2\x80\x9d (little fools), he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy did you almost crush\nthe life out of the old grandmother? Be more gentle. I have plenty\nmore, and I will give them to you;\xe2\x80\x9d whereupon he began throwing about\nmore of the coins.\n\nThe people gathered around him, and Ivan continued throwing until he\nemptied his bag. They clamored for more, but Ivan replied: \xe2\x80\x9cThe gold is\nall gone. Another time I will give you more. Now we will resume our\nsinging and dancing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe little children sang, but Ivan said to them, \xe2\x80\x9cYour songs are no\ngood.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe children said, \xe2\x80\x9cThen show us how to sing better.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTo this Ivan replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI will show you people who can sing better than\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d With that remark Ivan went to the barn and, securing a bundle of\nstraw, did as the little devil had directed him; and presently a\nregiment of soldiers appeared in the village street, and he ordered\nthem to sing and dance.\n\nThe people were astonished and could not understand how Ivan had\nproduced the strangers.\n\nThe soldiers sang for some time, to the great delight of the villagers;\nand when Ivan commanded them to stop they instantly ceased.\n\nIvan then ordered them off to the barn, telling the astonished and\nmystified moujiks that they must not follow him. Reaching the barn, he\nturned the soldiers again into straw and went home to sleep off the\neffects of his debauch.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\nThe next morning Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s exploits were the talk of the village, and news\nof the wonderful things he had done reached the ears of his brother\nSimeon, who immediately went to Ivan to learn all about it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cExplain to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cfrom whence did you bring the soldiers, and\nwhere did you take them?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do you wish to know for?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ivan.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, with soldiers we can do almost anything we wish\xe2\x80\x94whole kingdoms\ncan be conquered,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Simeon.\n\nThis information greatly surprised Ivan, who said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, why did you\nnot tell me about this before? I can make as many as you want.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan then took his brother to the barn, but he said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhile I am\nwilling to create the soldiers, you must take them away from here; for\nif it should become necessary to feed them, all the food in the village\nwould last them only one day.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSimeon promised to do as Ivan wished, whereupon Ivan proceeded to\nconvert the straw into soldiers. Out of one bundle of straw he made an\nentire regiment; in fact, so many soldiers appeared as if by magic that\nthere was not a vacant spot in the field.\n\nTurning to Simeon Ivan said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, is there a sufficient number?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBeaming with joy, Simeon replied: \xe2\x80\x9cEnough! enough! Thank you, Ivan!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlad you are satisfied,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivan, \xe2\x80\x9cand if you wish more I will make\nthem for you. I have plenty of straw now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSimeon divided his soldiers into battalions and regiments, and after\nhaving drilled them he went forth to fight and to conquer.\n\nSimeon had just gotten safely out of the village with his soldiers when\nTarras, the other brother, appeared before Ivan\xe2\x80\x94he also having heard of\nthe previous day\xe2\x80\x99s performance and wanting to learn the secret of his\npower. He sought Ivan, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cTell me the secret of your supply of\ngold, for if I had plenty of money I could with its assistance gather\nin all the wealth in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan was greatly surprised on hearing this statement, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\nmight have told me this before, for I can obtain for you as much money\nas you wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTarras was delighted, and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou might get me about three\nbushels.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivan, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will go to the woods, or, better still, we will\nharness the horse, as we could not possibly carry so much money\nourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe brothers went to the woods and Ivan proceeded to gather the oak\nleaves, which he rubbed between his hands, the dust falling to the\nground and turning into gold pieces as quickly as it fell.\n\nWhen quite a pile had accumulated Ivan turned to Tarras and asked if he\nhad rubbed enough leaves into money, whereupon Tarras replied: \xe2\x80\x9cThank\nyou, Ivan; that will be sufficient for this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan then said: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you wish more, come to me and I will rub as much as\nyou want, for there are plenty of leaves.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTarras, with his _tarantas_ (wagon) filled with gold, rode away to the\ncity to engage in trade and increase his wealth; and thus both brothers\nwent their way, Simeon to fight and Tarras to trade.\n\nSimeon\xe2\x80\x99s soldiers conquered a kingdom for him and Tarras-Briukhan made\nplenty of money.\n\nSome time afterward the two brothers met and confessed to each other\nthe source from whence sprang their prosperity, but they were not yet\nsatisfied.\n\nSimeon said: \xe2\x80\x9cI have conquered a kingdom and enjoy a very pleasant\nlife, but I have not sufficient money to procure food for my soldiers;\xe2\x80\x9d\nwhile Tarras confessed that he was the possessor of enormous wealth,\nbut the care of it caused him much uneasiness.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go again to our brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Simeon; \xe2\x80\x9cI will order him to\nmake more soldiers and will give them to you, and you may then tell him\nthat he must make more money so that we can buy food for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey went again to Ivan, and Simeon said: \xe2\x80\x9cI have not sufficient\nsoldiers; I want you to make me at least two divisions more.\xe2\x80\x9d But Ivan\nshook his head as he said: \xe2\x80\x9cI will not create soldiers for nothing; you\nmust pay me for doing it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but you promised,\xe2\x80\x9d said Simeon.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know I did,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ivan; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have changed my mind since that\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, fool, why will you not do as you promised?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the reason that your soldiers kill men, and I will not make any\nmore for such a cruel purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d With this reply Ivan remained stubborn\nand would not create any more soldiers.\n\nTarras-Briukhan next approached Ivan and ordered him to make more\nmoney; but, as in the case of Tarras, Ivan only shook his head, as he\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cI will not make you any money unless you pay me for doing it. I\ncannot work without pay.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTarras then reminded him of his promise.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know I promised,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ivan; \xe2\x80\x9cbut still I must refuse to do as\nyou wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why, fool, will you not fulfill your promise?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Tarras.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the reason that your gold was the means of depriving Mikhailovna\nof her cow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how did that happen?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Tarras.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt happened in this way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivan. \xe2\x80\x9cMikhailovna always kept a cow,\nand her children had plenty of milk to drink; but some time ago one of\nher boys came to me to beg for some milk, and I asked, \xe2\x80\x98Where is your\ncow?\xe2\x80\x99 when he replied, \xe2\x80\x98A clerk of Tarras-Briukhan came to our home and\noffered three gold pieces for her. Our mother could not resist the\ntemptation, and now we have no milk to drink. I gave you the gold\npieces for your pleasure, and you put them to such poor use that I will\nnot give you any more.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe brothers, on hearing this, took their departure to discuss as to\nthe best plan to pursue in regard to a settlement of their troubles.\n\nSimeon said: \xe2\x80\x9cLet us arrange it in this way: I will give you the half\nof my kingdom, and soldiers to keep guard over your wealth; and you\ngive me money to feed the soldiers in my half of the kingdom.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTo this arrangement Tarras agreed, and both the brothers became rulers\nand very happy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\nIvan remained on the farm and worked to support his father, mother, and\ndumb sister. Once it happened that the old dog, which had grown up on\nthe farm, was taken sick, when Ivan thought he was dying, and, taking\npity on the animal, placed some bread in his hat and carried it to him.\nIt happened that when he turned out the bread the root which the little\ndevil had given him fell out also. The old dog swallowed it with the\nbread and was almost instantly cured, when he jumped up and began to\nwag his tail as an expression of joy. Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s father and mother, seeing\nthe dog cured so quickly, asked by what means he had performed such a\nmiracle.\n\nIvan replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI had some roots which would cure any disease, and the\ndog swallowed one of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt happened about that time that the Czar\xe2\x80\x99s daughter became ill, and\nher father had it announced in every city, town, and village that\nwhosoever would cure her would be richly rewarded; and if the lucky\nperson should prove to be a single man he would give her in marriage to\nhim.\n\nThis announcement, of course, appeared in Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s village.\n\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s father and mother called him and said: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you have any of those\nwonderful roots, go and cure the Czar\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. You will be much\nhappier for having performed such a kind act\xe2\x80\x94indeed, you will be made\nhappy for all your after life.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivan; and he immediately made ready for the journey.\nAs he reached the porch on his way out he saw a poor woman standing\ndirectly in his path and holding a broken arm. The woman accosted him,\nsaying:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was told that you could cure me, and will you not please do so, as I\nam powerless to do anything for myself?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan replied: \xe2\x80\x9cVery well, my poor woman; I will relieve you if I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe produced a root which he handed to the poor woman and told her to\nswallow it.\n\nShe did as Ivan told her and was instantly cured, and went away\nrejoicing that she had recovered the use of her arm.\n\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s father and mother came out to wish him good luck on his journey,\nand to them he told the story of the poor woman, saying that he had\ngiven her his last root. On hearing this his parents were much\ndistressed, as they now believed him to be without the means of curing\nthe Czar\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, and began to scold him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had pity for a beggar and gave no thought to the Czar\xe2\x80\x99s daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d\nthey said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have pity for the Czar\xe2\x80\x99s daughter also,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ivan, after which\nhe harnessed his horse to his wagon and took his seat ready for his\ndeparture; whereupon his parents said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going, you\nfool\xe2\x80\x94to cure the Czar\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, and without anything to do it with?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ivan, as he drove away.\n\nIn due time he arrived at the palace, and the moment he appeared on the\nbalcony the Czar\xe2\x80\x99s daughter was cured. The Czar was overjoyed and\nordered Ivan to be brought into his presence. He dressed him in the\nrichest robes and addressed him as his son-in-law. Ivan was married to\nthe Czarevna, and, the Czar dying soon after, Ivan became ruler. Thus\nthe three brothers became rulers in different kingdoms.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n\nThe brothers lived and reigned. Simeon, the eldest brother, with his\nstraw soldiers took captive the genuine soldiers and trained all alike.\nHe was feared by every one.\n\nTarras-Briukhan, the other brother, did not squander the gold he\nobtained from Ivan, but instead greatly increased his wealth, and at\nthe same time lived well. He kept his money in large trunks, and, while\nhaving more than he knew what to do with, still continued to collect\nmoney from his subjects. The people had to work for the money to pay\nthe taxes which Tarras levied on them, and life was made burdensome to\nthem.\n\nIvan the Fool did not enjoy his wealth and power to the same extent as\ndid his brothers. As soon as his father-in-law, the late Czar, was\nburied, he discarded the Imperial robes which had fallen to him and\ntold his wife to put them away, as he had no further use for them.\nHaving cast aside the insignia of his rank, he once more donned his\npeasant garb and started to work as of old.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI felt lonesome,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand began to grow enormously stout, and\nyet I had no appetite, and neither could I sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan sent for his father, mother, and dumb sister, and brought them to\nlive with him, and they worked with him at whatever he chose to do.\n\nThe people soon learned that Ivan was a fool. His wife one day said to\nhim, \xe2\x80\x9cThe people say you are a fool, Ivan.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let them think so if they wish,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied.\n\nHis wife pondered this reply for some time, and at last decided that if\nIvan was a fool she also was one, and that it would be useless to go\ncontrary to her husband, thinking affectionately of the old proverb\nthat \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the needle goes there goes the thread also.\xe2\x80\x9d She therefore\ncast aside her magnificent robes, and, putting them into the trunk with\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s, dressed herself in cheap clothing and joined her dumb\nsister-in-law, with the intention of learning to work. She succeeded so\nwell that she soon became a great help to Ivan.\n\nSeeing that Ivan was a fool, all the wise men left the kingdom and only\nthe fools remained. They had no money, their wealth consisting only of\nthe products of their labor. But they lived peacefully together,\nsupported themselves in comfort, and had plenty to spare for the needy\nand afflicted.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n\nThe old devil grew tired of waiting for the good news which he expected\nthe little devils to bring him. He waited in vain to hear of the ruin\nof the brothers, so he went in search of the emissaries which he had\nsent to perform that work for him. After looking around for some time,\nand seeing nothing but the three holes in the ground, he decided that\nthey had not succeeded in their work and that he would have to do it\nhimself.\n\nThe old devil next went in search of the brothers, but he could learn\nnothing of their whereabouts. After some time he found them in their\ndifferent kingdoms, contented and happy. This greatly incensed the old\ndevil, and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI will now have to accomplish their mission\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe first visited Simeon the soldier, and appeared before him as a\n_voyevoda_ (general), saying: \xe2\x80\x9cYou, Simeon, are a great warrior, and I\nalso have had considerable experience in warfare, and am desirous of\nserving you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSimeon questioned the disguised devil, and seeing that he was an\nintelligent man took him into his service.\n\nThe new General taught Simeon how to strengthen his army until it\nbecame very powerful. New implements of warfare were introduced.\n\nCannons capable of throwing one hundred balls a minute were also\nconstructed, and these, it was expected, would be of deadly effect in\nbattle.\n\nSimeon, on the advice of his new General, ordered all young men above a\ncertain age to report for drill. On the same advice Simeon established\ngun-shops, where immense numbers of cannons and rifles were made.\n\nThe next move of the new General was to have Simeon declare war against\nthe neighboring kingdom. This he did, and with his immense army marched\ninto the adjoining territory, which he pillaged and burned, destroying\nmore than half the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s soldiers. This so frightened the ruler of\nthat country that he willingly gave up half of his kingdom to save the\nother half.\n\nSimeon, overjoyed at his success, declared his intention of marching\ninto Indian territory and subduing the Viceroy of that country.\n\nBut Simeon\xe2\x80\x99s intentions reached the ears of the Indian ruler, who\nprepared to do battle with him. In addition to having secured all the\nlatest implements of warfare, he added still others of his own\ninvention. He ordered all boys over fourteen and all single women to be\ndrafted into the army, until its proportions became much larger than\nSimeon\xe2\x80\x99s. His cannons and rifles were of the same pattern as Simeon\xe2\x80\x99s,\nand he invented a flying-machine from which bombs could be thrown into\nthe enemy\xe2\x80\x99s camp.\n\nSimeon went forth to conquer the Viceroy with full confidence in his\nown powers to succeed. This time luck forsook him, and instead of being\nthe conqueror he was himself conquered.\n\nThe Indian ruler had so arranged his army that Simeon could not even\nget within shooting distance, while the bombs from the flying-machine\ncarried destruction and terror in their path, completely routing his\narmy, so that Simeon was left alone.\n\nThe Viceroy took possession of his kingdom and Simeon had to fly for\nhis life.\n\nHaving finished with Simeon, the old devil next approached Tarras. He\nappeared before him disguised as one of the merchants of his kingdom,\nand established factories and began to make money. The \xe2\x80\x9cmerchant\xe2\x80\x9d paid\nthe highest price for everything he purchased, and the people ran after\nhim to sell their goods. Through this \xe2\x80\x9cmerchant\xe2\x80\x9d they were enabled to\nmake plenty of money, paying up all their arrears of taxes as well as\nthe others when they came due.\n\nTarras was overjoyed at this condition of affairs and said: \xe2\x80\x9cThanks to\nthis merchant, now I will have more money than before, and life will be\nmuch pleasanter for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe wished to erect new buildings, and advertised for workmen, offering\nthe highest prices for all kinds of labor. Tarras thought the people\nwould be as anxious to work as formerly, but instead he was much\nsurprised to learn that they were working for the \xe2\x80\x9cmerchant.\xe2\x80\x9d Thinking\nto induce them to leave the \xe2\x80\x9cmerchant,\xe2\x80\x9d he increased his offers, but\nthe former, equal to the emergency, also raised the wages of his\nworkmen. Tarras, having plenty of money, increased the offers still\nmore; but the \xe2\x80\x9cmerchant\xe2\x80\x9d raised them still higher and got the better of\nhim. Thus, defeated at every point, Tarras was compelled to abandon the\nidea of building.\n\nTarras next announced that he intended laying out gardens and erecting\nfountains, and the work was to be commenced in the fall, but no one\ncame to offer his services, and again he was obliged to forego his\nintentions. Winter set in, and Tarras wanted some sable fur with which\nto line his great-coat, and he sent his man to procure it for him; but\nthe servant returned without it, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cThere are no sables to be\nhad. The \xe2\x80\x98merchant\xe2\x80\x99 has bought them all, paying a very high price for\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTarras needed horses and sent a messenger to purchase them, but he\nreturned with the same story as on former occasions\xe2\x80\x94that none were to\nbe found, the \xe2\x80\x9cmerchant\xe2\x80\x9d having bought them all to carry water for an\nartificial pond he was constructing. Tarras was at last compelled to\nsuspend business, as he could not find any one willing to work for him.\nThey had all gone over to the \xe2\x80\x9cmerchant\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d side. The only dealings the\npeople had with Tarras were when they went to pay their taxes. His\nmoney accumulated so fast that he could not find a place to put it, and\nhis life became miserable. He abandoned all idea of entering upon the\nnew venture, and only thought of how to exist peaceably. This he found\nit difficult to do, for, turn which way he would, fresh obstacles\nconfronted him. Even his cooks, coachmen, and all his other servants\nforsook him and joined the \xe2\x80\x9cmerchant.\xe2\x80\x9d With all his wealth he had\nnothing to eat, and when he went to market he found the \xe2\x80\x9cmerchant\xe2\x80\x9d had\nbeen there before him and had bought up all the provisions. Still, the\npeople continued to bring him money.\n\nTarras at last became so indignant that he ordered the \xe2\x80\x9cmerchant\xe2\x80\x9d out\nof his kingdom. He left, but settled just outside the boundary line,\nand continued his business with the same result as before, and Tarras\nwas frequently forced to go without food for days. It was rumored that\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cmerchant\xe2\x80\x9d wanted to buy even Tarras himself. On hearing this the\nlatter became very much alarmed and could not decide as to the best\ncourse to pursue.\n\nAbout this time his brother Simeon arrived in the kingdom, and said:\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp me, for I have been defeated and ruined by the Indian Viceroy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTarras replied: \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I help you, when I have had no food myself for\ntwo days?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n\nThe old devil, having finished with the second brother, went to Ivan\nthe Fool. This time he disguised himself as a General, the same as in\nthe case of Simeon, and, appearing before Ivan, said: \xe2\x80\x9cGet an army\ntogether. It is disgraceful for the ruler of a kingdom to be without an\narmy. You call your people to assemble, and I will form them into a\nfine large army.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan took the supposed General\xe2\x80\x99s advice, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you may form\nmy people into an army, but you must also teach them to sing the songs\nI like.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old devil then went through Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom to secure recruits for\nthe army, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cCome, shave your heads [the heads of recruits are\nalways shaved in Russia] and I will give each of you a red hat and\nplenty of vodka\xe2\x80\x9d (whiskey).\n\nAt this the fools only laughed, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe can have all the vodka we\nwant, for we distill it ourselves; and of hats, our little girls make\nall we want, of any color we please, and with handsome fringes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThus was the devil foiled in securing recruits for his army; so he\nreturned to Ivan and said: \xe2\x80\x9cYour fools will not volunteer to be\nsoldiers. It will therefore be necessary to force them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ivan, \xe2\x80\x9cyou may use force if you want to.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old devil then announced that all the fools must become soldiers,\nand those who refused, Ivan would punish with death.\n\nThe fools went to the General; and said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou tell us that Ivan will\npunish with death all those who refuse to become soldiers, but you have\nomitted to state what will be done with us soldiers. We have been told\nthat we are only to be killed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is true,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply.\n\nThe fools on hearing this became stubborn and refused to go.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter kill us now if we cannot avoid death, but we will not become\nsoldiers,\xe2\x80\x9d they declared.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you fools,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old devil, \xe2\x80\x9csoldiers may and may not be\nkilled; but if you disobey Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s orders you will find certain death at\nhis hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe fools remained absorbed in thought for some time and finally went\nto Ivan to question him in regard to the matter.\n\nOn arriving at his house they said: \xe2\x80\x9cA General came to us with an order\nfrom you that we were all to become soldiers, and if we refused you\nwere to punish us with death. Is it true?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan began to laugh heartily on hearing this, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, how I\nalone can punish you with death is something I cannot understand. If I\nwas not a fool myself I would be able to explain it to you, but as it\nis I cannot.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, we will not go,\xe2\x80\x9d they said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ivan, \xe2\x80\x9cyou need not become soldiers unless you\nwish to.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old devil, seeing his schemes about to prove failures, went to the\nruler of Tarakania and became his friend, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cLet us go and\nconquer Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom. He has no money, but he has plenty of cattle,\nprovisions, and various other things that would be useful to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Tarakanian ruler gathered his large army together, and equipping it\nwith cannons and rifles, crossed the boundary line into Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom.\nThe people went to Ivan and said: \xe2\x80\x9cThe ruler of Tarakania is here with\na large army to fight us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet them come,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ivan.\n\nThe Tarakanian ruler, after crossing the line into Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom,\nlooked in vain for soldiers to fight against; and waiting some time and\nnone appearing, he sent his own warriors to attack the villages.\n\nThey soon reached the first village, which they began to plunder.\n\nThe fools of both sexes looked calmly on, offering not the least\nresistance when their cattle and provisions were being taken from them.\nOn the contrary, they invited the soldiers to come and live with them,\nsaying: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you, dear friends, find it is difficult to earn a living in\nyour own land, come and live with us, where everything is plentiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe soldiers decided to remain, finding the people happy and\nprosperous, with enough surplus food to supply many of their neighbors.\nThey were surprised at the cordial greetings which they everywhere\nreceived, and, returning to the ruler of Tarakania, they said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\ncannot fight with these people\xe2\x80\x94take us to another place. We would much\nprefer the dangers of actual warfare to this unsoldierly method of\nsubduing the village.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Tarakanian ruler, becoming enraged, ordered the soldiers to destroy\nthe whole kingdom, plunder the villages, burn the houses and\nprovisions, and slaughter the cattle.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould you disobey my orders,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI will have every one of you\nexecuted.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe soldiers, becoming frightened, started to do as they were ordered,\nbut the fools wept bitterly, offering no resistance, men, women, and\nchildren all joining in the general lamentation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you treat us so cruelly?\xe2\x80\x9d they cried to the invading soldiers.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you wish to destroy everything we have? If you have more need\nof these things than we have, why not take them with you and leave us\nin peace?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe soldiers, becoming saddened with remorse, refused further to pursue\ntheir path of destruction\xe2\x80\x94the entire army scattering in many\ndirections.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\n\nThe old devil, failing to ruin Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom with soldiers,\ntransformed himself into a nobleman, dressed exquisitely, and became\none of Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s subjects, with the intention of compassing the downfall\nof his kingdom\xe2\x80\x94as he had done with that of Tarras.\n\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cnobleman\xe2\x80\x9d said to Ivan: \xe2\x80\x9cI desire to teach you wisdom and to\nrender you other service. I will build you a palace and factories.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivan; \xe2\x80\x9cyou may live with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe next day the \xe2\x80\x9cnobleman\xe2\x80\x9d appeared on the Square with a sack of gold\nin his hand and a plan for building a house, saying to the people: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\nare living like pigs, and I am going to teach you how to live decently.\nYou are to build a house for me according to this plan. I will\nsuperintend the work myself, and will pay you for your services in\ngold,\xe2\x80\x9d showing them at the same time the contents of his sack.\n\nThe fools were amused. They had never before seen any money. Their\nbusiness was conducted entirely by exchange of farm products or by\nhiring themselves out to work by the day in return for whatever they\nmost needed. They therefore glanced at the gold pieces with amazement,\nand said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat nice toys they would be to play with!\xe2\x80\x9d In return for\nthe gold they gave their services and brought the \xe2\x80\x9cnobleman\xe2\x80\x9d the\nproduce of their farms.\n\nThe old devil was overjoyed as he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cNow my enterprise is on a\nfair road and I will be able to ruin the Fool\xe2\x80\x94as I did his brothers.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe fools obtained sufficient gold to distribute among the entire\ncommunity, the women and young girls of the village wearing much of it\nas ornaments, while to the children they gave some pieces to play with\non the streets.\n\nWhen they had secured all they wanted they stopped working and the\n\xe2\x80\x9cnobleman\xe2\x80\x9d did not get his house more than half finished. He had\nneither provisions nor cattle for the year, and ordered the people to\nbring him both. He directed them also to go on with the building of the\npalace and factories. He promised to pay them liberally in gold for\neverything they did. No one responded to his call\xe2\x80\x94only once in awhile a\nlittle boy or girl would call to exchange eggs for his gold.\n\nThus was the \xe2\x80\x9cnobleman\xe2\x80\x9d deserted, and, having nothing to eat, he went\nto the village to procure some provisions for his dinner. He went to\none house and offered gold in return for a chicken, but was refused,\nthe owner saying: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have enough of that already and do not want any\nmore.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe next went to a fish-woman to buy some herring, when she, too,\nrefused to accept his gold in return for fish, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cI do not wish\nit, my dear man; I have no children to whom I can give it to play with.\nI have three pieces which I keep as curiosities only.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe then went to a peasant to buy bread, but he also refused to accept\nthe gold. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no use for it,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cunless you wish to give it\nfor Christ\xe2\x80\x99s sake; then it will be a different matter, and I will tell\nmy _baba_ [old woman] to cut a piece of bread for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old devil was so angry that he ran away from the peasant, spitting\nand cursing as he went.\n\nNot only did the offer to accept in the name of Christ anger him, but\nthe very mention of the name was like the thrust of a knife in his\nthroat.\n\nThe old devil did not succeed in getting any bread, and in his efforts\nto secure other articles of food he met with the same failure. The\npeople had all the gold they wanted and what pieces they had they\nregarded as curiosities. They said to the old devil: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you bring us\nsomething else in exchange for food, or come to ask for Christ\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\nwe will give you all you want.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut the old devil had nothing but gold, and was too lazy to work; and\nbeing unable to accept anything for Christ\xe2\x80\x99s sake, he was greatly\nenraged.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat else do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI will give you gold with which you\ncan buy everything you want, and you need labor no longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut the fools would not accept his gold, nor listen to him. Thus the\nold devil was obliged to go to sleep hungry.\n\nTidings of this condition of affairs soon reached the ears of Ivan. The\npeople went to him and said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall we do? This nobleman appeared\namong us; he is well dressed; he wishes to eat and drink of the best,\nbut is unwilling to work, and does not beg for food for Christ\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\nHe only offers every one gold pieces. At first we gave him everything\nhe wanted, taking the gold pieces in exchange just as curiosities; but\nnow we have enough of them and refuse to accept any more from him. What\nshall we do with him? he may die of hunger!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan heard all they had to say, and told them to employ him as a\nshepherd, taking turns in doing so.\n\nThe old devil saw no other way out of the difficulty and was obliged to\nsubmit.\n\nIt soon came the old devil\xe2\x80\x99s turn to go to Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s house. He went there\nto dinner and found Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s dumb sister preparing the meal. She was\noften cheated by the lazy people, who while they did not work, yet ate\nup all the gruel. But she learned to know the lazy people from the\ncondition of their hands. Those with great welts on their hands she\ninvited first to the table, and those having smooth white hands had to\ntake what was left.\n\nThe old devil took a seat at the table, but the dumb girl, taking his\nhands, looked at them, and seeing them white and clean, and with long\nnails, swore at him and put him from the table.\n\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s wife said to the old devil: \xe2\x80\x9cYou must excuse my sister-in-law;\nshe will not allow any one to sit at the table whose hands have not\nbeen hardened by toil, so you will have to wait until the dinner is\nover and then you can have what is left. With it you must be\nsatisfied.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old devil was very much offended that he was made to eat with\n\xe2\x80\x9cpigs,\xe2\x80\x9d as he expressed it, and complained to Ivan, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cThe\nfoolish law you have in your kingdom, that all persons must work, is\nsurely the invention of fools. People who work for a living are not\nalways forced to labor with their hands. Do you think wise men labor\nso?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan replied: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what do fools know about it? We all work with our\nhands.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd for that reason you are fools,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the devil. \xe2\x80\x9cI can teach\nyou how to use your brains, and you will find such labor more\nbeneficial.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan was surprised at hearing this, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it is perhaps not\nwithout good reason that we are called fools.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not so easy to work with the brain,\xe2\x80\x9d the old devil said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\nwill not give me anything to eat because my hands have not the\nappearance of being toil-hardened, but you must understand that it is\nmuch harder to do brain-work, and sometimes the head feels like\nbursting with the effort it is forced to make.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why do you not select some light work that you can perform with\nyour hands?\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan asked.\n\nThe devil said: \xe2\x80\x9cI torment myself with brain-work because I have pity\nfor you fools, for, if I did not torture myself, people like you would\nremain fools for all eternity. I have exercised my brain a great deal\nduring my life, and now I am able to teach you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan was greatly surprised and said: \xe2\x80\x9cVery well; teach us, so that when\nour hands are tired we can use our heads to replace them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe devil promised to instruct the people, and Ivan announced the fact\nthroughout his kingdom.\n\nThe devil was willing to teach all those who came to him how to use the\nhead instead of the hands, so as to produce more with the former than\nwith the latter.\n\nIn Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom there was a high tower, which was reached by a long,\nnarrow ladder leading up to the balcony, and Ivan told the old devil\nthat from the top of the tower every one could see him.\n\nSo the old devil went up to the balcony and addressed the people.\n\nThe fools came in great crowds to hear what the old devil had to say,\nthinking that he really meant to tell them how to work with the head.\nBut the old devil only told them in words what to do, and did not give\nthem any practical instruction. He said that men working only with\ntheir hands could not make a living. The fools did not understand what\nhe said to them and looked at him in amazement, and then departed for\ntheir daily work.\n\nThe old devil addressed them for two days from the balcony, and at the\nend of that time, feeling hungry, he asked the people to bring him some\nbread. But they only laughed at him and told him if he could work\nbetter with his head than with his hands he could also find bread for\nhimself. He addressed the people for yet another day, and they went to\nhear him from curiosity, but soon left him to return to their work.\n\nIvan asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, did the nobleman work with his head?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet,\xe2\x80\x9d they said; \xe2\x80\x9cso far he has only talked.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOne day, while the old devil was standing on the balcony, he became\nweak, and, falling down, hurt his head against a pole.\n\nSeeing this, one of the fools ran to Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s wife and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe\ngentleman has at last commenced to work with his head.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe ran to the field to tell Ivan, who was much surprised, and said,\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go and see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe turned his horses\xe2\x80\x99 heads in the direction of the tower, where the\nold devil remained weak from hunger and was still suspended from the\npole, with his body swaying back and forth and his head striking the\nlower part of the pole each time it came in contact with it. While Ivan\nwas looking, the old devil started down the steps head-first\xe2\x80\x94as they\nsupposed, to count them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivan, \xe2\x80\x9che told the truth after all\xe2\x80\x94that sometimes from\nthis kind of work the head bursts. This is far worse than welts on the\nhands.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old devil fell to the ground head-foremost. Ivan approached him,\nbut at that instant the ground opened and the devil disappeared,\nleaving only a hole to show where he had gone.\n\nIvan scratched his head and said: \xe2\x80\x9cSee here; such nastiness! This is\nyet another devil. He looks like the father of the little ones.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan still lives, and people flock to his kingdom. His brothers come to\nhim and he feeds them.\n\nTo every one who comes to him and says, \xe2\x80\x9cGive us food,\xe2\x80\x9d he replies:\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; you are welcome. We have plenty of everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThere is only one unchangeable custom observed in Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom: The\nman with toil-hardened hands is always given a seat at the table, while\nthe possessor of soft white hands must be contented with what is left.\n\n\n\n\nA LOST OPPORTUNITY.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen came Peter to Him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin\nagainst me, and I forgive him? till seven times?\xe2\x80\x9d . . . . \xe2\x80\x9cSo likewise\nshall My heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts\nforgive not every one his brother their trespasses.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94ST. MATTHEW\nxviii., 21-35.\n\n\nIn a certain village there lived a peasant by the name of Ivan\nScherbakoff. He was prosperous, strong, and vigorous, and was\nconsidered the hardest worker in the whole village. He had three sons,\nwho supported themselves by their own labor. The eldest was married,\nthe second about to be married, and the youngest took care of the\nhorses and occasionally attended to the plowing.\n\nThe peasant\xe2\x80\x99s wife, Ivanovna, was intelligent and industrious, while\nher daughter-in-law was a simple, quiet soul, but a hard worker.\n\nThere was only one idle person in the household, and that was Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s\nfather, a very old man who for seven years had suffered from asthma,\nand who spent the greater part of his time lying on the brick oven.\n\nIvan had plenty of everything\xe2\x80\x94three horses, with one colt, a cow with\ncalf, and fifteen sheep. The women made the men\xe2\x80\x99s clothes, and in\naddition to performing all the necessary household labor, also worked\nin the field; while the men\xe2\x80\x99s industry was confined altogether to the\nfarm.\n\nWhat was left of the previous year\xe2\x80\x99s supply of provisions was ample for\ntheir needs, and they sold a quantity of oats sufficient to pay their\ntaxes and other expenses.\n\nThus life went smoothly for Ivan.\n\nThe peasant\xe2\x80\x99s next-door neighbor was a son of Gordey Ivanoff, called\n\xe2\x80\x9cGavryl the Lame.\xe2\x80\x9d It once happened that Ivan had a quarrel with him;\nbut while old man Gordey was yet alive, and Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s father was the head\nof the household, the two peasants lived as good neighbors should. If\nthe women of one house required the use of a sieve or pail, they\nborrowed it from the inmates of the other house. The same condition of\naffairs existed between the men. They lived more like one family, the\none dividing his possessions with the other, and perfect harmony\nreigned between the two families.\n\nIf a stray calf or cow invaded the garden of one of the farmers, the\nother willingly drove it away, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cBe careful, neighbor, that your\nstock does not again stray into my garden; we should put a fence up.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn the same way they had no secrets from each other. The doors of their\nhouses and barns had neither bolts nor locks, so sure were they of each\nother\xe2\x80\x99s honesty. Not a shadow of suspicion darkened their daily\nintercourse.\n\nThus lived the old people.\n\nIn time the younger members of the two households started farming. It\nsoon became apparent that they would not get along as peacefully as the\nold people had done, for they began quarrelling without the slightest\nprovocation.\n\nA hen belonging to Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s daughter-in-law commenced laying eggs, which\nthe young woman collected each morning, intending to keep them for the\nEaster holidays. She made daily visits to the barn, where, under an old\nwagon, she was sure to find the precious egg.\n\nOne day the children frightened the hen and she flew over their\nneighbor\xe2\x80\x99s fence and laid her egg in their garden.\n\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s daughter-in-law heard the hen cackling, but said: \xe2\x80\x9cI am very\nbusy just at present, for this is the eve of a holy day, and I must\nclean and arrange this room. I will go for the egg later on.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen evening came, and she had finished her task, she went to the barn,\nand as usual looked under the old wagon, expecting to find an egg. But,\nalas! no egg was visible in the accustomed place.\n\nGreatly disappointed, she returned to the house and inquired of her\nmother-in-law and the other members of the family if they had taken it.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d they said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe know nothing of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTaraska, the youngest brother-in-law, coming in soon after, she also\ninquired of him if he knew anything about the missing egg. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nreplied; \xe2\x80\x9cyour pretty, crested hen laid her egg in our neighbors\xe2\x80\x99\ngarden, and after she had finished cackling she flew back again over\nthe fence.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe young woman, greatly surprised on hearing this, turned and looked\nlong and seriously at the hen, which was sitting with closed eyes\nbeside the rooster in the chimney-corner. She asked the hen where it\nlaid the egg. At the sound of her voice it simply opened and closed its\neyes, but could make no answer.\n\nShe then went to the neighbors\xe2\x80\x99 house, where she was met by an old\nwoman, who said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want, young woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s daughter-in-law replied: \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, _babushka_ [grandmother], my\nhen flew into your yard this morning. Did she not lay an egg there?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe did not see any,\xe2\x80\x9d the old woman replied; \xe2\x80\x9cwe have our own hens\xe2\x80\x94God\nbe praised!\xe2\x80\x94and they have been laying for this long time. We hunt only\nfor the eggs our own hens lay, and have no use for the eggs other\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s hens lay. Another thing I want to tell you, young woman: we do\nnot go into other people\xe2\x80\x99s yards to look for eggs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNow this speech greatly angered the young woman, and she replied in the\nsame spirit in which she had been spoken to, only using much stronger\nlanguage and speaking at greater length.\n\nThe neighbor replied in the same angry manner, and finally the women\nbegan to abuse each other and call vile names. It happened that old\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s wife, on her way to the well for water, heard the dispute, and\njoined the others, taking her daughter-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s part.\n\nGavryl\xe2\x80\x99s housekeeper, hearing the noise, could not resist the\ntemptation to join the rest and to make her voice heard. As soon as she\nappeared on the scene, she, too, began to abuse her neighbor, reminding\nher of many disagreeable things which had happened (and many which had\nnot happened) between them. She became so infuriated during her\ndenunciations that she lost all control of herself, and ran around like\nsome mad creature.\n\nThen all the women began to shout at the same time, each trying to say\ntwo words to another\xe2\x80\x99s one, and using the vilest language in the\nquarreller\xe2\x80\x99s vocabulary.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are such and such,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted one of the women. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a thief, a\n_schlukha_ [a mean, dirty, low creature]; your father-in-law is even\nnow starving, and you have no shame. You beggar, you borrowed my sieve\nand broke it. You made a large hole in it, and did not buy me another.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have our scale-beam,\xe2\x80\x9d cried another woman, \xe2\x80\x9cand must give it back\nto me;\xe2\x80\x9d whereupon she seized the scale-beam and tried to remove it from\nthe shoulders of Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\n\nIn the m\xc3\xaal\xc3\xa9e which followed they upset the pails of water. They tore\nthe covering from each other\xe2\x80\x99s head, and a general fight ensued.\n\nGavryl\xe2\x80\x99s wife had by this time joined in the fracas, and he, crossing\nthe field and seeing the trouble, came to her rescue.\n\nIvan and his son, seeing that their womenfolk were being badly used,\njumped into the midst of the fray, and a fearful fight followed.\n\nIvan was the most powerful peasant in all the country round, and it did\nnot take him long to disperse the crowd, for they flew in all\ndirections. During the progress of the fight Ivan tore out a large\nquantity of Gavryl\xe2\x80\x99s beard.\n\nBy this time a large crowd of peasants had collected, and it was with\nthe greatest difficulty that they persuaded the two families to stop\nquarrelling.\n\nThis was the beginning.\n\nGavryl took the portion of his beard which Ivan had torn out, and,\nwrapping it in a paper, went to the _volostnoye_ (moujiks\xe2\x80\x99 court) and\nentered a complaint against Ivan.\n\nHolding up the hair, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI did not grow this for that bear Ivan\nto tear out!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nGavryl\xe2\x80\x99s wife went round among the neighbors, telling them that they\nmust not repeat what she told them, but that she and her husband were\ngoing to get the best of Ivan, and that he was to be sent to Siberia.\n\nAnd so the quarrelling went on.\n\nThe poor old grandfather, sick with asthma and lying on the brick oven\nall the time, tried from the first to dissuade them from quarrelling,\nand begged of them to live in peace; but they would not listen to his\ngood advice. He said to them: \xe2\x80\x9cYou children are making a great fuss and\nmuch trouble about nothing. I beg of you to stop and think of what a\nlittle thing has caused all this trouble. It has arisen from only one\negg. If our neighbors\xe2\x80\x99 children picked it up, it is all right. God\nbless them! One egg is of but little value, and without it God will\nsupply sufficient for all our needs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s daughter-in-law here interposed and said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut they called us\nvile names.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old grandfather again spoke, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, even if they _did_ call\nyou bad names, it would have been better to return good for evil, and\nby your example show them how to speak better. Such conduct on your\npart would have been best for all concerned.\xe2\x80\x9d He continued: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\nhad a fight, you wicked people. Such things sometimes happen, but it\nwould be better if you went afterward and asked forgiveness and buried\nyour grievances out of sight. Scatter them to the four winds of heaven,\nfor if you do not do so it will be the worse for you in the end.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe younger members of the family, still obstinate, refused to profit\nby the old man\xe2\x80\x99s advice, and declared he was not right, and that he\nonly liked to grumble in his old-fashioned way.\n\nIvan refused to go to his neighbor, as the grandfather wished, saying:\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not tear out Gavryl\xe2\x80\x99s beard. He did it himself, and his son tore\nmy shirt and trousers into shreds.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan entered suit against Gavryl. He first went to the village justice,\nand not getting satisfaction from him he carried his case to the\nvillage court.\n\nWhile the neighbors were wrangling over the affair, each suing the\nother, it happened that a perch-bolt from Gavryl\xe2\x80\x99s wagon was lost; and\nthe women of Gavryl\xe2\x80\x99s household accused Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s son of stealing it.\n\nThey said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe saw him in the night-time pass by our window, on his way\nto where the wagon was standing.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd my _kumushka_ [sponsor],\xe2\x80\x9d said\none of them, \xe2\x80\x9ctold me that Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s son had offered it for sale at the\n_kabak_ [tavern].\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis accusation caused them again to go into court for a settlement of\ntheir grievances.\n\nWhile the heads of the families were trying to have their troubles\nsettled in court, their home quarrels were constant, and frequently\nresulted in hand-to-hand encounters. Even the little children followed\nthe example of their elders and quarrelled incessantly.\n\nThe women, when they met on the riverbank to do the family washing,\ninstead of attending to their work passed the time in abusing each\nother, and not infrequently they came to blows.\n\nAt first the male members of the families were content with accusing\neach other of various crimes, such as stealing and like meannesses. But\nthe trouble in this mild form did not last long.\n\nThey soon resorted to other measures. They began to appropriate one\nanother\xe2\x80\x99s things without asking permission, while various articles\ndisappeared from both houses and could not be found. This was done out\nof revenge.\n\nThis example being set by the men, the women and children also\nfollowed, and life soon became a burden to all who took part in the\nstrife.\n\nIvan Scherbakoff and \xe2\x80\x9cGavryl the Lame\xe2\x80\x9d at last laid their trouble\nbefore the _mir_ (village meeting), in addition to having been in court\nand calling on the justice of the peace. Both of the latter had grown\ntired of them and their incessant wrangling. One time Gavryl would\nsucceed in having Ivan fined, and if he was not able to pay it he would\nbe locked up in the cold dreary prison for days. Then it would be\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s turn to get Gavryl punished in like manner, and the greater the\ninjury the one could do the other the more delight he took in it.\n\nThe success of either in having the other punished only served to\nincrease their rage against each other, until they were like mad dogs\nin their warfare.\n\nIf anything went wrong with one of them he immediately accused his\nadversary of conspiring to ruin him, and sought revenge without\nstopping to inquire into the rights of the case.\n\nWhen the peasants went into court, and had each other fined and\nimprisoned, it did not soften their hearts in the least. They would\nonly taunt one another on such occasions, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind; I will\nrepay you for all this.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis state of affairs lasted for six years.\n\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s father, the sick old man, constantly repeated his good advice.\nHe would try to arouse their conscience by saying: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing,\nmy children? Can you not throw off all these troubles, pay more\nattention to your business, and suppress your anger against your\nneighbors? There is no use in your continuing to live in this way, for\nthe more enraged you become against each other the worse it is for\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAgain was the wise advice of the old man rejected.\n\nAt the beginning of the seventh year of the existence of the feud it\nhappened that a daughter-in-law of Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s was present at a marriage. At\nthe wedding feast she openly accused Gavryl of stealing a horse. Gavryl\nwas intoxicated at the time and was in no mood to stand the insult, so\nin retaliation he struck the woman a terrific blow, which confined her\nto her bed for more than a week. The woman being in delicate health,\nthe worst results were feared.\n\nIvan, glad of a fresh opportunity to harass his neighbor, lodged a\nformal complaint before the district-attorney, hoping to rid himself\nforever of Gavryl by having him sent to Siberia.\n\nOn examining the complaint the district-attorney would not consider it,\nas by that time the injured woman was walking about and as well as\never.\n\nThus again Ivan was disappointed in obtaining his revenge, and, not\nbeing satisfied with the district-attorney\xe2\x80\x99s decision, had the case\ntransferred to the court, where he used all possible means to push his\nsuit. To secure the favor of the _starshina_ (village mayor) he made\nhim a present of half a gallon of sweet vodka; and to the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s\n_pisar_ (secretary) also he gave presents. By this means he succeeded\nin securing a verdict against Gavryl. The sentence was that Gavryl was\nto receive twenty lashes on his bare back, and the punishment was to be\nadministered in the yard which surrounded the court-house.\n\nWhen Ivan heard the sentence read he looked triumphantly at Gavryl to\nsee what effect it would produce on him. Gavryl turned very white on\nhearing that he was to be treated with such indignity, and turning his\nback on the assembly left the room without uttering a word.\n\nIvan followed him out, and as he reached his horse he heard Gavryl\nsaying: \xe2\x80\x9cVery well; my spine will burn from the lashes, but something\nwill burn with greater fierceness in Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s household before long.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan, on hearing these words, instantly returned to the court, and\ngoing up to the judges said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh! just judges, he threatens to burn my\nhouse and all it contains.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA messenger was immediately sent in search of Gavryl, who was soon\nfound and again brought into the presence of the judges.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it true,\xe2\x80\x9d they asked, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you said you would burn Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s house\nand all it contained?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nGavryl replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI did not say anything of the kind. You may give me as\nmany lashes as you please\xe2\x80\x94that is, if you have the power to do so. It\nseems to me that I alone have to suffer for the truth, while he,\xe2\x80\x9d\npointing to Ivan, \xe2\x80\x9cis allowed to do and say what he pleases.\xe2\x80\x9d Gavryl\nwished to say something more, but his lips trembled, and the words\nrefused to come; so in silence he turned his face toward the wall.\n\nThe sight of so much suffering moved even the judges to pity, and,\nbecoming alarmed at Gavryl\xe2\x80\x99s continued silence, they said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe may do\nboth his neighbor and himself some frightful injury.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here, my brothers,\xe2\x80\x9d said one feeble old judge, looking at Ivan and\nGavryl as he spoke, \xe2\x80\x9cI think you had better try to arrange this matter\npeaceably. You, brother Gavryl, did wrong to strike a woman who was in\ndelicate health. It was a lucky thing for you that God had mercy on you\nand that the woman did not die, for if she had I know not what dire\nmisfortune might have overtaken you! It will not do either of you any\ngood to go on living as you are at present. Go, Gavryl, and make\nfriends with Ivan; I am sure he will forgive you, and we will set aside\nthe verdict just given.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe secretary on hearing this said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible to do this on the\npresent case. According to Article 117 this matter has gone too far to\nbe settled peaceably now, as the verdict has been rendered and must be\nenforced.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut the judges would not listen to the secretary, saying to him: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\ntalk altogether too much. You must remember that the first thing is to\nfulfill God\xe2\x80\x99s command to \xe2\x80\x98Love thy neighbor as thyself,\xe2\x80\x99 and all will\nbe well with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThus with kind words the judges tried to reconcile the two peasants.\nTheir words fell on stony ground, however, for Gavryl would not listen\nto them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am fifty years old,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gavryl, \xe2\x80\x9cand have a son married, and never\nfrom my birth has the lash been applied to my back; but now this bear\nIvan has secured a verdict against me which condemns me to receive\ntwenty lashes, and I am forced to bow to this decision and suffer the\nshame of a public beating. Well, he will have cause to remember this.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt this Gavryl\xe2\x80\x99s voice trembled and he stopped speaking, and turning\nhis back on the judges took his departure.\n\nIt was about ten versts\xe2\x80\x99 distance from the court to the homes of the\nneighbors, and this Ivan travelled late. The women had already gone out\nfor the cattle. He unharnessed his horse and put everything in its\nplace, and then went into the _izba_ (room), but found no one there.\n\nThe men had not yet returned from their work in the field and the women\nhad gone to look for the cattle, so that all about the place was quiet.\nGoing into the room, Ivan seated himself on a wooden bench and soon\nbecame lost in thought. He remembered how, when Gavryl first heard the\nsentence which had been passed upon him, he grew very pale, and turned\nhis face to the wall, all the while remaining silent.\n\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s heart ached when he thought of the disgrace which he had been\nthe means of bringing upon Gavryl, and he wondered how he would feel if\nthe same sentence had been passed upon him. His thoughts were\ninterrupted by the coughing of his father, who was lying on the oven.\n\nThe old man, on seeing Ivan, came down off the oven, and slowly\napproaching his son seated himself on the bench beside him, looking at\nhim as though ashamed. He continued to cough as he leaned on the table\nand said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, did they sentence him?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, they sentenced him to receive twenty lashes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ivan.\n\nOn hearing this the old man sorrowfully shook his head, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cThis\nis very bad, Ivan, and what is the meaning of it all? It is indeed very\nbad, but not so bad for Gavryl as for yourself. Well, suppose his\nsentence _is_ carried out, and he gets the twenty lashes, what will it\nbenefit you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will not again strike a woman,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan replied.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it he will not do? He does not do anything worse than what you\nare constantly doing!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis conversation enraged Ivan, and he shouted: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what did he do?\nHe beat a woman nearly to death, and even now he threatens to burn my\nhouse! Must I bow to him for all this?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old man sighed deeply as he said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou, Ivan, are strong and free\nto go wherever you please, while I have been lying for years on the\noven. You think that you know everything and that I do not know\nanything. No! you are still a child, and as such you cannot see that a\nkind of madness controls your actions and blinds your sight. The sins\nof others are ever before you, while you resolutely keep your own\nbehind your back. I know that what Gavryl did was wrong, but if he\nalone should do wrong there would be no evil in the world. Do you think\nthat all the evil in the world is the work of one man alone? No! it\nrequires two persons to work much evil in the world. You see only the\nbad in Gavryl\xe2\x80\x99s character, but you are blind to the evil that is in\nyour own nature. If he alone were bad and you good, then there would be\nno wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old man, after a pause, continued: \xe2\x80\x9cWho tore Gavryl\xe2\x80\x99s beard? Who\ndestroyed his heaps of rye? Who dragged him into court?\xe2\x80\x94and yet you try\nto put all the blame on his shoulders. You are behaving very badly\nyourself, and for that reason you are wrong. I did not act in such a\nmanner, and certainly I never taught you to do so. I lived in peace\nwith Gavryl\xe2\x80\x99s father all the time we were neighbors. We were always the\nbest of friends. If he was without flour his wife would come to me and\nsay, \xe2\x80\x98_Diadia Frol_ [Grandfather], we need flour.\xe2\x80\x99 I would then say:\n\xe2\x80\x98My good woman, go to the warehouse and take as much as you want.\xe2\x80\x99 If\nhe had no one to care for his horses I would say, \xe2\x80\x98Go, _Ivanushka_\n[diminutive of Ivan], and help him to care for them.\xe2\x80\x99 If I required\nanything I would go to him and say, \xe2\x80\x98Grandfather Gordey, I need this or\nthat,\xe2\x80\x99 and he would always reply, \xe2\x80\x98Take just whatever you want.\xe2\x80\x99 By\nthis means we passed an easy and peaceful life. But what is your life\ncompared with it? As the soldiers fought at Plevna, so are you and\nGavryl fighting all the time, only that your battles are far more\ndisgraceful than that fought at Plevna.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old man went on: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you call this living! and what a sin it all\nis! You are a peasant, and the head of the house; therefore, the\nresponsibility of the trouble rests with you. What an example you set\nyour wife and children by constantly quarrelling with your neighbor!\nOnly a short time since your little boy, Taraska, was cursing his aunt\nArina, and his mother only laughed at it, saying, \xe2\x80\x98What a bright child\nhe is!\xe2\x80\x99 Is that right? You are to blame for all this. You should think\nof the salvation of your soul. Is that the way to do it? You say one\nunkind word to me and I will reply with two. You will give me one slap\nin the face, and I will retaliate with two slaps. No, my son; Christ\ndid not teach us foolish people to act in such a way. If any one should\nsay an unkind word to you it is better not to answer at all; but if you\n_do_ reply do it kindly, and his conscience will accuse him, and he\nwill regret his unkindness to you. This is the way Christ taught us to\nlive. He tells us that if a person smite us on the one cheek we should\noffer unto him the other. That is Christ\xe2\x80\x99s command to us, and we should\nfollow it. You should therefore subdue your pride. Am I not right?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan remained silent, but his father\xe2\x80\x99s words had sunk deep into his\nheart.\n\nThe old man coughed and continued: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think Christ thought us\nwicked? Did he not die that we might be saved? Now you think only of\nthis earthly life. Are you better or worse for thinking alone of it?\nAre you better or worse for having begun that Plevna battle? Think of\nyour expense at court and the time lost in going back and forth, and\nwhat have you gained? Your sons have reached manhood, and are able now\nto work for you. You are therefore at liberty to enjoy life and be\nhappy. With the assistance of your children you could reach a high\nstate of prosperity. But now your property instead of increasing is\ngradually growing less, and why? It is the result of your pride. When\nit becomes necessary for you and your boys to go to the field to work,\nyour enemy instead summons you to appear at court or before some kind\nof judicial person. If you do not plow at the proper time and sow at\nthe proper time mother earth will not yield up her products, and you\nand your children will be left destitute. Why did your oats fail this\nyear? When did you sow them? Were you not quarrelling with your\nneighbor instead of attending to your work? You have just now returned\nfrom the town, where you have been the means of having your neighbor\nhumiliated. You have succeeded in getting him sentenced, but in the end\nthe punishment will fall on your own shoulders. Oh! my child, it would\nbe better for you to attend to your work on the farm and train your\nboys to become good farmers and honest men. If any one offend you\nforgive him for Christ\xe2\x80\x99s sake, and then prosperity will smile on your\nwork and a light and happy feeling will fill your heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan still remained silent.\n\nThe old father in a pleading voice continued: \xe2\x80\x9cTake an old man\xe2\x80\x99s\nadvice. Go and harness your horse, drive back to the court, and\nwithdraw all these complaints against your neighbor. To-morrow go to\nhim, offer to make peace in Christ\xe2\x80\x99s name, and invite him to your\nhouse. It will be a holy day (the birth of the Virgin Mary). Get out\nthe samovar and have some vodka, and over both forgive and forget each\nother\xe2\x80\x99s sins, promising not to transgress in the future, and advise\nyour women and children to do the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan heaved a deep sigh but felt easier in his heart, as he thought:\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old man speaks the truth;\xe2\x80\x9d yet he was in doubt as to how he would\nput his father\xe2\x80\x99s advice into practice.\n\nThe old man, surmising his uncertainty, said to Ivan: \xe2\x80\x9cGo, Ivanushka;\ndo not delay. Extinguish the fire in the beginning, before it grows\nlarge, for then it may be impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s father wished to say more to him, but was prevented by the\narrival of the women, who came into the room chattering like so many\nmagpies. They had already heard of Gavryl\xe2\x80\x99s sentence, and of how he\nthreatened to set fire to Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s house. They found out all about it,\nand in telling it to their neighbors added their own versions of the\nstory, with the usual exaggeration. Meeting in the pasture-ground, they\nproceeded to quarrel with Gavryl\xe2\x80\x99s women. They related how the latter\xe2\x80\x99s\ndaughter-in-law had threatened to secure the influence of the manager\nof a certain noble\xe2\x80\x99s estate in behalf of his friend Gavryl; also that\nthe school-teacher was writing a petition to the Czar himself against\nIvan, explaining in detail his theft of the perchbolt and partial\ndestruction of Gavryl\xe2\x80\x99s garden\xe2\x80\x94declaring that half of Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s land was\nto be given to them.\n\nIvan listened calmly to their stories, but his anger was soon aroused\nonce more, when he abandoned his intention of making peace with Gavryl.\n\nAs Ivan was always busy about the household, he did not stop to speak\nto the wrangling women, but immediately left the room, directing his\nsteps toward the barn. Before getting through with his work the sun had\nset and the boys had returned from their plowing. Ivan met them and\nasked about their work, helping them to put things in order and leaving\nthe broken horse-collar aside to be repaired. He intended to perform\nsome other duties, but it became too dark and he was obliged to leave\nthem till the next day. He fed the cattle, however, and opened the gate\nthat Taraska might take his horses to pasture for the night, after\nwhich he closed it again and went into the house for his supper.\n\nBy this time he had forgotten all about Gavryl and what his father had\nsaid to him. Yet, just as he touched the door-knob, he heard sounds of\nquarrelling proceeding from his neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s house.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I want with that devil?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Gavryl to some one. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\ndeserves to be killed!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan stopped and listened for a moment, when he shook his head\nthreateningly and entered the room. When he came in, the apartment was\nalready lighted. His daughter-in-law was working with her loom, while\nthe old woman was preparing the supper. The eldest son was twining\nstrings for his _lapti_ (peasant\xe2\x80\x99s shoes made of strips of bark from\nthe linden-tree). The other son was sitting by the table reading a\nbook. The room presented a pleasant appearance, everything being in\norder and the inmates apparently gay and happy\xe2\x80\x94the only dark shadow\nbeing that cast over the household by Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s trouble with his neighbor.\n\nIvan came in very cross, and, angrily throwing aside a cat which lay\nsleeping on the bench, cursed the women for having misplaced a pail. He\nlooked very sad and serious, and, seating himself in a corner of the\nroom, proceeded to repair the horse-collar. He could not forget Gavryl,\nhowever\xe2\x80\x94the threatening words he had used in the court-room and those\nwhich Ivan had just heard.\n\nPresently Taraska came in, and after having his supper, put on his\nsheepskin coat, and, taking some bread with him, returned to watch over\nhis horses for the night. His eldest brother wished to accompany him,\nbut Ivan himself arose and went with him as far as the porch. The night\nwas dark and cloudy and a strong wind was blowing, which produced a\npeculiar whistling sound that was most unpleasant to the ear. Ivan\nhelped his son to mount his horse, which, followed by a colt, started\noff on a gallop.\n\nIvan stood for a few moments looking around him and listening to the\nclatter of the horse\xe2\x80\x99s hoofs as Taraska rode down the village street.\nHe heard him meet other boys on horseback, who rode quite as well as\nTaraska, and soon all were lost in the darkness.\n\nIvan remained standing by the gate in a gloomy mood, as he was unable\nto banish from his mind the harassing thoughts of Gavryl, which the\nlatter\xe2\x80\x99s menacing words had inspired: \xe2\x80\x9cSomething will burn with greater\nfierceness in Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s household before long.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is so desperate,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Ivan, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he may set fire to my house\nregardless of the danger to his own. At present everything is dry, and\nas the wind is so high he may sneak from the back of his own building,\nstart a fire, and get away unseen by any of us.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe may burn and steal without being found out, and thus go unpunished.\nI wish I could catch him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis thought so worried Ivan that he decided not to return to his\nhouse, but went out and stood on the street-corner.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Ivan to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI will take a walk around the\npremises and examine everything carefully, for who knows what he may be\ntempted to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan moved very cautiously round to the back of his buildings, not\nmaking the slightest noise, and scarcely daring to breathe. Just as he\nreached a corner of the house he looked toward the fence, and it seemed\nto him that he saw something moving, and that it was slowly creeping\ntoward the corner of the house opposite to where he was standing. He\nstepped back quickly and hid himself in the shadow of the building.\nIvan stood and listened, but all was quiet. Not a sound could be heard\nbut the moaning of the wind through the branches of the trees, and the\nrustling of the leaves as it caught them up and whirled them in all\ndirections. So dense was the darkness that it was at first impossible\nfor Ivan to see more than a few feet beyond where he stood.\n\nAfter a time, however, his sight becoming accustomed to the gloom, he\nwas enabled to see for a considerable distance. The plow and his other\nfarming implements stood just where he had placed them. He could see\nalso the opposite corner of the house.\n\nHe looked in every direction, but no one was in sight, and he thought\nto himself that his imagination must have played him some trick,\nleading him to believe that some one was moving when there really was\nno one there.\n\nStill, Ivan was not satisfied, and decided to make a further\nexamination of the premises. As on the previous occasion, he moved so\nvery cautiously that he could not hear even the sound of his own\nfootsteps. He had taken the precaution to remove his shoes, that he\nmight step the more noiselessly. When he reached the corner of the barn\nit again seemed to him that he saw something moving, this time near the\nplow; but it quickly disappeared. By this time Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s heart was beating\nvery fast, and he was standing in a listening attitude when a sudden\nflash of light illumined the spot, and he could distinctly see the\nfigure of a man seated on his haunches with his back turned toward him,\nand in the act of lighting a bunch of straw which he held in his hand!\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s heart began to beat yet faster, and he became terribly excited,\nwalking up and down with rapid strides, but without making a noise.\n\nIvan said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, he cannot get away, for he will be caught in the\nvery act.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan had taken a few more steps when suddenly a bright light flamed up,\nbut not in the same spot in which he had seen the figure of the man\nsitting. Gavryl had lighted the straw, and running to the barn held it\nunder the edge of the roof, which began to burn fiercely; and by the\nlight of the fire he could distinctly see his neighbor standing.\n\nAs an eagle springs at a skylark, so sprang Ivan at Gavryl, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cI\nwill tear you into pieces! You shall not get away from me this time!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut \xe2\x80\x9cGavryl the Lame,\xe2\x80\x9d hearing footsteps, wrenched himself free from\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s grasp and ran like a hare past the buildings.\n\nIvan, now terribly excited, shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall not escape me!\xe2\x80\x9d and\nstarted in pursuit; but just as he reached him and was about to grasp\nthe collar of his coat, Gavryl succeeded in jumping to one side, and\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s coat became entangled in something and he was thrown violently\nto the ground. Jumping quickly to his feet he shouted, \xe2\x80\x9c_Karaool!\nderji!_\xe2\x80\x9d (watch! catch!)\n\nWhile Ivan was regaining his feet Gavryl succeeded in reaching his\nhouse, but Ivan followed so quickly that he caught up with him before\nhe could enter. Just as he was about to grasp him he was struck on the\nhead with some hard substance. He had been hit on the temple as with a\nstone. The blow was struck by Gavryl, who had picked up an oaken stave,\nand with it gave Ivan a terrible blow on the head.\n\nIvan was stunned, and bright sparks danced before his eyes, while he\nswayed from side to side like a drunken man, until finally all became\ndark and he sank to the ground unconscious.\n\nWhen he recovered his senses, Gavryl was nowhere to be seen, but all\naround him was as light as day. Strange sounds proceeded from the\ndirection of his house, and turning his face that way he saw that his\nbarns were on fire. The rear parts of both were already destroyed, and\nthe flames were leaping toward the front. Fire, smoke, and bits of\nburning straw were being rapidly whirled by the high wind over to where\nhis house stood, and he expected every moment to see it burst into\nflames.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this, brother?\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan cried out, as he beat his thighs with his\nhands. \xe2\x80\x9cI should have stopped to snatch the bunch of burning straw,\nand, throwing it on the ground, should have extinguished it with my\nfeet!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan tried to cry out and arouse his people, but his lips refused to\nutter a word. He next tried to run, but he could not move his feet, and\nhis legs seemed to twist themselves around each other. After several\nattempts he succeeded in taking one or two steps, when he again began\nto stagger and gasp for breath. It was some moments before he made\nanother attempt to move, but after considerable exertion he finally\nreached the barn, the rear of which was by this time entirely consumed;\nand the corner of his house had already caught fire. Dense volumes of\nsmoke began to pour out of the room, which made it difficult to\napproach.\n\nA crowd of peasants had by this time gathered, but they found it\nimpossible to save their homes, so they carried everything which they\ncould to a place of safety. The cattle they drove into neighboring\npastures and left some one to care for them.\n\nThe wind carried the sparks from Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s house to Gavryl\xe2\x80\x99s, and it, too,\ntook fire and was consumed. The wind continued to increase with great\nfury, and the flames spread to both sides of the street, until in a\nvery short time more than half the village was burned.\n\nThe members of Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s household had great difficulty in getting out of\nthe burning building, but the neighbors rescued the old man and carried\nhim to a place of safety, while the women escaped in only their\nnight-clothes. Everything was burned, including the cattle and all the\nfarm implements. The women lost their trunks, which were filled with\nquantities of clothing, the accumulation of years. The storehouse and\nall the provisions perished in the flames, not even the chickens being\nsaved.\n\nGavryl, however, more fortunate than Ivan, saved his cattle and a few\nother things.\n\nThe village was burning all night.\n\nIvan stood near his home, gazing sadly at the burning building, and he\nkept constantly repeating to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cI should have taken away the\nbunch of burning straw, and have stamped out the fire with my feet.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut when he saw his home fall in a smouldering heap, in spite of the\nterrible heat he sprang into the midst of it and carried out a charred\nlog. The women seeing him, and fearing that he would lose his life,\ncalled to him to come back, but he would not pay any attention to them\nand went a second time to get a log. Still weak from the terrible blow\nwhich Gavryl had given him, he was overcome by the heat, and fell into\nthe midst of the burning mass. Fortunately, his eldest son saw him\nfall, and rushing into the fire succeeded in getting hold of him and\ncarrying him out of it. Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s hair, beard, and clothing were burned\nentirely off. His hands were also frightfully injured, but he seemed\nindifferent to pain.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrief drove him crazy,\xe2\x80\x9d the people said.\n\nThe fire was growing less, but Ivan still stood where he could see it,\nand kept repeating to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI should have taken,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.\n\nThe morning after the fire the _starosta_ (village elder) sent his son\nto Ivan to tell him that the old man, his father, was dying, and wanted\nto see him to bid him good-bye.\n\nIn his grief Ivan had forgotten all about his father, and could not\nunderstand what was being said to him. In a dazed way he asked: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\nfather? Whom does he want?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe elder\xe2\x80\x99s son again repeated his father\xe2\x80\x99s message to Ivan. \xe2\x80\x9cYour aged\nparent is at our house dying, and he wants to see you and bid you\ngood-bye. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you go now, uncle Ivan?\xe2\x80\x9d the boy said.\n\nFinally Ivan understood, and followed the elder\xe2\x80\x99s son.\n\nWhen Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s father was carried from the oven, he was slightly injured\nby a big bunch of burning straw falling on him just as he reached the\nstreet. To insure his safety he was removed to the elder\xe2\x80\x99s house, which\nstood a considerable distance from his late home, and where it was not\nlikely that the fire would reach it.\n\nWhen Ivan arrived at the elder\xe2\x80\x99s home he found only the latter\xe2\x80\x99s wife\nand children, who were all seated on the brick oven. The old man was\nlying on a bench holding a lighted candle in his hand (a Russian custom\nwhen a person is dying). Hearing a noise, he turned his face toward the\ndoor, and when he saw it was his son he tried to move. He motioned for\nIvan to come nearer, and when he did so he whispered in a trembling\nvoice: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Ivanushka, did I not tell you before what would be the\nresult of this sad affair? Who set the village on fire?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe, he, _batiushka_ [little father]; he did it. I caught him. He\nplaced the bunch of burning straw to the barn in my presence. Instead\nof running after him, I should have snatched the bunch of burning straw\nand throwing it on the ground have stamped it out with my feet; and\nthen there would have been no fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIvan,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, \xe2\x80\x9cdeath is fast approaching me, and remember\nthat you also will have to die. Who did this dreadful thing? Whose is\nthe sin?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan gazed at the noble face of his dying father and was silent. His\nheart was too full for utterance.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the presence of God,\xe2\x80\x9d the old man continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwhose is the sin?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was only now that the truth began to dawn upon Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s mind, and that\nhe realized how foolish he had acted. He sobbed bitterly, and fell on\nhis knees before his father, and, crying like a child, said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear father, forgive me, for Christ\xe2\x80\x99s sake, for I am guilty before\nGod and before you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old man transferred the lighted candle from his right hand to the\nleft, and, raising the former to his forehead, tried to make the sign\nof the cross, but owing to weakness was unable to do so.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlory to Thee, O Lord! Glory to Thee!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed; and turning his\ndim eyes toward his son, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cSee here, Ivanushka! Ivanushka, my\ndear son!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, my dear father?\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old man, \xe2\x80\x9cnow that you have no\nhome?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan cried and said: \xe2\x80\x9cI do not know how we shall live now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old man closed his eyes and made a movement with his lips, as if\ngathering his feeble strength for a final effort. Slowly opening his\neyes, he whispered:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould you live according to God\xe2\x80\x99s commands you will be happy and\nprosperous again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old man was now silent for awhile and then, smiling sadly, he\ncontinued:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here, Ivanushka, keep silent concerning this trouble, and do not\ntell who set the village on fire. Forgive one sin of your neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s,\nand God will forgive two of yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nGrasping the candle with both hands, Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s father heaved a deep sigh,\nand, stretching himself out on his back, yielded up the ghost.\n\n\nIvan for once accepted his father\xe2\x80\x99s advice. He did not betray Gavryl,\nand no one ever learned the origin of the fire.\n\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s heart became more kindly disposed toward his old enemy, feeling\nthat much of the fault in connection with this sad affair rested with\nhimself.\n\nGavryl was greatly surprised that Ivan did not denounce him before all\nthe villagers, and at first he stood in much fear of him, but he soon\nafterward overcame this feeling.\n\nThe two peasants ceased to quarrel, and their families followed their\nexample. While they were building new houses, both families lived\nbeneath the same roof, and when they moved into their respective homes,\nIvan and Gavryl lived on as good terms as their fathers had done before\nthem.\n\nIvan remembered his dying father\xe2\x80\x99s command, and took deeply to heart\nthe evident warning of God that _a fire should be extinguished in the\nbeginning_. If any one wronged him he did not seek revenge, but instead\nmade every effort to settle the matter peaceably. If any one spoke to\nhim unkindly, he did not answer in the same way, but replied softly,\nand tried to persuade the person not to speak evil. He taught the women\nand children of his household to do the same.\n\nIvan Scherbakoff was now a reformed man.\n\nHe lived well and peacefully, and again became prosperous.\n\nLet us, therefore, have peace, live in brotherly love and kindness, and\nwe will be happy.\n\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPOLIKUSHKA;\xe2\x80\x9d\nor, _The Lot of a Wicked Court Servant_.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\nPolikey was a court man\xe2\x80\x94one of the staff of servants belonging to the\ncourt household of a _boyarinia_ (lady of the nobility).\n\nHe held a very insignificant position on the estate, and lived in a\nrather poor, small house with his wife and children.\n\nThe house was built by the deceased nobleman whose widow he still\ncontinued to serve, and may be described as follows: The four walls\nsurrounding the one _izba_ (room) were built of stone, and the interior\nwas ten yards square. A Russian stove stood in the centre, around which\nwas a free passage. Each corner was fenced off as a separate inclosure\nto the extent of several feet, and the one nearest to the door (the\nsmallest of all) was known as \xe2\x80\x9cPolikey\xe2\x80\x99s corner.\xe2\x80\x9d Elsewhere in the room\nstood the bed (with quilt, sheet, and cotton pillows), the cradle (with\na baby lying therein), and the three-legged table, on which the meals\nwere prepared and the family washing was done. At the latter also\nPolikey was at work on the preparation of some materials for use in his\nprofession\xe2\x80\x94that of an amateur veterinary surgeon. A calf, some hens,\nthe family clothes and household utensils, together with seven persons,\nfilled the little home to the utmost of its capacity. It would indeed\nhave been almost impossible for them to move around had it not been for\nthe convenience of the stove, on which some of them slept at night, and\nwhich served as a table in the day-time.\n\nIt seemed hard to realize how so many persons managed to live in such\nclose quarters.\n\nPolikey\xe2\x80\x99s wife, Akulina, did the washing, spun and wove, bleached her\nlinen, cooked and baked, and found time also to quarrel and gossip with\nher neighbors.\n\nThe monthly allowance of food which they received from the noblewoman\xe2\x80\x99s\nhouse was amply sufficient for the whole family, and there was always\nenough meal left to make mash for the cow. Their fuel they got free,\nand likewise the food for the cattle. In addition they were given a\nsmall piece of land on which to raise vegetables. They had a cow, a\ncalf, and a number of chickens to care for.\n\nPolikey was employed in the stables to take care of two stallions, and,\nwhen necessary, to bleed the horses and cattle and clean their hoofs.\n\nIn his treatment of the animals he used syringes, plasters, and various\nother remedies and appliances of his own invention. For these services\nhe received whatever provisions were required by his family, and a\ncertain sum of money\xe2\x80\x94all of which would have been sufficient to enable\nthem to live comfortably and even happily, if their hearts had not been\nfilled with the shadow of a great sorrow.\n\nThis shadow darkened the lives of the entire family.\n\nPolikey, while young, was employed in a horse-breeding establishment in\na neighboring village. The head stableman was a notorious horse-thief,\nknown far and wide as a great rogue, who, for his many misdeeds, was\nfinally exiled to Siberia. Under his instruction Polikey underwent a\ncourse of training, and, being but a boy, was easily induced to perform\nmany evil deeds. He became so expert in the various kinds of wickedness\npracticed by his teacher that, though he many times would gladly have\nabandoned his evil ways, he could not, owing to the great hold these\nearly-formed habits had upon him. His father and mother died when he\nwas but a child, and he had no one to point out to him the paths of\nvirtue.\n\nIn addition to his other numerous shortcomings, Polikey was fond of\nstrong drink. He also had a habit of appropriating other people\xe2\x80\x99s\nproperty, when the opportunity offered of his doing so without being\nseen. Collar-straps, padlocks, perch-bolts, and things even of greater\nvalue belonging to others found their way with remarkable rapidity and\nin great quantities to Polikey\xe2\x80\x99s home. He did not, however, keep such\nthings for his own use, but sold them whenever he could find a\npurchaser. His payment consisted chiefly of whiskey, though sometimes\nhe received cash.\n\nThis sort of employment, as his neighbors said, was both light and\nprofitable; it required neither education nor labor. It had one\ndrawback, however, which was calculated to reconcile his victims to\ntheir losses: Though he could for a time have all his needs supplied\nwithout expending either labor or money, there was always the\npossibility of his methods being discovered; and this result was sure\nto be followed by a long term of imprisonment. This impending danger\nmade life a burden for Polikey and his family.\n\nSuch a setback indeed very nearly happened to Polikey early in his\ncareer. He married while still young, and God gave him much happiness.\nHis wife, who was a shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, was a strong, intelligent,\nhard-working woman. She bore him many children, each of whom was said\nto be better than the preceding one.\n\nPolikey still continued to steal, but once was caught with some small\narticles belonging to others in his possession. Among them was a pair\nof leather reins, the property of another peasant, who beat him\nseverely and reported him to his mistress.\n\nFrom that time on Polikey was an object of suspicion, and he was twice\nagain detected in similar escapades. By this time the people began to\nabuse him, and the clerk of the court threatened to recruit him into\nthe army as a soldier (which is regarded by the peasants as a great\npunishment and disgrace). His noble mistress severely reprimanded him;\nhis wife wept from grief for his downfall, and everything went from bad\nto worse.\n\nPolikey, notwithstanding his weakness, was a good-natured sort of man,\nbut his love of strong drink had so overcome every moral instinct that\nat times he was scarcely responsible for his actions. This habit he\nvainly endeavored to overcome. It often happened that when he returned\nhome intoxicated, his wife, losing all patience, roundly cursed him and\ncruelly beat him. At times he would cry like a child, and bemoan his\nfate, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunate man that I am, what shall I do? _Let my eyes\nburst into pieces_ if I do not forever give up the vile habit! I will\nnot again touch vodka.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn spite of all his promises of reform, but a short period (perhaps a\nmonth) would elapse when Polikey would again mysteriously disappear\nfrom his home and be lost for several days on a spree.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom what source does he get the money he spends so freely?\xe2\x80\x9d the\nneighbors inquired of each other, as they sadly shook their heads.\n\nOne of his most unfortunate exploits in the matter of stealing was in\nconnection with a clock which belonged to the estate of his mistress.\nThe clock stood in the private office of the noblewoman, and was so old\nas to have outlived its usefulness, and was simply kept as an heirloom.\nIt so happened that Polikey went into the office one day when no one\nwas present but himself, and, seeing the old clock, it seemed to\npossess a peculiar fascination for him, and he speedily transferred it\nto his person. He carried it to a town not far from the village, where\nhe very readily found a purchaser.\n\nAs if purposely to secure his punishment, it happened that the\nstorekeeper to whom he sold it proved to be a relative of one of the\ncourt servants, and who, when he visited his friend on the next\nholiday, related all about his purchase of the clock.\n\nAn investigation was immediately instituted, and all the details of\nPolikey\xe2\x80\x99s transaction were brought to light and reported to his noble\nmistress. He was called into her presence, and, when confronted with\nthe story of the theft, broke down and confessed all. He fell on his\nknees before the noblewoman and plead with her for mercy. The\nkind-hearted lady lectured him about God, the salvation of his soul,\nand his future life. She talked to him also about the misery and\ndisgrace he brought upon his family, and altogether so worked upon his\nfeelings that he cried like a child. In conclusion his kind mistress\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cI will forgive you this time on the condition that you promise\nfaithfully to reform, and never again to take what does not belong to\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPolikey, still weeping, replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI will never steal again in all my\nlife, and if I break my promise may the earth open and swallow me up,\nand let my body be burned with red-hot irons!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPolikey returned to his home, and throwing himself on the oven spent\nthe entire day weeping and repeating the promise made to his mistress.\n\nFrom that time on he was not again caught stealing, but his life became\nextremely sad, for he was regarded with suspicion by every one and\npointed to as a thief.\n\nWhen the time came round for securing recruits for the army, all the\npeasants singled out Polikey as the first to be taken. The\nsuperintendent was especially anxious to get rid of him, and went to\nhis mistress to induce her to have him sent away. The kind-hearted and\nmerciful woman, remembering the peasant\xe2\x80\x99s repentance, refused to grant\nthe superintendent\xe2\x80\x99s request, and told him he must take some other man\nin his stead.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nOne evening Polikey was sitting on his bed beside the table, preparing\nsome medicine for the cattle, when suddenly the door was thrown wide\nopen, and Aksiutka, a young girl from the court, rushed in. Almost out\nof breath, she said: \xe2\x80\x9cMy mistress has ordered you, Polikey _Illitch_\n[son of Ilia], to come up to the court at once!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe girl was standing and still breathing heavily from her late\nexertion as she continued: \xe2\x80\x9cEgor Mikhailovitch, the superintendent, has\nbeen to see our lady about having you drafted into the army, and,\nPolikey Illitch, your name was mentioned among others. Our lady has\nsent me to tell you to come up to the court immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs soon as Aksiutka had delivered her message she left the room in the\nsame abrupt manner in which she had entered.\n\nAkulina, without saying a word, got up and brought her husband\xe2\x80\x99s boots\nto him. They were poor, worn-out things which some soldier had given\nhim, and his wife did not glance at him as she handed them to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to change your shirt, Illitch?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, at last.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Polikey.\n\nAkulina did not once look at him all the time he was putting on his\nboots and preparing to go to the court. Perhaps, after all, it was\nbetter that she did not do so. His face was very pale and his lips\ntrembled. He slowly combed his hair and was about to depart without\nsaying a word, when his wife stopped him to arrange the ribbon on his\nshirt, and, after toying a little with his coat, she put his hat on for\nhim and he left the little home.\n\nPolikey\xe2\x80\x99s next-door neighbors were a joiner and his wife. A thin\npartition only separated the two families, and each could hear what the\nother said and did. Soon after Polikey\xe2\x80\x99s departure a woman was heard to\nsay: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Polikey Illitch, so your mistress has sent for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe voice was that of the joiner\xe2\x80\x99s wife on the other side of the\npartition. Akulina and the woman had quarrelled that morning about some\ntrifling thing done by one of Polikey\xe2\x80\x99s children, and it afforded her\nthe greatest pleasure to learn that her neighbor had been summoned into\nthe presence of his noble mistress. She looked upon such a circumstance\nas a bad omen. She continued talking to herself and said: \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps she\nwants to send him to the town to make some purchases for her household.\nI did not suppose she would select such a faithful man as you are to\nperform such a service for her. If it should prove that she _does_ want\nto send you to the next town, just buy me a quarter-pound of tea. Will\nyou, Polikey Illitch?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPoor Akulina, on hearing the joiner\xe2\x80\x99s wife talking so unkindly of her\nhusband, could hardly suppress the tears, and, the tirade continuing,\nshe at last became angry, and wished she could in some way punish her.\n\nForgetting her neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s unkindness, her thoughts soon turned in\nanother direction, and glancing at her sleeping children she said to\nherself that they might soon be orphans and she herself a soldier\xe2\x80\x99s\nwidow. This thought greatly distressed her, and burying her face in her\nhands she seated herself on the bed, where several of her progeny were\nfast asleep. Presently a little voice interrupted her meditations by\ncrying out, \xe2\x80\x9c_Mamushka_ [little mother], you are crushing me,\xe2\x80\x9d and the\nchild pulled her nightdress from under her mother\xe2\x80\x99s arms.\n\nAkulina, with her head still resting on her hands, said: \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it\nwould be better if we all should die. I only seem to have brought you\ninto the world to suffer sorrow and misery.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nUnable longer to control her grief, she burst into violent weeping,\nwhich served to increase the amusement of the joiner\xe2\x80\x99s wife, who had\nnot forgotten the morning\xe2\x80\x99s squabble, and she laughed loudly at her\nneighbor\xe2\x80\x99s woe.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nAbout half an hour had passed when the youngest child began to cry and\nAkulina arose to feed it. She had by this time ceased to weep, and\nafter feeding the infant she again fell into her old position, with her\nface buried in her hands. She was very pale, but this only increased\nher beauty. After a time she raised her head, and staring at the\nburning candle she began to question herself as to why she had married,\nand as to the reason that the Czar required so many soldiers.\n\nPresently she heard steps outside, and knew that her husband was\nreturning. She hurriedly wiped away the last traces of her tears as she\narose to let him pass into the centre of the room.\n\nPolikey made his appearance with a look of triumph on his face, threw\nhis hat on the bed, and hastily removed his coat; but not a word did he\nutter.\n\nAkulina, unable to restrain her impatience, asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what did she\nwant with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPshaw!\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cit is very well known that Polikushka is\nconsidered the worst man in the village; but when it comes to business\nof importance, who is selected then? Why, Polikushka, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat kind of business?\xe2\x80\x9d Akulina timidly inquired.\n\nBut Polikey was in no hurry to answer her question. He lighted his pipe\nwith a very imposing air, and spit several times on the floor before he\nreplied.\n\nStill retaining his pompous manner, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cShe has ordered me to go\nto a certain merchant in the town and collect a considerable sum of\nmoney.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou to collect money?\xe2\x80\x9d questioned Akulina.\n\nPolikey only shook his head and smiled significantly, saying:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You,\xe2\x80\x99 the mistress said to me, \xe2\x80\x98are a man resting under a grave\nsuspicion\xe2\x80\x94a man who is considered unsafe to trust in any capacity; but\nI have faith in you, and will intrust you with this important business\nof mine in preference to any one else.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPolikey related all this in a loud voice, so that his neighbor might\nhear what he had to say.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You promised me to reform,\xe2\x80\x99 my noble mistress said to me, \xe2\x80\x98and I will\nbe the first to show you how much faith I have in your promise. I want\nyou to ride into town, and, going to the principal merchant there,\ncollect a sum of money from him and bring it to me.\xe2\x80\x99 I said to my\nmistress: \xe2\x80\x98Everything you order shall be done. I will only too gladly\nobey your slightest wish.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen my mistress said: \xe2\x80\x98Do you understand, Polikey, that your future\nlot depends upon the faithful performance of this duty I impose upon\nyou?\xe2\x80\x99 I replied: \xe2\x80\x98Yes, I understand everything, and feel that I will\nsucceed in performing acceptably any task which you may impose upon me.\nI have been accused of every kind of evil deed that it is possible to\ncharge a man with, but I have never done anything seriously wrong\nagainst you, your honor.\xe2\x80\x99 In this way I talked to our mistress until I\nsucceeded in convincing her that my repentance was sincere, and she\nbecame greatly softened toward me, saying, \xe2\x80\x98If you are successful I\nwill give you the first place at the court.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how much money are you to collect?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Akulina.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFifteen hundred rubles,\xe2\x80\x9d carelessly answered Polikey.\n\nAkulina sadly shook her head as she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen are you to start?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe ordered me to leave here to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d Polikey replied. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Take any\nhorse you please,\xe2\x80\x99 she said. \xe2\x80\x98Come to the office, and I will see you\nthere and wish you God-speed on your journey.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlory to Thee, O Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d said Akulina, as she arose and made the sign\nof the cross. \xe2\x80\x9cGod, I am sure, will bless you, Illitch,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, in\na whisper, so that the people on the other side of the partition could\nnot hear what she said, all the while holding on to his sleeve.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIllitch,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried at last, excitedly, \xe2\x80\x9cfor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake promise me\nthat you will not touch a drop of vodka. Take an oath before God, and\nkiss the cross, so that I may be sure that you will not break your\npromise!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPolikey replied in most contemptuous tones: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I will dare\nto touch vodka when I shall have such a large sum of money in my care?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAkulina, have a clean shirt ready for the morning,\xe2\x80\x9d were his parting\nwords for the night.\n\nSo Polikey and his wife went to sleep in a happy frame of mind and full\nof bright dreams for the future.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\nVery early the next morning, almost before the stars had hidden\nthemselves from view, there was seen standing before Polikey\xe2\x80\x99s home a\nlow wagon, the same in which the superintendent himself used to ride;\nand harnessed to it was a large-boned, dark-brown mare, called for some\nunknown reason by the name of _Baraban_ (drum). Aniutka, Polikey\xe2\x80\x99s\neldest daughter, in spite of the heavy rain and the cold wind which was\nblowing, stood outside barefooted and held (not without some fear) the\nreins in one hand, while with the other she endeavored to keep her\ngreen and yellow overcoat wound around her body, and also to hold\nPolikey\xe2\x80\x99s sheepskin coat.\n\nIn the house there were the greatest noise and confusion. The morning\nwas still so dark that the little daylight there was failed to\npenetrate through the broken panes of glass, the window being stuffed\nin many places with rags and paper to exclude the cold air.\n\nAkulina ceased from her cooking for a while and helped to get Polikey\nready for the journey. Most of the children were still in bed, very\nlikely as a protection against the cold, for Akulina had taken away the\nbig overcoat which usually covered them and had substituted a shawl of\nher own. Polikey\xe2\x80\x99s shirt was all ready, nice and clean, but his shoes\nbadly needed repairing, and this fact caused his devoted wife much\nanxiety. She took from her own feet the thick woollen stockings she was\nwearing, and gave them to Polikey. She then began to repair his shoes,\npatching up the holes so as to protect his feet from dampness.\n\nWhile this was going on he was sitting on the side of the bed with his\nfeet dangling over the edge, and trying to turn the sash which confined\nhis coat at the waist. He was anxious to look as clean as possible, and\nhe declared his sash looked like a dirty rope.\n\nOne of his daughters, enveloped in a sheepskin coat, was sent to a\nneighbor\xe2\x80\x99s house to borrow a hat.\n\nWithin Polikey\xe2\x80\x99s home the greatest confusion reigned, for the court\nservants were constantly arriving with innumerable small orders which\nthey wished Polikey to execute for them in town. One wanted needles,\nanother tea, another tobacco, and last came the joiner\xe2\x80\x99s wife, who by\nthis time had prepared her samovar, and, anxious to make up the quarrel\nof the previous day, brought the traveller a cup of tea.\n\nNeighbor Nikita refused the loan of the hat, so the old one had to be\npatched up for the occasion. This occupied some time, as there were\nmany holes in it.\n\nFinally Polikey was all ready, and jumping on the wagon started on his\njourney, after first making the sign of the cross.\n\nAt the last moment his little boy, Mishka, ran to the door, begging to\nbe given a short ride; and then his little daughter, Mashka, appeared\non the scene and pleaded that she, too, might have a ride, declaring\nthat she would be quite warm enough without furs.\n\nPolikey stopped the horse on hearing the children, and Akulina placed\nthem in the wagon, together with two others belonging to a neighbor\xe2\x80\x94all\nanxious to have a short ride.\n\nAs Akulina helped the little ones into the wagon she took occasion to\nremind Polikey of the solemn promise he had made her not to touch a\ndrop of vodka during the journey.\n\nPolikey drove the children as far as the blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s place, where he\nlet them out of the wagon, telling them they must return home. He then\narranged his clothing, and, setting his hat firmly on his head, started\nhis horse on a trot.\n\nThe two children, Mishka and Mashka, both barefooted, started running\nat such a rapid pace that a strange dog from another village, seeing\nthem flying over the road, dropped his tail between his legs and ran\nhome squealing.\n\nThe weather was very cold, a sharp cutting wind blowing continuously;\nbut this did not disturb Polikey, whose mind was engrossed with\npleasant thoughts. As he rode through the wintry blasts he kept\nrepeating to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cSo I am the man they wanted to send to Siberia,\nand whom they threatened to enroll as a soldier\xe2\x80\x94the same man whom every\none abused, and said he was lazy, and who was pointed out as a thief\nand given the meanest work on the estate to do! Now I am going to\nreceive a large sum of money, for which my mistress is sending me\nbecause she trusts me. I am also riding in the same wagon that the\nsuperintendent himself uses when he is riding as a representative of\nthe court. I have the same harness, leather horse-collar, reins, and\nall the other gear.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPolikey, filled with pride at thought of the mission with which he had\nbeen intrusted, drew himself up with an air of pride, and, fixing his\nold hat more firmly on his head, buttoned his coat tightly about him\nand urged his horse to greater speed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust to think,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued; \xe2\x80\x9cI shall have in my possession three\nthousand half-rubles [the peasant manner of speaking of money so as to\nmake it appear a larger sum than it really is], and will carry them in\nmy bosom. If I wished to I might run away to Odessa instead of taking\nthe money to my mistress. But no; I will not do that. I will surely\ncarry the money straight to the one who has been kind enough to trust\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen Polikey reached the first _kabak_ (tavern) he found that from long\nhabit the mare was naturally turning her head toward it; but he would\nnot allow her to stop, though money had been given him to purchase both\nfood and drink. Striking the animal a sharp blow with the whip, he\npassed by the tavern. The performance was repeated when he reached the\nnext kabak, which looked very inviting; but he resolutely set his face\nagainst entering, and passed on.\n\nAbout noon he arrived at his destination, and getting down from the\nwagon approached the gate of the merchant\xe2\x80\x99s house where the servants of\nthe court always stopped. Opening it he led the mare through, and\n(after unharnessing her) fed her. This done, he next entered the house\nand had dinner with the merchant\xe2\x80\x99s workingman, and to them he related\nwhat an important mission he had been sent on, making himself very\namusing by the pompous air which he assumed. Dinner over, he carried a\nletter to the merchant which the noblewoman had given him to deliver.\n\nThe merchant, knowing thoroughly the reputation which Polikey bore,\nfelt doubtful of trusting him with so much money, and somewhat\nanxiously inquired if he really had received orders to carry so many\nrubles.\n\nPolikey tried to appear offended at this question, but did not succeed,\nand he only smiled.\n\nThe merchant, after reading the letter a second time and being\nconvinced that all was right, gave Polikey the money, which he put in\nhis bosom for safe-keeping.\n\nOn his way to the house he did not once stop at any of the shops he\npassed. The clothing establishments possessed no attractions for him,\nand after he had safely passed them all he stood for a moment, feeling\nvery pleased that he had been able to withstand temptation, and then\nwent on his way.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have money enough to buy up everything,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I will not do\nso.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe numerous commissions which he had received compelled him to go to\nthe bazaar. There he bought only what had been ordered, but he could\nnot resist the temptation to ask the price of a very handsome\nsheep-skin coat which attracted his attention. The merchant to whom he\nspoke looked at Polikey and smiled, not believing that he had\nsufficient money to purchase such an expensive coat. But Polikey,\npointing to his breast, said that he could buy out the whole shop if he\nwished to. He thereupon ordered the shop-keeper to take his measure. He\ntried the coat on and looked himself over carefully, testing the\nquality and blowing upon the hair to see that none of it came out.\nFinally, heaving a deep sigh, he took it off.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe price is too high,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you could let me have it for\nfifteen rubles\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut the merchant cut him short by snatching the coat from him and\nthrowing it angrily to one side.\n\nPolikey left the bazaar and returned to the merchant\xe2\x80\x99s house in high\nspirits.\n\nAfter supper he went out and fed the mare, and prepared everything for\nthe night. Returning to the house he got up on the stove to rest, and\nwhile there he took out the envelope which contained the money and\nlooked long and earnestly at it. He could not read, but asked one of\nthose present to tell him what the writing on the envelope meant. It\nwas simply the address and the announcement that it contained fifteen\nhundred rubles.\n\nThe envelope was made of common paper and was sealed with dark-brown\nsealing wax. There was one large seal in the centre and four smaller\nones at the corners. Polikey continued to examine it carefully, even\ninserting his finger till he touched the crisp notes. He appeared to\ntake a childish delight in having so much money in his possession.\n\nHaving finished his examination, he put the envelope inside the lining\nof his old battered hat, and placing both under his head he went to\nsleep; but during the night he frequently awoke and always felt to know\nif the money was safe. Each time that he found that it was safe he\nrejoiced at the thought that he, Polikey, abused and regarded by every\none as a thief, was intrusted with the care of such a large sum of\nmoney, and also that he was about to return with it quite as safely as\nthe superintendent himself could have done.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\nBefore dawn the next morning Polikey was up, and after harnessing the\nmare and looking in his hat to see that the money was all right, he\nstarted on his return journey.\n\nMany times on the way Polikey took off his hat to see that the money\nwas safe. Once he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI think that perhaps it would be\nbetter if I should put it in my bosom.\xe2\x80\x9d This would necessitate the\nuntying of his sash, so he decided to keep it still in his hat, or\nuntil he should have made half the journey, when he would be compelled\nto stop to feed his horse and to rest.\n\nHe said to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cThe lining is not sewn in very strongly and the\nenvelope might fall out, so I think I had better not take off my hat\nuntil I reach home.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe money was safe\xe2\x80\x94at least, so it seemed to him\xe2\x80\x94and he began to think\nhow grateful his mistress would be to him, and in his excited\nimagination he saw the five rubles he was so sure of receiving.\n\nOnce more he examined the hat to see that the money was safe, and\nfinding everything all right he put on his hat and pulled it well down\nover his ears, smiling all the while at his own thoughts.\n\nAkulina had carefully sewed all the holes in the hat, but it burst out\nin other places owing to Polikey\xe2\x80\x99s removing it so often.\n\nIn the darkness he did not notice the new rents, and tried to push the\nenvelope further under the lining, and in doing so pushed one corner of\nit through the plush.\n\nThe sun was getting high in the heavens, and Polikey having slept but\nlittle the previous night and feeling its warm rays fell fast asleep,\nafter first pressing his hat more firmly on his head. By this action he\nforced the envelope still further through the plush, and as he rode\nalong his head bobbed up and down.\n\nPolikey did not awake till he arrived near his own house, and his first\nact was to put his hand to his head to learn if his hat was all right.\nFinding that it was in its place, he did not think it necessary to\nexamine it and see that the money was safe. Touching the mare gently\nwith the whip she started into a trot, and as he rode along he arranged\nin his own mind how much he was to receive. With the air of a man\nalready holding a high position at the court, he looked around him with\nan expression of lofty scorn on his face.\n\nAs he neared his house he could see before him the one room which\nconstituted their humble home, and the joiner\xe2\x80\x99s wife next door carrying\nher rolls of linen. He saw also the office of the court and his\nmistress\xe2\x80\x99s house, where he hoped he would be able presently to prove\nthat he was an honest, trustworthy man.\n\nHe reasoned with himself that any person can be abused by lying\ntongues, but when his mistress would see him she would say: \xe2\x80\x9cWell done,\nPolikey; you have shown that you can be honest. Here are three\xe2\x80\x94it may\nbe five\xe2\x80\x94perhaps ten\xe2\x80\x94rubles for you;\xe2\x80\x9d and also she would order tea for\nhim, and might treat him to vodka\xe2\x80\x94who knows?\n\nThe latter thought gave him great pleasure, as he was feeling very\ncold.\n\nSpeaking aloud he said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a happy holy-day we can have with ten\nrubles! Having so much money, I could pay Nikita the four rubles fifty\nkopecks which I owe him, and yet have some left to buy shoes for the\nchildren.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen near the house Polikey began to arrange his clothes, smoothing\ndown his fur collar, re-tying his sash, and stroking his hair. To do\nthe latter he had to take off his hat, and when doing so felt in the\nlining for the envelope. Quicker and quicker he ran his hand around the\nlining, and not finding the money used both hands, first one and then\nthe other. But the envelope was not to be found.\n\nPolikey was by this time greatly distressed, and his face was white\nwith fear as he passed his hand through the crown of his old hat.\nPolikey stopped the mare and began a diligent search through the wagon\nand its contents. Not finding the precious envelope, he felt in all his\npockets\xe2\x80\x94_but the money could not be found!_\n\nWildly clutching at his hair, he exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9c_Batiushka!_ What will I\ndo now? What will become of me?\xe2\x80\x9d At the same time he realized that he\nwas near his neighbors\xe2\x80\x99 house and could be seen by them; so he turned\nthe mare around, and, pulling his hat down securely upon his head, he\nrode quickly back in search of his lost treasure.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\nThe whole day passed without any one in the village of Pokrovski having\nseen anything of Polikey. During the afternoon his mistress inquired\nmany times as to his whereabouts, and sent Aksiutka frequently to\nAkulina, who each time sent back word that Polikey had not yet\nreturned, saying also that perhaps the merchant had kept him, or that\nsomething had happened to the mare.\n\nHis poor wife felt a heavy load upon her heart, and was scarcely able\nto do her housework and put everything in order for the next day (which\nwas to be a holy-day). The children also anxiously awaited their\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s appearance, and, though for different reasons, could hardly\nrestrain their impatience. The noblewoman and Akulina were concerned\nonly in regard to Polikey himself, while the children were interested\nmost in what he would bring them from the town.\n\nThe only news received by the villagers during the day concerning\nPolikey was to the effect that neighboring peasants had seen him\nrunning up and down the road and asking every one he met if he or she\nhad found an envelope.\n\nOne of them had seen him also walking by the side of his tired-out\nhorse. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the man was drunk, and had not fed\nhis horse for two days\xe2\x80\x94the animal looked so exhausted.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nUnable to sleep, and with her heart palpitating at every sound, Akulina\nlay awake all night vainly awaiting Polikey\xe2\x80\x99s return. When the cock\ncrowed the third time she was obliged to get up to attend to the fire.\nDay was just dawning and the church-bells had begun to ring. Soon all\nthe children were also up, but there was still no tidings of the\nmissing husband and father.\n\nIn the morning the chill blasts of winter entered their humble home,\nand on looking out they saw that the houses, fields, and roads were\nthickly covered with snow. The day was clear and cold, as if befitting\nthe holy-day they were about to celebrate. They were able to see a long\ndistance from the house, but no one was in sight.\n\nAkulina was busy baking cakes, and had it not been for the joyous\nshouts of the children she would not have known that Polikey was coming\nup the road, for a few minutes later he came in with a bundle in his\nhand and walked quietly to his corner. Akulina noticed that he was very\npale and that his face bore an expression of suffering\xe2\x80\x94as if he would\nlike to have cried but could not do so. But she did not stop to study\nit, but excitedly inquired: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Illitch, is everything all right\nwith you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe slowly muttered something, but his wife could not understand what he\nsaid.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried out, \xe2\x80\x9chave you been to see our mistress?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPolikey still sat on the bed in his corner, glaring wildly about him,\nand smiling bitterly. He did not reply for a long time, and Akulina\nagain cried:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh? Illitch! Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you answer me? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you speak?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFinally he said: \xe2\x80\x9cAkulina, I delivered the money to our mistress; and\noh, how she thanked me!\xe2\x80\x9d Then he suddenly looked about him, with an\nanxious, startled air, and with a sad smile on his lips. Two things in\nthe room seemed to engross the most of his attention: the baby in the\ncradle, and the rope which was attached to the ladder. Approaching the\ncradle, he began with his thin fingers quickly to untie the knot in the\nrope by which the two were connected. After untying it he stood for a\nfew moments looking silently at the baby.\n\nAkulina did not notice this proceeding, and with her cakes on the board\nwent to place them in a corner.\n\nPolikey quickly hid the rope beneath his coat, and again seated himself\non the bed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it that troubles you, Illitch?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Akulina. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not slept,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\n\nSuddenly a dark shadow crossed the window, and a minute later the girl\nAksiutka quickly entered the room, exclaiming:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe _boyarinia_ commands you, Polikey Illitch, to come to her this\nmoment!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPolikey looked first at Akulina and then at the girl.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis moment!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat more is wanted?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe spoke the last sentence so softly that Akulina became quieted in her\nmind, thinking that perhaps their mistress intended to reward her\nhusband.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay that I will come immediately,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nBut Polikey failed to follow the girl, and went instead to another\nplace.\n\nFrom the porch of his house there was a ladder reaching to the attic.\nArriving at the foot of the ladder Polikey looked around him, and\nseeing no one about, he quickly ascended to the garret.\n\n\nMeanwhile the girl had reached her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s house.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it mean that Polikey does not come?\xe2\x80\x9d said the noblewoman\nimpatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere can he be? Why does he not come at once?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAksiutka flew again to his house and demanded to see Polikey.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe went a long time ago,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Akulina, and looking around with an\nexpression of fear on her face, she added, \xe2\x80\x9cHe may have fallen asleep\nsomewhere on the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAbout this time the joiner\xe2\x80\x99s wife, with hair unkempt and clothes\nbedraggled, went up to the loft to gather the linen which she had\npreviously put there to dry. Suddenly a cry of horror was heard, and\nthe woman, with her eyes closed, and crazed by fear, ran down the\nladder like a cat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIllitch,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9chas hanged himself!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPoor Akulina ran up the ladder before any of the people, who had\ngathered from the surrounding houses, could prevent her. With a loud\nshriek she fell back as if dead, and would surely have been killed had\nnot one of the spectators succeeded in catching her in his arms.\n\nBefore dark the same day a peasant of the village, while returning from\nthe town, found the envelope containing Polikey\xe2\x80\x99s money on the\nroadside, and soon after delivered it to the _boyarinia_.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CANDLE.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe have heard that it hath been said, an eye for an eye and a tooth\nfor a tooth: but I say unto you, That ye resist not evil.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94ST. MATTHEW\nv. 38, 39.\n\n\nIt was in the time of serfdom\xe2\x80\x94many years before Alexander II.\xe2\x80\x99s\nliberation of the sixty million serfs in 1862. In those days the people\nwere ruled by different kinds of lords. There were not a few who,\nremembering God, treated their slaves in a humane manner, and not as\nbeasts of burden, while there were others who were seldom known to\nperform a kind or generous action; but the most barbarous and\ntyrannical of all were those former serfs who arose from the dirt and\nbecame princes.\n\nIt was this latter class who made life literally a burden to those who\nwere unfortunate enough to come under their rule. Many of them had\narisen from the ranks of the peasantry to become superintendents of\nnoblemen\xe2\x80\x99s estates.\n\nThe peasants were obliged to work for their master a certain number of\ndays each week. There was plenty of land and water and the soil was\nrich and fertile, while the meadows and forests were sufficient to\nsupply the needs of both the peasants and their lord.\n\nThere was a certain nobleman who had chosen a superintendent from the\npeasantry on one of his other estates. No sooner had the power to\ngovern been vested in this newly-made official than he began to\npractice the most outrageous cruelties upon the poor serfs who had been\nplaced under his control. Although this man had a wife and two married\ndaughters, and was making so much money that he could have lived\nhappily without transgressing in any way against either God or man, yet\nhe was filled with envy and jealousy and deeply sunk in sin.\n\nMichael Simeonovitch began his persecutions by compelling the peasants\nto perform more days of service on the estate every week than the laws\nobliged them to work. He established a brick-yard, in which he forced\nthe men and women to do excessive labor, selling the bricks for his own\nprofit.\n\nOn one occasion the overworked serfs sent a delegation to Moscow to\ncomplain of their treatment to their lord, but they obtained no\nsatisfaction. When the poor peasants returned disconsolate from the\nnobleman their superintendent determined to have revenge for their\nboldness in going above him for redress, and their life and that of\ntheir fellow-victims became worse than before.\n\nIt happened that among the serfs there were some very treacherous\npeople who would falsely accuse their fellows of wrong-doing and sow\nseeds of discord among the peasantry, whereupon Michael would become\ngreatly enraged, while his poor subjects began to live in fear of their\nlives. When the superintendent passed through the village the people\nwould run and hide themselves as from a wild beast. Seeing thus the\nterror which he had struck to the hearts of the moujiks, Michael\xe2\x80\x99s\ntreatment of them became still more vindictive, so that from over-work\nand ill-usage the lot of the poor serfs was indeed a hard one.\n\nThere was a time when it was possible for the peasants, when driven to\ndespair, to devise means whereby they could rid themselves of an\ninhuman monster such as Simeonovitch, and so these unfortunate people\nbegan to consider whether something could not be done to relieve _them_\nof their intolerable yoke. They would hold little meetings in secret\nplaces to bewail their misery and to confer with one another as to\nwhich would be the best way to act. Now and then the boldest of the\ngathering would rise and address his companions in this strain: \xe2\x80\x9cHow\nmuch longer can we tolerate such a villain to rule over us? Let us make\nan end of it at once, for it were better for us to perish than to\nsuffer. It is surely not a sin to kill such a devil in human form.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt happened once, before the Easter holidays, that one of these\nmeetings was held in the woods, where Michael had sent the serfs to\nmake a clearance for their master. At noon they assembled to eat their\ndinner and to hold a consultation. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy can\xe2\x80\x99t we leave now?\xe2\x80\x9d said one.\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery soon we shall be reduced to nothing. Already we are almost worked\nto death\xe2\x80\x94there being no rest, night or day, either for us or our poor\nwomen. If anything should be done in a way not exactly to please him he\nwill find fault and perhaps flog some of us to death\xe2\x80\x94as was the case\nwith poor Simeon, whom he killed not long ago. Only recently Anisim was\ntortured in irons till he died. We certainly cannot stand this much\nlonger.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said another, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is the use of waiting? Let us act\nat once. Michael will be here this evening, and will be certain to\nabuse us shamefully. Let us, then, thrust him from his horse and with\none blow of an axe give him what he deserves, and thus end our misery.\nWe can then dig a big hole and bury him like a dog, and no one will\nknow what became of him. Now let us come to an agreement\xe2\x80\x94to stand\ntogether as one man and not to betray one another.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe last speaker was Vasili Minayeff, who, if possible, had more cause\nto complain of Michael\xe2\x80\x99s cruelty than any of his fellow-serfs. The\nsuperintendent was in the habit of flogging him severely every week,\nand he took also Vasili\xe2\x80\x99s wife to serve him as cook.\n\nAccordingly, during the evening that followed this meeting in the woods\nMichael arrived on the scene on horseback. He began at once to find\nfault with the manner in which the work had been done, and to complain\nbecause some lime-trees had been cut down.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you not to cut down any lime-trees!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the enraged\nsuperintendent. \xe2\x80\x9cWho did this thing? Tell me at once, or I shall flog\nevery one of you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOn investigation, a peasant named Sidor was pointed out as the guilty\none, and his face was roundly slapped. Michael also severely punished\nVasili, because he had not done sufficient work, after which the master\nrode safely home.\n\nIn the evening the serfs again assembled, and poor Vasili said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\nwhat kind of people _are_ we, anyway? We are only sparrows, and not men\nat all! We agree to stand by each other, but as soon as the time for\naction comes we all run and hide. Once a lot of sparrows conspired\nagainst a hawk, but no sooner did the bird of prey appear than they\nsneaked off in the grass. Selecting one of the choicest sparrows, the\nhawk took it away to eat, after which the others came out crying,\n\xe2\x80\x98Twee-twee!\xe2\x80\x99 and found that one was missing. \xe2\x80\x98Who is killed?\xe2\x80\x99 they\nasked. \xe2\x80\x98Vanka! Well, he deserved it.\xe2\x80\x99 You, my friends, are acting in\njust the same manner. When Michael attacked Sidor you should have stood\nby your promise. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you arise, and with one stroke put an end\nto him and to our misery?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe effect of this speech was to make the peasants more firm in their\ndetermination to kill their superintendent. The latter had already\ngiven orders that they should be ready to plough during the Easter\nholidays, and to sow the field with oats, whereupon the serfs became\nstricken with grief, and gathered in Vasili\xe2\x80\x99s house to hold another\nindignation meeting. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he has really forgotten God,\xe2\x80\x9d they said, \xe2\x80\x9cand\nshall continue to commit such crimes against us, it is truly necessary\nthat we should kill him. If not, let us perish, for it can make no\ndifference to us now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis despairing programme, however, met with considerable opposition\nfrom a peaceably-inclined man named Peter Mikhayeff. \xe2\x80\x9cBrethren,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nhe, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are contemplating a grievous sin. The taking of human life is\na very serious matter. Of course it is easy to end the mortal existence\nof a man, but what will become of the souls of those who commit the\ndeed? If Michael continues to act toward us unjustly God will surely\npunish him. But, my friends, we must have patience.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis pacific utterance only served to intensify the anger of Vasili.\nSaid he: \xe2\x80\x9cPeter is forever repeating the same old story, \xe2\x80\x98It is a sin\nto kill any one.\xe2\x80\x99 Certainly it is sinful to murder; but we should\nconsider the kind of man we are dealing with. We all know it is wrong\nto kill a good man, but even God would take away the life of such a dog\nas he is. It is our duty, if we have any love for mankind, to shoot a\ndog that is mad. It is a sin to let him live. If, therefore, we are to\nsuffer at all, let it be in the interests of the people\xe2\x80\x94and they will\nthank us for it. If we remain quiet any longer a flogging will be our\nonly reward. You are talking nonsense, Mikhayeff. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you think\nof the sin we shall be committing if we work during the Easter\nholidays\xe2\x80\x94for you will refuse to work then yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Peter, \xe2\x80\x9cif they shall send me to plough, I will\ngo. But I shall not be going of my own free will, and God will know\nwhose sin it is, and shall punish the offender accordingly. Yet we must\nnot forget him. Brethren, I am not giving you my own views only. The\nlaw of God is not to return evil for evil; indeed, if you try in this\nway to stamp out wickedness it will come upon you all the stronger. It\nis not difficult for you to kill the man, but his blood will surely\nstain your own soul. You may think you have killed a bad man\xe2\x80\x94that you\nhave gotten rid of evil\xe2\x80\x94but you will soon find out that the seeds of\nstill greater wickedness have been planted within you. If you yield to\nmisfortune it will surely come to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs Peter was not without sympathizers among the peasants, the poor\nserfs were consequently divided into two groups: the followers of\nVasili and those who held the views of Mikhayeff.\n\nOn Easter Sunday no work was done. Toward the evening an elder came to\nthe peasants from the nobleman\xe2\x80\x99s court and said: \xe2\x80\x9cOur superintendent,\nMichael Simeonovitch, orders you to go to-morrow to plough the field\nfor the oats.\xe2\x80\x9d Thus the official went through the village and directed\nthe men to prepare for work the next day\xe2\x80\x94some by the river and others\nby the roadway. The poor people were almost overcome with grief, many\nof them shedding tears, but none dared to disobey the orders of their\nmaster.\n\nOn the morning of Easter Monday, while the church bells were calling\nthe inhabitants to religious services, and while every one else was\nabout to enjoy a holiday, the unfortunate serfs started for the field\nto plough. Michael arose rather late and took a walk about the farm.\nThe domestic servants were through with their work and had dressed\nthemselves for the day, while Michael\xe2\x80\x99s wife and their widowed daughter\n(who was visiting them, as was her custom on holidays) had been to\nchurch and returned. A steaming samovar awaited them, and they began to\ndrink tea with Michael, who, after lighting his pipe, called the elder\nto him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the superintendent, \xe2\x80\x9chave you ordered the moujiks to\nplough to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, I did,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave they all gone to the field?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir; all of them. I directed them myself where to begin.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all very well. You gave the orders, but are they ploughing? Go\nat once and see, and you may tell them that I shall be there after\ndinner. I shall expect to find one and a half acres done for every two\nploughs, and the work must be well done; otherwise they shall be\nseverely punished, notwithstanding the holiday.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear, sir, and obey.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe elder started to go, but Michael called him back. After hesitating\nfor some time, as if he felt very uneasy, he said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, listen to what those scoundrels say about me. Doubtless\nsome of them will curse me, and I want you to report the exact words. I\nknow what villains they are. They don\xe2\x80\x99t find work at all pleasant. They\nwould rather lie down all day and do nothing. They would like to eat\nand drink and make merry on holidays, but they forget that if the\nploughing is not done it will soon be too late. So you go and listen to\nwhat is said, and tell it to me in detail. Go at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear, sir, and obey.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTurning his back and mounting his horse, the elder was soon at the\nfield where the serfs were hard at work.\n\nIt happened that Michael\xe2\x80\x99s wife, a very good-hearted woman, overheard\nthe conversation which her husband had just been holding with the\nelder. Approaching him, she said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good friend, Mishinka [diminutive of Michael], I beg of you to\nconsider the importance and solemnity of this holy-day. Do not sin, for\nChrist\xe2\x80\x99s sake. Let the poor moujiks go home.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMichael laughed, but made no reply to his wife\xe2\x80\x99s humane request.\nFinally he said to her:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve not been whipped for a very long time, and now you have become\nbold enough to interfere in affairs that are not your own.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMishinka,\xe2\x80\x9d she persisted, \xe2\x80\x9cI have had a frightful dream concerning\nyou. You had better let the moujiks go.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cI perceive that you have gained so much flesh of late\nthat you think you would not feel the whip. Lookout!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRudely thrusting his hot pipe against her cheek, Michael chased his\nwife from the room, after which he ordered his dinner. After eating a\nhearty meal consisting of cabbage-soup, roast pig, meat-cake, pastry\nwith milk, jelly, sweet cakes, and vodka, he called his woman cook to\nhim and ordered her to be seated and sing songs, Simeonovitch\naccompanying her on the guitar.\n\nWhile the superintendent was thus enjoying himself to the fullest\nsatisfaction in the musical society of his cook the elder returned,\nand, making a low bow to his superior, proceeded to give the desired\ninformation concerning the serfs.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Michael, \xe2\x80\x9cdid they plough?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the elder; \xe2\x80\x9cthey have accomplished about half the\nfield.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there no fault to be found?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot that I could discover. The work seems to be well done. They are\nevidently afraid of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is the soil?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good. It appears to be quite soft.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Simeonovitch, after a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat did they say about me?\nCursed me, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs the elder hesitated somewhat, Michael commanded him to speak and\ntell him the whole truth. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me all,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cI want to know their\nexact words. If you tell me the truth I shall reward you; but if you\nconceal anything from me you will be punished. See here, Catherine,\npour out a glass of vodka to give him courage!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAfter drinking to the health of his superior, the elder said to\nhimself: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not my fault if they do not praise him. I shall tell\nhim the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d Then turning suddenly to the superintendent he said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey complain, Michael Simeonovitch! They complain bitterly.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what did they say?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Michael. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, one thing they said was, \xe2\x80\x98He does not believe in God.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMichael laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cWho said that?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seemed to be their unanimous opinion. \xe2\x80\x98He has been overcome by the\nEvil One,\xe2\x80\x99 they said.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed the superintendent; \xe2\x80\x9cbut tell me what each of them\nsaid. What did Vasili say?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe elder did not wish to betray his people, but he had a certain\ngrudge against Vasili, and he said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe cursed you more than did any of the others.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what did he say?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is awful to repeat it, sir. Vasili said, \xe2\x80\x98He shall die like a dog,\nhaving no chance to repent!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the villain!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Michael. \xe2\x80\x9cHe would kill me if he were not\nafraid. All right, Vasili; we shall have an accounting with you. And\nTishka\xe2\x80\x94he called me a dog, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder, \xe2\x80\x9cthey all spoke of you in anything but\ncomplimentary terms; but it is mean in me to repeat what they said.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMean or not you must tell me, I say!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome of them declared that your back should be broken.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSimeonovitch appeared to enjoy this immensely, for he laughed outright.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall see whose back will be the first to be broken,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cWas\nthat Tishka\xe2\x80\x99s opinion? While I did not suppose they would say anything\ngood about me, I did not expect such curses and threats. And Peter\nMikhayeff\xe2\x80\x94was that fool cursing me too?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; he did not curse you at all. He appeared to be the only silent one\namong them. Mikhayeff is a very wise moujik, and he surprises me very\nmuch. At his actions all the other peasants seemed amazed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did he do?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did something remarkable. He was diligently ploughing, and as I\napproached him I heard some one singing very sweetly. Looking between\nthe ploughshares, I observed a bright object shining.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what was it? Hurry up!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a small, five-kopeck wax candle, burning brightly, and the wind\nwas unable to blow it out. Peter, wearing a new shirt, sang beautiful\nhymns as he ploughed, and no matter how he handled the implement the\ncandle continued to burn. In my presence he fixed the plough, shaking\nit violently, but the bright little object between the colters remained\nundisturbed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did Mikhayeff say?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said nothing\xe2\x80\x94except when, on seeing me, he gave me the holy-day\nsalutation, after which he went on his way singing and ploughing as\nbefore. I did not say anything to him, but, on approaching the other\nmoujiks, I found that they were laughing and making sport of their\nsilent companion. \xe2\x80\x98It is a great sin to plough on Easter Monday,\xe2\x80\x99 they\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x98You could not get absolution from your sin if you were to pray\nall your life.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did Mikhayeff make no reply?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe stood long enough to say: \xe2\x80\x98There should be peace on earth and\ngood-will to men,\xe2\x80\x99 after which he resumed his ploughing and singing,\nthe candle burning even more brightly than before.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSimeonovitch had now ceased to ridicule, and, putting aside his guitar,\nhis head dropped on his breast and he became lost in thought. Presently\nhe ordered the elder and cook to depart, after which Michael went\nbehind a screen and threw himself upon the bed. He was sighing and\nmoaning, as if in great distress, when his wife came in and spoke\nkindly to him. He refused to listen to her, exclaiming:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has conquered me, and my end is near!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMishinka,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, \xe2\x80\x9carise and go to the moujiks in the field.\nLet them go home, and everything will be all right. Heretofore you have\nrun far greater risks without any fear, but now you appear to be very\nmuch alarmed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has conquered me!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cI am lost!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded his wife, angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you will go and do\nas I tell you there will be no danger. Come, Mishinka,\xe2\x80\x9d she added,\ntenderly; \xe2\x80\x9cI shall have the saddle-horse brought for you at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen the horse arrived the woman persuaded her husband to mount the\nanimal, and to fulfil her request concerning the serfs. When he reached\nthe village a woman opened the gate for him to enter, and as he did so\nthe inhabitants, seeing the brutal superintendent whom everybody\nfeared, ran to hide themselves in their houses, gardens, and other\nsecluded places.\n\nAt length Michael reached the other gate, which he found closed also,\nand, being unable to open it himself while seated on his horse, he\ncalled loudly for assistance. As no one responded to his shouts he\ndismounted and opened the gate, but as he was about to remount, and had\none foot in the stirrup, the horse became frightened at some pigs and\nsprang suddenly to one side. The superintendent fell across the fence\nand a very sharp picket pierced his stomach, when Michael fell\nunconscious to the ground.\n\nToward the evening, when the serfs arrived at the village gate, their\nhorses refused to enter. On looking around, the peasants discovered the\ndead body of their superintendent lying face downward in a pool of\nblood, where he had fallen from the fence. Peter Mikhayeff alone had\nsufficient courage to dismount and approach the prostrate form, his\ncompanions riding around the village and entering by way of the back\nyards. Peter closed the dead man\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, after which he put the body in\na wagon and took it home.\n\nWhen the nobleman learned of the fatal accident which had befallen his\nsuperintendent, and of the brutal treatment which he had meted out to\nthose under him, he freed the serfs, exacting a small rent for the use\nof his land and the other agricultural opportunities.\n\nAnd thus the peasants clearly understood that the power of God is\nmanifested not in evil, but in goodness.\n\n\n\n'b'\ncover \n\n\n\n\nThe Kreutzer Sonata\nand Other Stories\n\nby Leo Tolstoy\n\nTranslated by Benj.

The majority of them\nwere retranslations from the French, and I found that the respective\ntransitions through which they had passed tended to obliterate many of\nthe beauties of the Russian language and of the peculiar\ncharacteristics of Russian life. A satisfactory translation can be made\nonly by one who understands the language and _spirit_ of the Russian\npeople. As Tolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s writings contain so many idioms it is not an easy\ntask to render them into intelligible English, and the one who\nsuccessfully accomplishes this must be a native of Russia, commanding\nthe English and Russian languages with equal fluency.\n\nThe story of \xe2\x80\x9cIvan the Fool\xe2\x80\x9d portrays Tolstoy\xe2\x80\x99s communistic ideas,\ninvolving the abolition of military forces, middlemen, despotism, and\nmoney. Instead of these he would establish on earth a kingdom in which\neach and every person would become a worker and producer. The author\ndescribes the various struggles through which three brothers passed,\nbeset as they were by devils large and small, until they reached the\nideal state of existence which he believes to be the only happy one\nattainable in this world.\n\nOn reading this little story one is surprised that the Russian censor\npassed it, as it is devoted to a narration of ideas quite at variance\nwith the present policy of the government of that country.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Lost Opportunity\xe2\x80\x9d is a singularly true picture of peasant life,\nwhich evinces a deep study of the subject on the part of the writer.\nTolstoy has drawn many of the peculiar customs of the Russian peasant\nin a masterly manner, and I doubt if he has given a more comprehensive\ndescription of this feature of Russian life in any of his other works.\nIn this story also he has presented many traits which are common to\nhuman nature throughout the world, and this gives an added interest to\nthe book. The language is simple and picturesque, and the characters\nare drawn with remarkable fidelity to nature. The moral of this tale\npoints out how the hero Ivan might have avoided the terrible\nconsequences of a quarrel with his neighbor (which grew out of nothing)\nif he had lived in accordance with the scriptural injunction to forgive\nhis brother\xe2\x80\x99s sins and seek not for revenge.\n\nThe story of \xe2\x80\x9cPolikushka\xe2\x80\x9d is a very graphic description of the life led\nby a servant of the court household of a certain nobleman, in which the\nauthor portrays the different conditions and surroundings enjoyed by\nthese servants from those of the ordinary or common peasants. It is a\ntrue and powerful reproduction of an element in Russian life but little\nwritten about heretofore. Like the other stories of this great writer,\n\xe2\x80\x9cPolikushka\xe2\x80\x9d has a moral to which we all might profitably give heed. He\nillustrates the awful consequences of intemperance, and concludes that\nonly kind treatment can reform the victims of alcohol.\n\nFor much valuable assistance in the work of these translations, I am\ndeeply indebted to the bright English scholarship of my devoted wife.\n\n\n\n\nTHE KREUTZER SONATA.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\nTravellers left and entered our car at every stopping of the train.\nThree persons, however, remained, bound, like myself, for the farthest\nstation: a lady neither young nor pretty, smoking cigarettes, with a\nthin face, a cap on her head, and wearing a semi-masculine outer\ngarment; then her companion, a very loquacious gentleman of about forty\nyears, with baggage entirely new and arranged in an orderly manner;\nthen a gentleman who held himself entirely aloof, short in stature,\nvery nervous, of uncertain age, with bright eyes, not pronounced in\ncolor, but extremely attractive,\xe2\x80\x94eyes that darted with rapidity from\none object to another.\n\nThis gentleman, during almost all the journey thus far, had entered\ninto conversation with no fellow-traveller, as if he carefully avoided\nall acquaintance. When spoken to, he answered curtly and decisively,\nand began to look out of the car window obstinately.\n\nYet it seemed to me that the solitude weighed upon him. He seemed to\nperceive that I understood this, and when our eyes met, as happened\nfrequently, since we were sitting almost opposite each other, he turned\naway his head, and avoided conversation with me as much as with the\nothers. At nightfall, during a stop at a large station, the gentleman\nwith the fine baggage\xe2\x80\x94a lawyer, as I have since learned\xe2\x80\x94got out with\nhis companion to drink some tea at the restaurant. During their absence\nseveral new travellers entered the car, among whom was a tall old man,\nshaven and wrinkled, evidently a merchant, wearing a large\nheavily-lined cloak and a big cap. This merchant sat down opposite the\nempty seats of the lawyer and his companion, and straightway entered\ninto conversation with a young man who seemed like an employee in some\ncommercial house, and who had likewise just boarded the train. At first\nthe clerk had remarked that the seat opposite was occupied, and the old\nman had answered that he should get out at the first station. Thus\ntheir conversation started.\n\nI was sitting not far from these two travellers, and, as the train was\nnot in motion, I could catch bits of their conversation when others\nwere not talking.\n\nThey talked first of the prices of goods and the condition of business;\nthey referred to a person whom they both knew; then they plunged into\nthe fair at Nijni Novgorod. The clerk boasted of knowing people who\nwere leading a gay life there, but the old man did not allow him to\ncontinue, and, interrupting him, began to describe the festivities of\nthe previous year at Kounavino, in which he had taken part. He was\nevidently proud of these recollections, and, probably thinking that\nthis would detract nothing from the gravity which his face and manners\nexpressed, he related with pride how, when drunk, he had fired, at\nKounavino, such a broadside that he could describe it only in the\nother\xe2\x80\x99s ear.\n\nThe clerk began to laugh noisily. The old man laughed too, showing two\nlong yellow teeth. Their conversation not interesting me, I left the\ncar to stretch my legs. At the door I met the lawyer and his lady.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no more time,\xe2\x80\x9d the lawyer said to me. \xe2\x80\x9cThe second bell is\nabout to ring.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIndeed I had scarcely reached the rear of the train when the bell\nsounded. As I entered the car again, the lawyer was talking with his\ncompanion in an animated fashion. The merchant, sitting opposite them,\nwas taciturn.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then she squarely declared to her husband,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer with a\nsmile, as I passed by them, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she neither could nor would live with\nhim, because\xe2\x80\x9d . . .\n\nAnd he continued, but I did not hear the rest of the sentence, my\nattention being distracted by the passing of the conductor and a new\ntraveller. When silence was restored, I again heard the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\nThe conversation had passed from a special case to general\nconsiderations.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd afterward comes discord, financial difficulties, disputes between\nthe two parties, and the couple separate. In the good old days that\nseldom happened. Is it not so?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the lawyer of the two merchants,\nevidently trying to drag them into the conversation.\n\nJust then the train started, and the old man, without answering, took\noff his cap, and crossed himself three times while muttering a prayer.\nWhen he had finished, he clapped his cap far down on his head, and\nsaid:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, that happened in former times also, but not as often. In the\npresent day it is bound to happen more frequently. People have become\ntoo learned.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe lawyer made some reply to the old man, but the train, ever\nincreasing its speed, made such a clatter upon the rails that I could\nno longer hear distinctly. As I was interested in what the old man was\nsaying, I drew nearer. My neighbor, the nervous gentleman, was\nevidently interested also, and, without changing his seat, he lent an\near.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what harm is there in education?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the lady, with a smile\nthat was scarcely perceptible. \xe2\x80\x9cWould it be better to marry as in the\nold days, when the bride and bridegroom did not even see each other\nbefore marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, answering, as is the habit of our\nladies, not the words that her interlocutor had spoken, but the words\nshe believed he was going to speak. \xe2\x80\x9cWomen did not know whether they\nwould love or would be loved, and they were married to the first comer,\nand suffered all their lives. Then you think it was better so?\xe2\x80\x9d she\ncontinued, evidently addressing the lawyer and myself, and not at all\nthe old man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople have become too learned,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the last, looking at the\nlady with contempt, and leaving her question unanswered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be curious to know how you explain the correlation between\neducation and conjugal differences,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer, with a slight\nsmile.\n\nThe merchant wanted to make some reply, but the lady interrupted him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, those days are past.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe lawyer cut short her words:\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him express his thought.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause there is no more fear,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how will you marry people who do not love each other? Only animals\ncan be coupled at the will of a proprietor. But people have\ninclinations, attachments,\xe2\x80\x9d the lady hastened to say, casting a glance\nat the lawyer, at me, and even at the clerk, who, standing up and\nleaning his elbow on the back of a seat, was listening to the\nconversation with a smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are wrong to say that, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cThe animals are\nbeasts, but man has received the law.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, nevertheless, how is one to live with a man when there is no\nlove?\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, evidently excited by the general sympathy and\nattention.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFormerly no such distinctions were made,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, gravely.\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly now have they become a part of our habits. As soon as the least\nthing happens, the wife says: \xe2\x80\x98I release you. I am going to leave your\nhouse.\xe2\x80\x99 Even among the moujiks this fashion has become acclimated.\n\xe2\x80\x98There,\xe2\x80\x99 she says, \xe2\x80\x98here are your shirts and drawers. I am going off\nwith Vanka. His hair is curlier than yours.\xe2\x80\x99 Just go talk with them.\nAnd yet the first rule for the wife should be fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe clerk looked at the lawyer, the lady, and myself, evidently\nrepressing a smile, and all ready to deride or approve the merchant\xe2\x80\x99s\nwords, according to the attitude of the others.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat fear?\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis fear,\xe2\x80\x94the wife must fear her husband; that is what fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that, my little father, that is ended.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, madam, that cannot end. As she, Eve, the woman, was taken from\nman\xe2\x80\x99s ribs, so she will remain unto the end of the world,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old\nman, shaking his head so triumphantly and so severely that the clerk,\ndeciding that the victory was on his side, burst into a loud laugh.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you men think so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the lady, without surrendering, and\nturning toward us. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have given yourself liberty. As for woman, you\nwish to keep her in the seraglio. To you, everything is permissible. Is\nit not so?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, man,\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s another affair.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, according to you, to man everything is permissible?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one gives him this permission; only, if the man behaves badly\noutside, the family is not increased thereby; but the woman, the wife,\nis a fragile vessel,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the merchant, severely.\n\nHis tone of authority evidently subjugated his hearers. Even the lady\nfelt crushed, but she did not surrender.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but you will admit, I think, that woman is a human being, and has\nfeelings like her husband. What should she do if she does not love her\nhusband?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she does not love him!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the old man, stormily, and\nknitting his brows; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy, she will be made to love him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis unexpected argument pleased the clerk, and he uttered a murmur of\napprobation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, she will not be forced,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere there is no\nlove, one cannot be obliged to love in spite of herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if the wife deceives her husband, what is to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\nlawyer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat should not happen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cHe must have his eyes\nabout him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if it does happen, all the same? You will admit that it does\nhappen?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt happens among the upper classes, not among us,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the old\nman. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if any husband is found who is such a fool as not to rule his\nwife, he will not have robbed her. But no scandal, nevertheless. Love\nor not, but do not disturb the household. Every husband can govern his\nwife. He has the necessary power. It is only the imbecile who does not\nsucceed in doing so.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEverybody was silent. The clerk moved, advanced, and, not wishing to\nlag behind the others in the conversation, began with his eternal\nsmile:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, in the house of our employer, a scandal has arisen, and it is\nvery difficult to view the matter clearly. The wife loved to amuse\nherself, and began to go astray. He is a capable and serious man.\nFirst, it was with the book-keeper. The husband tried to bring her back\nto reason through kindness. She did not change her conduct. She plunged\ninto all sorts of beastliness. She began to steal his money. He beat\nher, but she grew worse and worse. To an unbaptized, to a pagan, to a\nJew (saving your permission), she went in succession for her caresses.\nWhat could the employer do? He has dropped her entirely, and now he\nlives as a bachelor. As for her, she is dragging in the depths.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is an imbecile,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cIf from the first he had not\nallowed her to go in her own fashion, and had kept a firm hand upon\nher, she would be living honestly, no danger. Liberty must be taken\naway from the beginning. Do not trust yourself to your horse upon the\nhighway. Do not trust yourself to your wife at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt that moment the conductor passed, asking for the tickets for the\nnext station. The old man gave up his.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the feminine sex must be dominated in season, else all will\nperish.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you yourselves, at Kounavino, did you not lead a gay life with the\npretty girls?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the lawyer with a smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s another matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said the merchant, severely. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-by,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nadded, rising. He wrapped himself in his cloak, lifted his cap, and,\ntaking his bag, left the car.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nScarcely had the old man gone when a general conversation began.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a little Old Testament father for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the clerk.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a Domostroy,\xe2\x80\x9d[*] said the lady. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat savage ideas about a woman\nand marriage!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n[*] The Domostroy is a matrimonial code of the days of Ivan the\nTerrible.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are still a long way from the\nEuropean ideas upon marriage. First, the rights of woman, then free\nmarriage, then divorce, as a question not yet solved.\xe2\x80\x9d . . .\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe main thing, and the thing which such people as he do not\nunderstand,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the lady, \xe2\x80\x9cis that only love consecrates\nmarriage, and that the real marriage is that which is consecrated by\nlove.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe clerk listened and smiled, with the air of one accustomed to store\nin his memory all intelligent conversation that he hears, in order to\nmake use of it afterwards.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what is this love that consecrates marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d said, suddenly, the\nvoice of the nervous and taciturn gentleman, who, unnoticed by us, had\napproached.\n\nHe was standing with his hand on the seat, and evidently agitated. His\nface was red, a vein in his forehead was swollen, and the muscles of\nhis cheeks quivered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this love that consecrates marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat love?\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady. \xe2\x80\x9cThe ordinary love of husband and wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how, then, can ordinary love consecrate marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d continued the\nnervous gentleman, still excited, and with a displeased air. He seemed\nto wish to say something disagreeable to the lady. She felt it, and\nbegan to grow agitated.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow? Why, very simply,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\n\nThe nervous gentleman seized the word as it left her lips.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not simply.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam says,\xe2\x80\x9d interceded the lawyer indicating his companion, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\nmarriage should be first the result of an attachment, of a love, if you\nwill, and that, when love exists, and in that case only, marriage\nrepresents something sacred. But every marriage which is not based on a\nnatural attachment, on love, has in it nothing that is morally\nobligatory. Is not that the idea that you intended to convey?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked\nthe lady.\n\nThe lady, with a nod of her head, expressed her approval of this\ntranslation of her thoughts.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the lawyer, continuing his remarks.\n\nBut the nervous gentleman, evidently scarcely able to contain himself,\nwithout allowing the lawyer to finish, asked:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir. But what are we to understand by this love that alone\nconsecrates marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody knows what love is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, and I should like to know how you define it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow? It is very simple,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady.\n\nAnd she seemed thoughtful, and then said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove . . . love . . . is a preference for one man or one woman to the\nexclusion of all others. . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA preference for how long? . . . For a month, two days, or half an\nhour?\xe2\x80\x9d said the nervous gentleman, with special irritation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, permit me, you evidently are not talking of the same thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am talking absolutely of the same thing. Of the preference for\none man or one woman to the exclusion of all others. But I ask: a\npreference for how long?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor how long? For a long time, for a life-time sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that happens only in novels. In life, never. In life this\npreference for one to the exclusion of all others lasts in rare cases\nseveral years, oftener several months, or even weeks, days, hours. . .\n.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sir. Oh, no, no, permit me,\xe2\x80\x9d said all three of us at the same\ntime.\n\nThe clerk himself uttered a monosyllable of disapproval.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, shouting louder than all of us; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are\ntalking of what is believed to exist, and I am talking of what is.\nEvery man feels what you call love toward each pretty woman he sees,\nand very little toward his wife. That is the origin of the proverb,\xe2\x80\x94and\nit is a true one,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Another\xe2\x80\x99s wife is a white swan, and ours is bitter\nwormwood.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but what you say is terrible! There certainly exists among human\nbeings this feeling which is called love, and which lasts, not for\nmonths and years, but for life.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that does not exist. Even if it should be admitted that Menelaus\nhad preferred Helen all his life, Helen would have preferred Paris; and\nso it has been, is, and will be eternally. And it cannot be otherwise,\njust as it cannot happen that, in a load of chick-peas, two peas marked\nwith a special sign should fall side by side. Further, this is not only\nan improbability, but it is certain that a feeling of satiety will come\nto Helen or to Menelaus. The whole difference is that to one it comes\nsooner, to the other later. It is only in stupid novels that it is\nwritten that \xe2\x80\x98they loved each other all their lives.\xe2\x80\x99 And none but\nchildren can believe it. To talk of loving a man or woman for life is\nlike saying that a candle can burn forever.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are talking of physical love. Do you not admit a love based\nupon a conformity of ideals, on a spiritual affinity?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? But in that case it is not necessary to procreate together\n(excuse my brutality). The point is that this conformity of ideals is\nnot met among old people, but among young and pretty persons,\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\nand he began to laugh disagreeably.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I affirm that love, real love, does not consecrate marriage, as\nwe are in the habit of believing, but that, on the contrary, it ruins\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPermit me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer. \xe2\x80\x9cThe facts contradict your words. We see\nthat marriage exists, that all humanity\xe2\x80\x94at least the larger\nportion\xe2\x80\x94lives conjugally, and that many husbands and wives honestly end\na long life together.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe nervous gentleman smiled ill-naturedly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what then? You say that marriage is based upon love, and when I\ngive voice to a doubt as to the existence of any other love than\nsensual love, you prove to me the existence of love by marriage. But in\nour day marriage is only a violence and falsehood.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, pardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer. \xe2\x80\x9cI say only that marriages have\nexisted and do exist.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how and why do they exist? They have existed, and they do exist,\nfor people who have seen, and do see, in marriage something\nsacramental, a sacrament that is binding before God. For such people\nmarriages exist, but to us they are only hypocrisy and violence. We\nfeel it, and, to clear ourselves, we preach free love; but, really, to\npreach free love is only a call backward to the promiscuity of the\nsexes (excuse me, he said to the lady), the haphazard sin of certain\n_raskolniks_. The old foundation is shattered; we must build a new one,\nbut we must not preach debauchery.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe grew so warm that all became silent, looking at him in astonishment.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet the transition state is terrible. People feel that haphazard\nsin is inadmissible. It is necessary in some way or other to regulate\nthe sexual relations; but there exists no other foundation than the old\none, in which nobody longer believes? People marry in the old fashion,\nwithout believing in what they do, and the result is falsehood,\nviolence. When it is falsehood alone, it is easily endured. The husband\nand wife simply deceive the world by professing to live monogamically.\nIf they really are polygamous and polyandrous, it is bad, but\nacceptable. But when, as often happens, the husband and the wife have\ntaken upon themselves the obligation to live together all their lives\n(they themselves do not know why), and from the second month have\nalready a desire to separate, but continue to live together just the\nsame, then comes that infernal existence in which they resort to drink,\nin which they fire revolvers, in which they assassinate each other, in\nwhich they poison each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAll were silent, but we felt ill at ease.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, these critical episodes happen in marital life. For instance,\nthere is the Posdnicheff affair,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer, wishing to stop the\nconversation on this embarrassing and too exciting ground. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you\nread how he killed his wife through jealousy?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe lady said that she had not read it. The nervous gentleman said\nnothing, and changed color.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see that you have divined who I am,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, suddenly, after a\npause.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have not had that pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no great pleasure. I am Posdnicheff.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNew silence. He blushed, then turned pale again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat matters it, however?\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, I do not wish to\nembarrass you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd he resumed his old seat.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nI resumed mine, also. The lawyer and the lady whispered together. I was\nsitting beside Posdnicheff, and I maintained silence. I desired to talk\nto him, but I did not know how to begin, and thus an hour passed until\nwe reached the next station.\n\nThere the lawyer and the lady went out, as well as the clerk. We were\nleft alone, Posdnicheff and I.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say it, and they lie, or they do not understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nPosdnicheff.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf what are you talking?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, still the same thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe leaned his elbows upon his knees, and pressed his hands against his\ntemples.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove, marriage, family,\xe2\x80\x94all lies, lies, lies.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe rose, lowered the lamp-shade, lay down with his elbows on the\ncushion, and closed his eyes. He remained thus for a minute.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it disagreeable to you to remain with me, now that you know who I\nam?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no desire to sleep?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen do you want me to tell you the story of my life?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJust then the conductor passed. He followed him with an ill-natured\nlook, and did not begin until he had gone again. Then during all the\nrest of the story he did not stop once. Even the new travellers as they\nentered did not stop him.\n\nHis face, while he was talking, changed several times so completely\nthat it bore positively no resemblance to itself as it had appeared\njust before. His eyes, his mouth, his moustache, and even his beard,\nall were new. Each time it was a beautiful and touching physiognomy,\nand these transformations were produced suddenly in the penumbra; and\nfor five minutes it was the same face, that could not be compared to\nthat of five minutes before. And then, I know not how, it changed\nagain, and became unrecognizable.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I am going then to tell you my life, and my whole frightful\nhistory,\xe2\x80\x94yes, frightful. And the story itself is more frightful than\nthe outcome.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe became silent for a moment, passed his hands over his eyes, and\nbegan:\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be understood clearly, the whole must be told from the beginning.\nIt must be told how and why I married, and what I was before my\nmarriage. First, I will tell you who I am. The son of a rich gentleman\nof the steppes, an old marshal of the nobility, I was a University\npupil, a graduate of the law school. I married in my thirtieth year.\nBut before talking to you of my marriage, I must tell you how I lived\nformerly, and what ideas I had of conjugal life. I led the life of so\nmany other so-called respectable people,\xe2\x80\x94that is, in debauchery. And\nlike the majority, while leading the life of a _d\xc3\xa9bauch\xc3\xa9_, I was\nconvinced that I was a man of irreproachable morality.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe idea that I had of my morality arose from the fact that in my\nfamily there was no knowledge of those special debaucheries, so common\nin the surroundings of land-owners, and also from the fact that my\nfather and my mother did not deceive each other. In consequence of\nthis, I had built from childhood a dream of high and poetical conjugal\nlife. My wife was to be perfection itself, our mutual love was to be\nincomparable, the purity of our conjugal life stainless. I thought\nthus, and all the time I marvelled at the nobility of my projects.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the same time, I passed ten years of my adult life without hurrying\ntoward marriage, and I led what I called the well-regulated and\nreasonable life of a bachelor. I was proud of it before my friends, and\nbefore all men of my age who abandoned themselves to all sorts of\nspecial refinements. I was not a seducer, I had no unnatural tastes, I\ndid not make debauchery the principal object of my life; but I found\npleasure within the limits of society\xe2\x80\x99s rules, and innocently believed\nmyself a profoundly moral being. The women with whom I had relations\ndid not belong to me alone, and I asked of them nothing but the\npleasure of the moment.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn all this I saw nothing abnormal. On the contrary, from the fact\nthat I did not engage my heart, but paid in cash, I supposed that I was\nhonest. I avoided those women who, by attaching themselves to me, or\npresenting me with a child, could bind my future. Moreover, perhaps\nthere may have been children or attachments; but I so arranged matters\nthat I could not become aware of them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd living thus, I considered myself a perfectly honest man. I did not\nunderstand that debauchery does not consist simply in physical acts,\nthat no matter what physical ignominy does not yet constitute\ndebauchery, and that real debauchery consists in freedom from the moral\nbonds toward a woman with whom one enters into carnal relations, and I\nregarded _this freedom_ as a merit. I remember that I once tortured\nmyself exceedingly for having forgotten to pay a woman who probably had\ngiven herself to me through love. I only became tranquil again when,\nhaving sent her the money, I had thus shown her that I did not consider\nmyself as in any way bound to her. Oh, do not shake your head as if you\nwere in agreement with me (he cried suddenly with vehemence). I know\nthese tricks. All of you, and you especially, if you are not a rare\nexception, have the same ideas that I had then. If you are in agreement\nwith me, it is now only. Formerly you did not think so. No more did I;\nand, if I had been told what I have just told you, that which has\nhappened would not have happened. However, it is all the same. Excuse\nme (he continued): the truth is that it is frightful, frightful,\nfrightful, this abyss of errors and debaucheries in which we live face\nto face with the real question of the rights of woman.\xe2\x80\x9d . . .\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by the \xe2\x80\x98real\xe2\x80\x99 question of the rights of woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe question of the nature of this special being, organized otherwise\nthan man, and how this being and man ought to view the wife. . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes: for ten years I lived the most revolting existence, while\ndreaming of the noblest love, and even in the name of that love. Yes, I\nwant to tell you how I killed my wife, and for that I must tell you how\nI debauched myself. I killed her before I knew her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI killed _the_ wife when I first tasted sensual joys without love, and\nthen it was that I killed _my_ wife. Yes, sir: it is only after having\nsuffered, after having tortured myself, that I have come to understand\nthe root of things, that I have come to understand my crimes. Thus you\nwill see where and how began the drama that has led me to misfortune.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is necessary to go back to my sixteenth year, when I was still at\nschool, and my elder brother a first-year student. I had not yet known\nwomen but, like all the unfortunate children of our society, I was\nalready no longer innocent. I was tortured, as you were, I am sure, and\nas are tortured ninety-nine one-hundredths of our boys. I lived in a\nfrightful dread, I prayed to God, and I prostrated myself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was already perverted in imagination, but the last steps remained to\nbe taken. I could still escape, when a friend of my brother, a very gay\nstudent, one of those who are called good fellows,\xe2\x80\x94that is, the\ngreatest of scamps,\xe2\x80\x94and who had taught us to drink and play cards, took\nadvantage of a night of intoxication to drag us THERE. We started. My\nbrother, as innocent as I, fell that night, and I, a mere lad of\nsixteen, polluted myself and helped to pollute a sister-woman, without\nunderstanding what I did. Never had I heard from my elders that what I\nthus did was bad. It is true that there are the ten commandments of the\nBible; but the commandments are made only to be recited before the\npriests at examinations, and even then are not as exacting as the\ncommandments in regard to the use of _ut_ in conditional propositions.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus, from my elders, whose opinion I esteemed, I had never heard that\nthis was reprehensible. On the contrary, I had heard people whom I\nrespected say that it was good. I had heard that my struggles and my\nsufferings would be appeased after this act. I had heard it and read\nit. I had heard from my elders that it was excellent for the health,\nand my friends have always seemed to believe that it contained I know\nnot what merit and valor. So nothing is seen in it but what is\npraiseworthy. As for the danger of disease, it is a foreseen danger.\nDoes not the government guard against it? And even science corrupts\nus.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow so, science?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the doctors, the pontiffs of science. Who pervert young people by\nlaying down such rules of hygiene? Who pervert women by devising and\nteaching them ways by which not to have children?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes: if only a hundredth of the efforts spent in curing diseases were\nspent in curing debauchery, disease would long ago have ceased to\nexist, whereas now all efforts are employed, not in extirpating\ndebauchery, but in favoring it, by assuring the harmlessness of the\nconsequences. Besides, it is not a question of that. It is a question\nof this frightful thing that has happened to me, as it happens to\nnine-tenths, if not more, not only of the men of our society, but of\nall societies, even peasants,\xe2\x80\x94this frightful thing that I had fallen,\nand not because I was subjected to the natural seduction of a certain\nwoman. No, no woman seduced me. I fell because the surroundings in\nwhich I found myself saw in this degrading thing only a legitimate\nfunction, useful to the health; because others saw in it simply a\nnatural amusement, not only excusable, but even innocent in a young\nman. I did not understand that it was a fall, and I began to give\nmyself to those pleasures (partly from desire and partly from\nnecessity) which I was led to believe were characteristic of my age,\njust as I had begun to drink and smoke.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet there was in this first fall something peculiar and touching.\nI remember that straightway I was filled with such a profound sadness\nthat I had a desire to weep, to weep over the loss forever of my\nrelations with woman. Yes, my relations with woman were lost forever.\nPure relations with women, from that time forward, I could no longer\nhave. I had become what is called a voluptuary; and to be a voluptuary\nis a physical condition like the condition of a victim of the morphine\nhabit, of a drunkard, and of a smoker.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as the victim of the morphine habit, the drunkard, the smoker, is\nno longer a normal man, so the man who has known several women for his\npleasure is no longer normal? He is abnormal forever. He is a\nvoluptuary. Just as the drunkard and the victim of the morphine habit\nmay be recognized by their face and manner, so we may recognize a\nvoluptuary. He may repress himself and struggle, but nevermore will he\nenjoy simple, pure, and fraternal relations toward woman. By his way of\nglancing at a young woman one may at once recognize a voluptuary; and I\nbecame a voluptuary, and I have remained one.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, so it is; and that went farther and farther with all sorts of\nvariations. My God! when I remember all my cowardly acts and bad deeds,\nI am frightened. And I remember that \xe2\x80\x98me\xe2\x80\x99 who, during that period, was\nstill the butt of his comrades\xe2\x80\x99 ridicule on account of his innocence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when I hear people talk of the gilded youth, of the officers, of\nthe Parisians, and all these gentlemen, and myself, living wild lives\nat the age of thirty, and who have on our consciences hundreds of\ncrimes toward women, terrible and varied, when we enter a parlor or a\nball-room, washed, shaven, and perfumed, with very white linen, in\ndress coats or in uniform, as emblems of purity, oh, the disgust! There\nwill surely come a time, an epoch, when all these lives and all this\ncowardice will be unveiled!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, nevertheless, I lived, until the age of thirty, without abandoning\nfor a minute my intention of marrying, and building an elevated\nconjugal life; and with this in view I watched all young girls who\nmight suit me. I was buried in rottenness, and at the same time I\nlooked for virgins, whose purity was worthy of me! Many of them were\nrejected: they did not seem to me pure enough!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFinally I found one that I considered on a level with myself. She was\none of two daughters of a landed proprietor of Penza, formerly very\nrich and since ruined. To tell the truth, without false modesty, they\npursued me and finally captured me. The mother (the father was away)\nlaid all sorts of traps, and one of these, a trip in a boat, decided my\nfuture.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI made up my mind at the end of the aforesaid trip one night, by\nmoonlight, on our way home, while I was sitting beside her. I admired\nher slender body, whose charming shape was moulded by a jersey, and her\ncurling hair, and I suddenly concluded that _this was she_. It seemed\nto me on that beautiful evening that she understood all that I thought\nand felt, and I thought and felt the most elevating things.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, it was only the jersey that was so becoming to her, and her\ncurly hair, and also the fact that I had spent the day beside her, and\nthat I desired a more intimate relation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI returned home enthusiastic, and I persuaded myself that she realized\nthe highest perfection, and that for that reason she was worthy to be\nmy wife, and the next day I made to her a proposal of marriage.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, say what you will, we live in such an abyss of falsehood, that,\nunless some event strikes us a blow on the head, as in my case, we\ncannot awaken. What confusion! Out of the thousands of men who marry,\nnot only among us, but also among the people, scarcely will you find a\nsingle one who has not previously married at least ten times. (It is\ntrue that there now exist, at least so I have heard, pure young people\nwho feel and know that this is not a joke, but a serious matter. May\nGod come to their aid! But in my time there was not to be found one\nsuch in a thousand.)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd all know it, and pretend not to know it. In all the novels are\ndescribed down to the smallest details the feelings of the characters,\nthe lakes and brambles around which they walk; but, when it comes to\ndescribing their _great_ love, not a word is breathed of what _He_, the\ninteresting character, has previously done, not a word about his\nfrequenting of disreputable houses, or his association with\nnursery-maids, cooks, and the wives of others.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if anything is said of these things, such _improper_ novels are\nnot allowed in the hands of young girls. All men have the air of\nbelieving, in presence of maidens, that these corrupt pleasures, in\nwhich _everybody_ takes part, do not exist, or exist only to a very\nsmall extent. They pretend it so carefully that they succeed in\nconvincing themselves of it. As for the poor young girls, they believe\nit quite seriously, just as my poor wife believed it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember that, being already engaged, I showed her my \xe2\x80\x98memoirs,\xe2\x80\x99\nfrom which she could learn more or less of my past, and especially my\nlast _liaison_ which she might perhaps have discovered through the\ngossip of some third party. It was for this last reason, for that\nmatter, that I felt the necessity of communicating these memoirs to\nher. I can still see her fright, her despair, her bewilderment, when\nshe had learned and understood it. She was on the point of breaking the\nengagement. What a lucky thing it would have been for both of us!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPosdnicheff was silent for a moment, and then resumed:\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, no! It is better that things happened as they did, better!\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe cried. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a good thing for me. Besides, it makes no difference.\nI was saying that in these cases it is the poor young girls who are\ndeceived. As for the mothers, the mothers especially, informed by their\nhusbands, they know all, and, while pretending to believe in the purity\nof the young man, they act as if they did not believe in it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey know what bait must be held out to people for themselves and\ntheir daughters. We men sin through ignorance, and a determination not\nto learn. As for the women, they know very well that the noblest and\nmost poetic love, as we call it, depends, not on moral qualities, but\non the physical intimacy, and also on the manner of doing the hair, and\nthe color and shape.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk an experienced coquette, who has undertaken to seduce a man, which\nshe would prefer,\xe2\x80\x94to be convicted, in presence of the man whom she is\nengaged in conquering, of falsehood, perversity, cruelty, or to appear\nbefore him in an ill-fitting dress, or a dress of an unbecoming color.\nShe will prefer the first alternative. She knows very well that we\nsimply lie when we talk of our elevated sentiments, that we seek only\nthe possession of her body, and that because of that we will forgive\nher every sort of baseness, but will not forgive her a costume of an\nugly shade, without taste or fit.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd these things she knows by reason, where as the maiden knows them\nonly by instinct, like the animal. Hence these abominable jerseys,\nthese artificial humps on the back, these bare shoulders, arms, and\nthroats.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWomen, especially those who have passed through the school of\nmarriage, know very well that conversations upon elevated subjects are\nonly conversations, and that man seeks and desires the body and all\nthat ornaments the body. Consequently, they act accordingly? If we\nreject conventional explanations, and view the life of our upper and\nlower classes as it is, with all its shamelessness, it is only a vast\nperversity. You do not share this opinion? Permit me, I am going to\nprove it to you (said he, interrupting me).\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say that the women of our society live for a different interest\nfrom that which actuates fallen women. And I say no, and I am going to\nprove it to you. If beings differ from one another according to the\npurpose of their life, according to their _inner life_, this will\nnecessarily be reflected also in their _outer life_, and their exterior\nwill be very different. Well, then, compare the wretched, the despised,\nwith the women of the highest society: the same dresses, the same\nfashions, the same perfumeries, the same passion for jewelry, for\nbrilliant and very expensive articles, the same amusements, dances,\nmusic, and songs. The former attract by all possible means; so do the\nlatter. No difference, none whatever!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and I, too, was captivated by jerseys, bustles, and curly hair.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it was very easy to capture me, since I was brought up under\nartificial conditions, like cucumbers in a hothouse. Our too abundant\nnourishment, together with complete physical idleness, is nothing but\nsystematic excitement of the imagination. The men of our society are\nfed and kept like reproductive stallions. It is sufficient to close the\nvalve,\xe2\x80\x94that is, for a young man to live a quiet life for some time,\xe2\x80\x94to\nproduce as an immediate result a restlessness, which, becoming\nexaggerated by reflection through the prism of our unnatural life,\nprovokes the illusion of love.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll our idyls and marriage, all, are the result for the most part of\nour eating. Does that astonish you? For my part, I am astonished that\nwe do not see it. Not far from my estate this spring some moujiks were\nworking on a railway embankment. You know what a peasant\xe2\x80\x99s food\nis,\xe2\x80\x94bread, _kvass_,[*] onions. With this frugal nourishment he lives,\nhe is alert, he makes light work in the fields. But on the railway this\nbill of fare becomes _cacha_ and a pound of meat. Only he restores this\nmeat by sixteen hours of labor pushing loads weighing twelve hundred\npounds.\n\n[*] _Kvass_, a sort of cider.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we, who eat two pounds of meat and game, we who absorb all sorts\nof heating drinks and food, how do we expend it? In sensual excesses.\nIf the valve is open, all goes well; but close it, as I had closed it\ntemporarily before my marriage, and immediately there will result an\nexcitement which, deformed by novels, verses, music, by our idle and\nluxurious life, will give a love of the finest water. I, too, fell in\nlove, as everybody does, and there were transports, emotions, poesy;\nbut really all this passion was prepared by mamma and the dressmakers.\nIf there had been no trips in boats, no well-fitted garments, etc., if\nmy wife had worn some shapeless blouse, and I had seen her thus at her\nhome, I should not have been seduced.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd note, also, this falsehood, of which all are guilty; the way in\nwhich marriages are made. What could there be more natural? The young\ngirl is marriageable, she should marry. What simpler, provided the\nyoung person is not a monster, and men can be found with a desire to\nmarry? Well, no, here begins a new hypocrisy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFormerly, when the maiden arrived at a favorable age, her marriage was\narranged by her parents. That was done, that is done still, throughout\nhumanity, among the Chinese, the Hindoos, the Mussulmans, and among our\ncommon people also. Things are so managed in at least ninety-nine per\ncent. of the families of the entire human race.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly we riotous livers have imagined that this way was bad, and have\ninvented another. And this other,\xe2\x80\x94what is it? It is this. The young\ngirls are seated, and the gentlemen walk up and down before them, as in\na bazaar, and make their choice. The maidens wait and think, but do not\ndare to say: \xe2\x80\x98Take me, young man, me and not her. Look at these\nshoulders and the rest.\xe2\x80\x99 We males walk up and down, and estimate the\nmerchandise, and then we discourse upon the rights of woman, upon the\nliberty that she acquires, I know not how, in the theatrical halls.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what is to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d said I to him. \xe2\x80\x9cShall the woman make the\nadvances?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know. But, if it is a question of equality, let the equality\nbe complete. Though it has been found that to contract marriages\nthrough the agency of match-makers is humiliating, it is nevertheless a\nthousand times preferable to our system. There the rights and the\nchances are equal; here the woman is a slave, exhibited in the market.\nBut as she cannot bend to her condition, or make advances herself,\nthere begins that other and more abominable lie which is sometimes\ncalled _going into society_, sometimes _amusing one\xe2\x80\x99s self_, and which\nis really nothing but the hunt for a husband.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut say to a mother or to her daughter that they are engaged only in a\nhunt for a husband. God! What an offence! Yet they can do nothing else,\nand have nothing else to do; and the terrible feature of it all is to\nsee sometimes very young, poor, and innocent maidens haunted solely by\nsuch ideas. If only, I repeat, it were done frankly; but it is always\naccompanied with lies and babble of this sort:\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Ah, the descent of species! How interesting it is!\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Lily is much interested in painting.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Shall you go to the Exposition? How charming it is!\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And the troika, and the plays, and the symphony. Ah, how adorable!\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98My Lise is passionately fond of music.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And you, why do you not share these convictions?\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd through all this verbiage, all have but one single idea: \xe2\x80\x98Take me,\ntake my Lise. No, me! Only try!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know,\xe2\x80\x9d suddenly continued Posdnicheff, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this power of\nwomen from which the world suffers arises solely from what I have just\nspoken of?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by the power of women?\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody, on the\ncontrary, complains that women have not sufficient rights, that they\nare in subjection.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it; that\xe2\x80\x99s it exactly,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, vivaciously. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is just\nwhat I mean, and that is the explanation of this extraordinary\nphenomenon, that on the one hand woman is reduced to the lowest degree\nof humiliation and on the other hand she reigns over everything. See\nthe Jews: with their power of money, they avenge their subjection, just\nas the women do. \xe2\x80\x98Ah! you wish us to be only merchants? All right;\nremaining merchants, we will get possession of you,\xe2\x80\x99 say the Jews. \xe2\x80\x98Ah!\nyou wish us to be only objects of sensuality? All right; by the aid of\nsensuality we will bend you beneath our yoke,\xe2\x80\x99 say the women.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe absence of the rights of woman does not consist in the fact that\nshe has not the right to vote, or the right to sit on the bench, but in\nthe fact that in her affectional relations she is not the equal of man,\nshe has not the right to abstain, to choose instead of being chosen.\nYou say that that would be abnormal. Very well! But then do not let man\nenjoy these rights, while his companion is deprived of them, and finds\nherself obliged to make use of the coquetry by which she governs, so\nthat the result is that man chooses \xe2\x80\x98formally,\xe2\x80\x99 whereas really it is\nwoman who chooses. As soon as she is in possession of her means, she\nabuses them, and acquires a terrible supremacy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where do you see this exceptional power?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere? Why, everywhere, in everything. Go see the stores in the large\ncities. There are millions there, millions. It is impossible to\nestimate the enormous quantity of labor that is expended there. In\nnine-tenths of these stores is there anything whatever for the use of\nmen? All the luxury of life is demanded and sustained by woman. Count\nthe factories; the greater part of them are engaged in making feminine\nornaments. Millions of men, generations of slaves, die toiling like\nconvicts simply to satisfy the whims of our companions.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWomen, like queens, keep nine-tenths of the human race as prisoners of\nwar, or as prisoners at hard labor. And all this because they have been\nhumiliated, because they have been deprived of rights equal to those\nwhich men enjoy. They take revenge for our sensuality; they catch us in\ntheir nets.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the whole thing is there. Women have made of themselves such a\nweapon to act upon the senses that a young man, and even an old man,\ncannot remain tranquil in their presence. Watch a popular festival, or\nour receptions or ball-rooms. Woman well knows her influence there. You\nwill see it in her triumphant smiles.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as a young man advances toward a woman, directly he falls\nunder the influence of this opium, and loses his head. Long ago I felt\nill at ease when I saw a woman too well adorned,\xe2\x80\x94whether a woman of the\npeople with her red neckerchief and her looped skirt, or a woman of our\nown society in her ball-room dress. But now it simply terrifies me. I\nsee in it a danger to men, something contrary to the laws; and I feel a\ndesire to call a policeman, to appeal for defence from some quarter, to\ndemand that this dangerous object be removed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this is not a joke, by any means. I am convinced, I am sure, that\nthe time will come\xe2\x80\x94and perhaps it is not far distant\xe2\x80\x94when the world\nwill understand this, and will be astonished that a society could exist\nin which actions as harmful as those which appeal to sensuality by\nadorning the body as our companions do were allowed. As well set traps\nalong our public streets, or worse than that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat, then, was the way in which I was captured. I was in love, as it\nis called; not only did _she_ appear to me a perfect being, but I\nconsidered myself a white blackbird. It is a commonplace fact that\nthere is no one so low in the world that he cannot find some one viler\nthan himself, and consequently puff with pride and self-contentment. I\nwas in that situation. I did not marry for money. Interest was foreign\nto the affair, unlike the marriages of most of my acquaintances, who\nmarried either for money or for relations. First, I was rich, she was\npoor. Second, I was especially proud of the fact that, while others\nmarried with an intention of continuing their polygamic life as\nbachelors, it was my firm intention to live monogamically after my\nengagement and the wedding, and my pride swelled immeasurably.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I was a wretch, convinced that I was an angel. The period of my\nengagement did not last long. I cannot remember those days without\nshame. What an abomination!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is generally agreed that love is a moral sentiment, a community of\nthought rather than of sense. If that is the case, this community of\nthought ought to find expression in words and conversation. Nothing of\nthe sort. It was extremely difficult for us to talk with each other.\nWhat a toil of Sisyphus was our conversation! Scarcely had we thought\nof something to say, and said it, when we had to resume our silence and\ntry to discover new subjects. Literally, we did not know what to say to\neach other. All that we could think of concerning the life that was\nbefore us and our home was said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then what? If we had been animals, we should have known that we\nhad not to talk. But here, on the contrary, it was necessary to talk,\nand there were no resources! For that which occupied our minds was not\na thing to be expressed in words.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then that silly custom of eating bon-bons, that brutal gluttony\nfor sweetmeats, those abominable preparations for the wedding, those\ndiscussions with mamma upon the apartments, upon the sleeping-rooms,\nupon the bedding, upon the morning-gowns, upon the wrappers, the linen,\nthe costumes! Understand that if people married according to the old\nfashion, as this old man said just now, then these eiderdown coverlets\nand this bedding would all be sacred details; but with us, out of ten\nmarried people there is scarcely to be found one who, I do not say\nbelieves in sacraments (whether he believes or not is a matter of\nindifference to us), but believes in what he promises. Out of a hundred\nmen, there is scarcely one who has not married before, and out of fifty\nscarcely one who has not made up his mind to deceive his wife.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe great majority look upon this journey to the church as a condition\nnecessary to the possession of a certain woman. Think then of the\nsupreme significance which material details must take on. Is it not a\nsort of sale, in which a maiden is given over to a _d\xc3\xa9bauch\xc3\xa9_, the sale\nbeing surrounded with the most agreeable details?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll marry in this way. And I did like the rest. If the young people\nwho dream of the honeymoon only knew what a disillusion it is, and\nalways a disillusion! I really do not know why all think it necessary\nto conceal it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne day I was walking among the shows in Paris, when, attracted by a\nsign, I entered an establishment to see a bearded woman and a\nwater-dog. The woman was a man in disguise, and the dog was an ordinary\ndog, covered with a sealskin, and swimming in a bath. It was not in the\nleast interesting, but the Barnum accompanied me to the exit very\ncourteously, and, in addressing the people who were coming in, made an\nappeal to my testimony. \xe2\x80\x98Ask the gentleman if it is not worth seeing!\nCome in, come in! It only costs a franc!\xe2\x80\x99 And in my confusion I did not\ndare to answer that there was nothing curious to be seen, and it was\nupon my false shame that the Barnum must have counted.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be the same with the persons who have passed through the\nabominations of the honeymoon. They do not dare to undeceive their\nneighbor. And I did the same.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe felicities of the honeymoon do not exist. On the contrary, it is a\nperiod of uneasiness, of shame, of pity, and, above all, of _ennui_,\xe2\x80\x94of\nferocious _ennui_. It is something like the feeling of a youth when he\nis beginning to smoke. He desires to vomit; he drivels, and swallows\nhis drivel, pretending to enjoy this little amusement. The vice of\nmarriage . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! _Vice?_\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you are talking of one of the most natural\nthings.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNatural!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cNatural! No, I consider on the contrary that it is\nagainst nature, and it is I, a perverted man, who have reached this\nconviction. What would it be, then, if I had not known corruption? To a\nyoung girl, to every unperverted young girl, it is an act extremely\nunnatural, just as it is to children. My sister married, when very\nyoung, a man twice her own age, and who was utterly corrupt. I remember\nhow astonished we were the night of her wedding, when, pale and covered\nwith tears, she fled from her husband, her whole body trembling, saying\nthat for nothing in the world would she tell what he wanted of her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say natural? It is natural to eat; that is a pleasant, agreeable\nfunction, which no one is ashamed to perform from the time of his\nbirth. No, it is not natural. A pure young girl wants one\nthing,\xe2\x80\x94children. Children, yes, not a lover.\xe2\x80\x9d . . .\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, with astonishment, \xe2\x80\x9chow would the human race continue?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what is the use of its continuing?\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined, vehemently.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! What is the use? But then we should not exist.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why is it necessary that we should exist?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, to live, to be sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why live? The Schopenhauers, the Hartmanns, and all the Buddhists,\nsay that the greatest happiness is Nirvana, Non-Life; and they are\nright in this sense,\xe2\x80\x94that human happiness is coincident with the\nannihilation of \xe2\x80\x98Self.\xe2\x80\x99 Only they do not express themselves well. They\nsay that Humanity should annihilate itself to avoid its sufferings,\nthat its object should be to destroy itself. Now the object of Humanity\ncannot be to avoid sufferings by annihilation, since suffering is the\nresult of activity. The object of activity cannot consist in\nsuppressing its consequences. The object of Man, as of Humanity, is\nhappiness, and, to attain it, Humanity has a law which it must carry\nout. This law consists in the union of beings. This union is thwarted\nby the passions. And that is why, if the passions disappear, the union\nwill be accomplished. Humanity then will have carried out the law, and\nwill have no further reason to exist.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd before Humanity carries out the law?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the meantime it will have the sign of the unfulfilled law, and the\nexistence of physical love. As long as this love shall exist, and\nbecause of it, generations will be born, one of which will finally\nfulfil the law. When at last the law shall be fulfilled, the Human Race\nwill be annihilated. At least it is impossible for us to conceive of\nLife in the perfect union of people.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrange theory!\xe2\x80\x9d cried I.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrange in what? According to all the doctrines of the Church, the\nworld will have an end. Science teaches the same fatal conclusions.\nWhy, then, is it strange that the same thing should result from moral\nDoctrine? \xe2\x80\x98Let those who can, contain,\xe2\x80\x99 said Christ. And I take this\npassage literally, as it is written. That morality may exist between\npeople in their worldly relations, they must make complete chastity\ntheir object. In tending toward this end, man humiliates himself. When\nhe shall reach the last degree of humiliation, we shall have moral\nmarriage.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if man, as in our society, tends only toward physical love, though\nhe may clothe it with pretexts and the false forms of marriage, he will\nhave only permissible debauchery, he will know only the same immoral\nlife in which I fell and caused my wife to fall, a life which we call\nthe honest life of the family. Think what a perversion of ideas must\narise when the happiest situation of man, liberty, chastity, is looked\nupon as something wretched and ridiculous. The highest ideal, the best\nsituation of woman, to be pure, to be a vestal, a virgin, excites fear\nand laughter in our society. How many, how many young girls sacrifice\ntheir purity to this Moloch of opinion by marrying rascals that they\nmay not remain virgins,\xe2\x80\x94that is, superiors! Through fear of finding\nthemselves in that ideal state, they ruin themselves.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I did not understand formerly, I did not understand that the words\nof the Gospel, that \xe2\x80\x98he who looks upon a woman to lust after her has\nalready committed adultery,\xe2\x80\x99 do not apply to the wives of others, but\nnotably and especially to our own wives. I did not understand this, and\nI thought that the honeymoon and all of my acts during that period were\nvirtuous, and that to satisfy one\xe2\x80\x99s desires with his wife is an\neminently chaste thing. Know, then, that I consider these departures,\nthese isolations, which young married couples arrange with the\npermission of their parents, as nothing else than a license to engage\nin debauchery.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw, then, in this nothing bad or shameful, and, hoping for great\njoys, I began to live the honeymoon. And very certainly none of these\njoys followed. But I had faith, and was determined to have them, cost\nwhat they might. But the more I tried to secure them, the less I\nsucceeded. All this time I felt anxious, ashamed, and weary. Soon I\nbegan to suffer. I believe that on the third or fourth day I found my\nwife sad and asked her the reason. I began to embrace her, which in my\nopinion was all that she could desire. She put me away with her hand,\nand began to weep.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt what? She could not tell me. She was filled with sorrow, with\nanguish. Probably her tortured nerves had suggested to her the truth\nabout the baseness of our relations, but she found no words in which to\nsay it. I began to question her; she answered that she missed her\nabsent mother. It seemed to me that she was not telling the truth. I\nsought to console her by maintaining silence in regard to her parents.\nI did not imagine that she felt herself simply overwhelmed, and that\nher parents had nothing to do with her sorrow. She did not listen to\nme, and I accused her of caprice. I began to laugh at her gently. She\ndried her tears, and began to reproach me, in hard and wounding terms,\nfor my selfishness and cruelty.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI looked at her. Her whole face expressed hatred, and hatred of me. I\ncannot describe to you the fright which this sight gave me. \xe2\x80\x98How?\nWhat?\xe2\x80\x99 thought I, \xe2\x80\x98love is the unity of souls, and here she hates me?\nMe? Why? But it is impossible! It is no longer she!\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tried to calm her. I came in conflict with an immovable and cold\nhostility, so that, having no time to reflect, I was seized with keen\nirritation. We exchanged disagreeable remarks. The impression of this\nfirst quarrel was terrible. I say quarrel, but the term is inexact. It\nwas the sudden discovery of the abyss that had been dug between us.\nLove was exhausted with the satisfaction of sensuality. We stood face\nto face in our true light, like two egoists trying to procure the\ngreatest possible enjoyment, like two individuals trying to mutually\nexploit each other.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo what I called our quarrel was our actual situation as it appeared\nafter the satisfaction of sensual desire. I did not realize that this\ncold hostility was our normal state, and that this first quarrel would\nsoon be drowned under a new flood of the intensest sensuality. I\nthought that we had disputed with each other, and had become\nreconciled, and that it would not happen again. But in this same\nhoneymoon there came a period of satiety, in which we ceased to be\nnecessary to each other, and a new quarrel broke out.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt became evident that the first was not a matter of chance. \xe2\x80\x98It was\ninevitable,\xe2\x80\x99 I thought. This second quarrel stupefied me the more,\nbecause it was based on an extremely unjust cause. It was something\nlike a question of money,\xe2\x80\x94and never had I haggled on that score; it was\neven impossible that I should do so in relation to her. I only remember\nthat, in answer to some remark that I made, she insinuated that it was\nmy intention to rule her by means of money, and that it was upon money\nthat I based my sole right over her. In short, something\nextraordinarily stupid and base, which was neither in my character nor\nin hers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was beside myself. I accused her of indelicacy. She made the same\naccusation against me, and the dispute broke out. In her words, in the\nexpression of her face, of her eyes, I noticed again the hatred that\nhad so astonished me before. With a brother, friends, my father, I had\noccasionally quarrelled, but never had there been between us this\nfierce spite. Some time passed. Our mutual hatred was again concealed\nbeneath an access of sensual desire, and I again consoled myself with\nthe reflection that these scenes were reparable faults.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut when they were repeated a third and a fourth time, I understood\nthat they were not simply faults, but a fatality that must happen\nagain. I was no longer frightened, I was simply astonished that I\nshould be precisely the one to live so uncomfortably with my wife, and\nthat the same thing did not happen in other households. I did not know\nthat in all households the same sudden changes take place, but that\nall, like myself, imagine that it is a misfortune exclusively reserved\nfor themselves alone, which they carefully conceal as shameful, not\nonly to others, but to themselves, like a bad disease.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was what happened to me. Begun in the early days, it continued\nand increased with characteristics of fury that were ever more\npronounced. At the bottom of my soul, from the first weeks, I felt that\nI was in a trap, that I had what I did not expect, and that marriage is\nnot a joy, but a painful trial. Like everybody else, I refused to\nconfess it (I should not have confessed it even now but for the\noutcome). Now I am astonished to think that I did not see my real\nsituation. It was so easy to perceive it, in view of those quarrels,\nbegun for reasons so trivial that afterwards one could not recall them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as it often happens among gay young people that, in the absence\nof jokes, they laugh at their own laughter, so we found no reasons for\nour hatred, and we hated each other because hatred was naturally\nboiling up in us. More extraordinary still was the absence of causes\nfor reconciliation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes words, explanations, or even tears, but sometimes, I\nremember, after insulting words, there tacitly followed embraces and\ndeclarations. Abomination! Why is it that I did not then perceive this\nbaseness?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll of us, men and women, are brought up in these aberrations of\nfeeling that we call love. I from childhood had prepared myself for\nthis thing, and I loved, and I loved during all my youth, and I was\njoyous in loving. It had been put into my head that it was the noblest\nand highest occupation in the world. But when this expected feeling\ncame at last, and I, a man, abandoned myself to it, the lie was pierced\nthrough and through. Theoretically a lofty love is conceivable;\npractically it is an ignoble and degrading thing, which it is equally\ndisgusting to talk about and to remember. It is not in vain that nature\nhas made ceremonies, but people pretend that the ignoble and the\nshameful is beautiful and lofty.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you brutally and briefly what were the first signs of my\nlove. I abandoned myself to beastly excesses, not only not ashamed of\nthem, but proud of them, giving no thought to the intellectual life of\nmy wife. And not only did I not think of her intellectual life, I did\nnot even consider her physical life.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was astonished at the origin of our hostility, and yet how clear it\nwas! This hostility is nothing but a protest of human nature against\nthe beast that enslaves it. It could not be otherwise. This hatred was\nthe hatred of accomplices in a crime. Was it not a crime that, this\npoor woman having become pregnant in the first month, our _liaison_\nshould have continued just the same?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou imagine that I am wandering from my story. Not at all. I am always\ngiving you an account of the events that led to the murder of my wife.\nThe imbeciles! They think that I killed my wife on the 5th of October.\nIt was long before that that I immolated her, just as they all kill\nnow. Understand well that in our society there is an idea shared by all\nthat woman procures man pleasure (and _vice versa_, probably, but I\nknow nothing of that, I only know my own case). _Wein, Weiber und\nGesang_. So say the poets in their verses: Wine, women, and song!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it were only that! Take all the poetry, the painting, the\nsculpture, beginning with Pouschkine\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Little Feet,\xe2\x80\x99 with \xe2\x80\x98Venus and\nPhryne,\xe2\x80\x99 and you will see that woman is only a means of enjoyment. That\nis what she is at Trouba,[*] at Gratchevka, and in a court ball-room.\nAnd think of this diabolical trick: if she were a thing without moral\nvalue, it might be said that woman is a fine morsel; but, in the first\nplace, these knights assure us that they adore woman (they adore her\nand look upon her, however, as a means of enjoyment), then all assure\nus that they esteem woman. Some give up their seats to her, pick up her\nhandkerchief; others recognize in her a right to fill all offices,\nparticipate in government, etc., but, in spite of all that, the\nessential point remains the same. She is, she remains, an object of\nsensual desire, and she knows it. It is slavery, for slavery is nothing\nelse than the utilization of the labor of some for the enjoyment of\nothers. That slavery may not exist people must refuse to enjoy the\nlabor of others, and look upon it as a shameful act and as a sin.\n\n[*] A suburb of Moscow.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cActually, this is what happens. They abolish the external form, they\nsuppress the formal sales of slaves, and then they imagine and assure\nothers that slavery is abolished. They are unwilling to see that it\nstill exists, since people, as before, like to profit by the labor of\nothers, and think it good and just. This being given, there will always\nbe found beings stronger or more cunning than others to profit thereby.\nThe same thing happens in the emancipation of woman. At bottom feminine\nservitude consists entirely in her assimilation with a means of\npleasure. They excite woman, they give her all sorts of rights equal to\nthose of men, but they continue to look upon her as an object of\nsensual desire, and thus they bring her up from infancy and in public\nopinion.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is always the humiliated and corrupt serf, and man remains always\nthe debauched Master. Yes, to abolish slavery, public opinion must\nadmit that it is shameful to exploit one\xe2\x80\x99s neighbor, and, to make woman\nfree, public opinion must admit that it is shameful to consider woman\nas an instrument of pleasure.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe emancipation of woman is not to be effected in the public courts\nor in the chamber of deputies, but in the sleeping chamber.\nProstitution is to be combated, not in the houses of ill-fame, but in\nthe family. They free woman in the public courts and in the chamber of\ndeputies, but she remains an instrument. Teach her, as she is taught\namong us, to look upon herself as such, and she will always remain an\ninferior being. Either, with the aid of the rascally doctors, she will\ntry to prevent conception, and descend, not to the level of an animal,\nbut to the level of a thing; or she will be what she is in the great\nmajority of cases,\xe2\x80\x94sick, hysterical, wretched, without hope of\nspiritual progress.\xe2\x80\x9d . . .\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why that?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! the most astonishing thing is that no one is willing to see this\nthing, evident as it is, which the doctors must understand, but which\nthey take good care not to do. Man does not wish to know the law of\nnature,\xe2\x80\x94children. But children are born and become an embarrassment.\nThen man devises means of avoiding this embarrassment. We have not yet\nreached the low level of Europe, nor Paris, nor the \xe2\x80\x98system of two\nchildren,\xe2\x80\x99 nor Mahomet. We have discovered nothing, because we have\ngiven it no thought. We feel that there is something bad in the two\nfirst means; but we wish to preserve the family, and our view of woman\nis still worse.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith us woman must be at the same time mistress and nurse, and her\nstrength is not sufficient. That is why we have hysteria, nervous\nattacks, and, among the peasants, witchcraft. Note that among the young\ngirls of the peasantry this state of things does not exist, but only\namong the wives, and the wives who live with their husbands. The reason\nis clear, and this is the cause of the intellectual and moral decline\nof woman, and of her abasement.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they would only reflect what a grand work for the wife is the\nperiod of gestation! In her is forming the being who continues us, and\nthis holy work is thwarted and rendered painful . . . by what? It is\nfrightful to think of it! And after that they talk of the liberties and\nthe rights of woman! It is like the cannibals fattening their prisoners\nin order to devour them, and assuring these unfortunates at the same\ntime that their rights and their liberties are guarded!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAll this was new to me, and astonished me very much.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if this is so,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cit follows that one may love his wife\nonly once every two years; and as man\xe2\x80\x9d . . .\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd as man has need of her, you are going to say. At least, so the\npriests of science assure us. I would force these priests to fulfil the\nfunction of these women, who, in their opinion, are necessary to man. I\nwonder what song they would sing then. Assure man that he needs brandy,\ntobacco, opium, and he will believe those poisons necessary. It follows\nthat God did not know how to arrange matters properly, since, without\nasking the opinions of the priests, he has combined things as they are.\nMan needs, so they have decided, to satisfy his sensual desire, and\nhere this function is disturbed by the birth and the nursing of\nchildren.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, then, is to be done? Why, apply to the priests; they will\narrange everything, and they have really discovered a way. When, then,\nwill these rascals with their lies be uncrowned! It is high time. We\nhave had enough of them. People go mad, and shoot each other with\nrevolvers, and always because of that! And how could it be otherwise?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne would say that the animals know that descent continues their race,\nand that they follow a certain law in regard thereto. Only man does not\nknow this, and is unwilling to know it. He cares only to have as much\nsensual enjoyment as possible. The king of nature,\xe2\x80\x94man! In the name of\nhis love he kills half the human race. Of woman, who ought to be his\naid in the movement of humanity toward liberty, he makes, in the name\nof his pleasures, not an aid, but an enemy. Who is it that everywhere\nputs a check upon the progressive movement of humanity? Woman. Why is\nit so?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the reason that I have given, and for that reason only.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, much worse than the animal is man when he does not live as a man.\nThus was I. The horrible part is that I believed, inasmuch as I did not\nallow myself to be seduced by other women that I was leading an honest\nfamily life, that I was a very moral being, and that if we had\nquarrels, the fault was in my wife, and in her character.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is evident that the fault was not in her. She was like\neverybody else, like the majority. She was brought up according to the\nprinciples exacted by the situation of our society,\xe2\x80\x94that is, as all the\nyoung girls of our wealthy classes, without exception, are brought up,\nand as they cannot fail to be brought up. How many times we hear or\nread of reflections upon the abnormal condition of women, and upon what\nthey ought to be. But these are only vain words. The education of women\nresults from the real and not imaginary view which the world entertains\nof women\xe2\x80\x99s vocation. According to this view, the condition of women\nconsists in procuring pleasure and it is to that end that her education\nis directed. From her infancy she is taught only those things that are\ncalculated to increase her charm. Every young girl is accustomed to\nthink only of that.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs the serfs were brought up solely to please their masters, so woman\nis brought up to attract men. It cannot be otherwise. But you will say,\nperhaps, that that applies only to young girls who are badly brought\nup, but that there is another education, an education that is serious,\nin the schools, an education in the dead languages, an education in the\ninstitutions of midwifery, an education in medical courses, and in\nother courses. It is false.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery sort of feminine education has for its sole object the\nattraction of men.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome attract by music or curly hair, others by science or by civic\nvirtue. The object is the same, and cannot be otherwise (since no other\nobject exists),\xe2\x80\x94to seduce man in order to possess him. Imagine courses\nof instruction for women and feminine science without men,\xe2\x80\x94that is,\nlearned women, and men not _knowing_ them as learned. Oh, no! No\neducation, no instruction can change woman as long as her highest ideal\nshall be marriage and not virginity, freedom from sensuality. Until\nthat time she will remain a serf. One need only imagine, forgetting the\nuniversality of the case, the conditions in which our young girls are\nbrought up, to avoid astonishment at the debauchery of the women of our\nupper classes. It is the opposite that would cause astonishment.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFollow my reasoning. From infancy garments, ornaments, cleanliness,\ngrace, dances, music, reading of poetry, novels, singing, the theatre,\nthe concert, for use within and without, according as women listen, or\npractice themselves. With that, complete physical idleness, an\nexcessive care of the body, a vast consumption of sweetmeats; and God\nknows how the poor maidens suffer from their own sensuality, excited by\nall these things. Nine out of ten are tortured intolerably during the\nfirst period of maturity, and afterward provided they do not marry at\nthe age of twenty. That is what we are unwilling to see, but those who\nhave eyes see it all the same. And even the majority of these\nunfortunate creatures are so excited by a hidden sensuality (and it is\nlucky if it is hidden) that they are fit for nothing. They become\nanimated only in the presence of men. Their whole life is spent in\npreparations for coquetry, or in coquetry itself. In the presence of\nmen they become too animated; they begin to live by sensual energy. But\nthe moment the man goes away, the life stops.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that, not in the presence of a certain man, but in the presence of\nany man, provided he is not utterly hideous. You will say that this is\nan exception. No, it is a rule. Only in some it is made very evident,\nin others less so. But no one lives by her own life; they are all\ndependent upon man. They cannot be otherwise, since to them the\nattraction of the greatest number of men is the ideal of life (young\ngirls and married women), and it is for this reason that they have no\nfeeling stronger than that of the animal need of every female who tries\nto attract the largest number of males in order to increase the\nopportunities for choice. So it is in the life of young girls, and so\nit continues during marriage. In the life of young girls it is\nnecessary in order to selection, and in marriage it is necessary in\norder to rule the husband. Only one thing suppresses or interrupts\nthese tendencies for a time,\xe2\x80\x94namely, children,\xe2\x80\x94and then only when the\nwoman is not a monster,\xe2\x80\x94that is, when she nurses her own children. Here\nagain the doctor interferes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith my wife, who desired to nurse her own children, and who did nurse\nsix of them, it happened that the first child was sickly. The doctors,\nwho cynically undressed her and felt of her everywhere, and whom I had\nto thank and pay for these acts,\xe2\x80\x94these dear doctors decided that she\nought not to nurse her child, and she was temporarily deprived of the\nonly remedy for coquetry. A nurse finished the nursing of this\nfirst-born,\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, we profited by the poverty and ignorance of\na woman to steal her from her own little one in favor of ours, and for\nthat purpose we dressed her in a _kakoschnik_ trimmed with gold lace.\nNevertheless, that is not the question; but there was again awakened in\nmy wife that coquetry which had been sleeping during the nursing\nperiod. Thanks to that, she reawakened in me the torments of jealousy\nwhich I had formerly known, though in a much slighter degree.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, jealousy, that is another of the secrets of marriage known to all\nand concealed by all. Besides the general cause of the mutual hatred of\nhusbands and wives resulting from complicity in the pollution of a\nhuman being, and also from other causes, the inexhaustible source of\nmarital wounds is jealousy. But by tacit consent it is determined to\nconceal them from all, and we conceal them. Knowing them, each one\nsupposes in himself that it is an unfortunate peculiarity, and not a\ncommon destiny. So it was with me, and it had to be so. There cannot\nfail to be jealousy between husbands and wives who live immorally. If\nthey cannot sacrifice their pleasures for the welfare of their child,\nthey conclude therefrom, and truly, that they will not sacrifice their\npleasures for, I will not say happiness and tranquillity (since one may\nsin in secret), but even for the sake of conscience. Each one knows\nvery well that neither admits any high moral reasons for not betraying\nthe other, since in their mutual relations they fail in the\nrequirements of morality, and from that time distrust and watch each\nother.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what a frightful feeling of jealousy! I do not speak of that real\njealousy which has foundations (it is tormenting, but it promises an\nissue), but of that unconscious jealousy which inevitably accompanies\nevery immoral marriage, and which, having no cause, has no end. This\njealousy is frightful. Frightful, that is the word.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this is it. A young man speaks to my wife. He looks at her with a\nsmile, and, as it seems to me, he surveys her body. How does he dare to\nthink of her, to think of the possibility of a romance with her? And\nhow can she, seeing this, tolerate him? Not only does she tolerate him,\nbut she seems pleased. I even see that she puts herself to trouble on\nhis account. And in my soul there rises such a hatred for her that each\nof her words, each gesture, disgusts me. She notices it, she knows not\nwhat to do, and how assume an air of indifferent animation? Ah! I\nsuffer! That makes her gay, she is content. And my hatred increases\ntenfold, but I do not dare to give it free force, because at the bottom\nof my soul I know that there are no real reasons for it, and I remain\nin my seat, feigning indifference, and exaggerating my attention and\ncourtesy to _him_.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I get angry with myself. I desire to leave the room, to leave\nthem alone, and I do, in fact, go out; but scarcely am I outside when I\nam invaded by a fear of what is taking place within my absence. I go in\nagain, inventing some pretext. Or sometimes I do not go in; I remain\nnear the door, and listen. How can she humiliate herself and humiliate\nme by placing me in this cowardly situation of suspicion and espionage?\nOh, abomination! Oh, the wicked animal! And he too, what does he think\nof you? But he is like all men. He is what I was before my marriage. It\ngives him pleasure. He even smiles when he looks at me, as much as to\nsay: \xe2\x80\x98What have you to do with this? It is my turn now.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis feeling is horrible. Its burn is unendurable. To entertain this\nfeeling toward any one, to once suspect a man of lusting after my wife,\nwas enough to spoil this man forever in my eyes, as if he had been\nsprinkled with vitriol. Let me once become jealous of a being, and\nnevermore could I re-establish with him simple human relations, and my\neyes flashed when I looked at him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for my wife, so many times had I enveloped her with this moral\nvitriol, with this jealous hatred, that she was degraded thereby. In\nthe periods of this causeless hatred I gradually uncrowned her. I\ncovered her with shame in my imagination.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI invented impossible knaveries. I suspected, I am ashamed to say,\nthat she, this queen of \xe2\x80\x98The Thousand and One Nights,\xe2\x80\x99 deceived me with\nmy serf, under my very eyes, and laughing at me.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus, with each new access of jealousy (I speak always of causeless\njealousy), I entered into the furrow dug formerly by my filthy\nsuspicions, and I continually deepened it. She did the same thing. If I\nhave reasons to be jealous, she who knew my past had a thousand times\nmore. And she was more ill-natured in her jealousy than I. And the\nsufferings that I felt from her jealousy were different, and likewise\nvery painful.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe situation may be described thus. We are living more or less\ntranquilly. I am even gay and contented. Suddenly we start a\nconversation on some most commonplace subject, and directly she finds\nherself disagreeing with me upon matters concerning which we have been\ngenerally in accord. And furthermore I see that, without any necessity\ntherefor, she is becoming irritated. I think that she has a nervous\nattack, or else that the subject of conversation is really disagreeable\nto her. We talk of something else, and that begins again. Again she\ntorments me, and becomes irritated. I am astonished and look for a\nreason. Why? For what? She keeps silence, answers me with\nmonosyllables, evidently making allusions to something. I begin to\ndivine that the reason of all this is that I have taken a few walks in\nthe garden with her cousin, to whom I did not give even a thought. I\nbegin to divine, but I cannot say so. If I say so, I confirm her\nsuspicions. I interrogate her, I question her. She does not answer, but\nshe sees that I understand, and that confirms her suspicions.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What is the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x99 I ask.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Nothing, I am as well as usual,\xe2\x80\x99 she answers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd at the same time, like a crazy woman, she gives utterance to the\nsilliest remarks, to the most inexplicable explosions of spite.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes I am patient, but at other times I break out with anger.\nThen her own irritation is launched forth in a flood of insults, in\ncharges of imaginary crimes and all carried to the highest degree by\nsobs, tears, and retreats through the house to the most improbable\nspots. I go to look for her. I am ashamed before people, before the\nchildren, but there is nothing to be done. She is in a condition where\nI feel that she is ready for anything. I run, and finally find her.\nNights of torture follow, in which both of us, with exhausted nerves,\nappease each other, after the most cruel words and accusations.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, jealousy, causeless jealousy, is the condition of our debauched\nconjugal life. And throughout my marriage never did I cease to feel it\nand to suffer from it. There were two periods in which I suffered most\nintensely. The first time was after the birth of our first child, when\nthe doctors had forbidden my wife to nurse it. I was particularly\njealous, in the first place, because my wife felt that restlessness\npeculiar to animal matter when the regular course of life is\ninterrupted without occasion. But especially was I jealous because,\nhaving seen with what facility she had thrown off her moral duties as a\nmother, I concluded rightly, though unconsciously, that she would throw\noff as easily her conjugal duties, feeling all the surer of this\nbecause she was in perfect health, as was shown by the fact that, in\nspite of the prohibition of the dear doctors, she nursed her following\nchildren, and even very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see that you have no love for the doctors,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, having noticed\nPosdnicheff\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinarily spiteful expression of face and tone of\nvoice whenever he spoke of them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not a question of loving them or of not loving them. They have\nruined my life, as they have ruined the lives of thousands of beings\nbefore me, and I cannot help connecting the consequence with the cause.\nI conceive that they desire, like the lawyers and the rest, to make\nmoney. I would willingly have given them half of my income\xe2\x80\x94and any one\nwould have done it in my place, understanding what they do\xe2\x80\x94if they had\nconsented not to meddle in my conjugal life, and to keep themselves at\na distance. I have compiled no statistics, but I know scores of\ncases\xe2\x80\x94in reality, they are innumerable\xe2\x80\x94where they have killed, now a\nchild in its mother\xe2\x80\x99s womb, asserting positively that the mother could\nnot give birth to it (when the mother could give birth to it very\nwell), now mothers, under the pretext of a so-called operation. No one\nhas counted these murders, just as no one counted the murders of the\nInquisition, because it was supposed that they were committed for the\nbenefit of humanity. Innumerable are the crimes of the doctors! But all\nthese crimes are nothing compared with the materialistic demoralization\nwhich they introduce into the world through women. I say nothing of the\nfact that, if it were to follow their advice,\xe2\x80\x94thanks to the microbe\nwhich they see everywhere,\xe2\x80\x94humanity, instead of tending to union, would\nproceed straight to complete disunion. Everybody, according to their\ndoctrine, should isolate himself, and never remove from his mouth a\nsyringe filled with phenic acid (moreover, they have found out now that\nit does no good). But I would pass over all these things. The supreme\npoison is the perversion of people, especially of women. One can no\nlonger say now: \xe2\x80\x98You live badly, live better.\xe2\x80\x99 One can no longer say it\neither to himself or to others, for, if you live badly (say the\ndoctors), the cause is in the nervous system or in something similar,\nand it is necessary to go to consult them, and they will prescribe for\nyou thirty-five copecks\xe2\x80\x99 worth of remedies to be bought at the\ndrug-store, and you must swallow them. Your condition grows worse?\nAgain to the doctors, and more remedies! An excellent business!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut to return to our subject. I was saying that my wife nursed her\nchildren well, that the nursing and the gestation of the children, and\nthe children in general, quieted my tortures of jealousy, but that, on\nthe other hand, they provoked torments of a different sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe children came rapidly, one after another, and there happened what\nhappens in our society with children and doctors. Yes, children,\nmaternal love, it is a painful thing. Children, to a woman of our\nsociety, are not a joy, a pride, nor a fulfilment of her vocation, but\na cause of fear, anxiety, and interminable suffering, torture. Women\nsay it, they think it, and they feel it too. Children to them are\nreally a torture, not because they do not wish to give birth to them,\nnurse them, and care for them (women with a strong maternal\ninstinct\xe2\x80\x94and such was my wife\xe2\x80\x94are ready to do that), but because the\nchildren may fall sick and die. They do not wish to give birth to them,\nand then not love them; and when they love, they do not wish to feel\nfear for the child\xe2\x80\x99s health and life. That is why they do not wish to\nnurse them. \xe2\x80\x98If I nurse it,\xe2\x80\x99 they say, \xe2\x80\x98I shall become too fond of it.\xe2\x80\x99\nOne would think that they preferred india-rubber children, which could\nneither be sick nor die, and could always be repaired. What an\nentanglement in the brains of these poor women! Why such abominations\nto avoid pregnancy, and to avoid the love of the little ones?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove, the most joyous condition of the soul, is represented as a\ndanger. And why? Because, when a man does not live as a man, he is\nworse than a beast. A woman cannot look upon a child otherwise than as\na pleasure. It is true that it is painful to give birth to it, but what\nlittle hands! . . . Oh, the little hands! Oh, the little feet! Oh, its\nsmile! Oh, its little body! Oh, its prattle! Oh, its hiccough! In a\nword, it is a feeling of animal, sensual maternity. But as for any idea\nas to the mysterious significance of the appearance of a new human\nbeing to replace us, there is scarcely a sign of it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing of it appears in all that is said and done. No one has any\nfaith now in a baptism of the child, and yet that was nothing but a\nreminder of the human significance of the newborn babe.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have rejected all that, but they have not replaced it, and there\nremain only the dresses, the laces, the little hands, the little feet,\nand whatever exists in the animal. But the animal has neither\nimagination, nor foresight, nor reason, nor a doctor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! not even a doctor! The chicken droops its head, overwhelmed, or\nthe calf dies; the hen clucks and the cow lows for a time, and then\nthese beasts continue to live, forgetting what has happened.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith us, if the child falls sick, what is to be done, how to care for\nit, what doctor to call, where to go? If it dies, there will be no more\nlittle hands or little feet, and then what is the use of the sufferings\nendured? The cow does not ask all that, and this is why children are a\nsource of misery. The cow has no imagination, and for that reason\ncannot think how it might have saved the child if it had done this or\nthat, and its grief, founded in its physical being, lasts but a very\nshort time. It is only a condition, and not that sorrow which becomes\nexaggerated to the point of despair, thanks to idleness and satiety.\nThe cow has not that reasoning faculty which would enable it to ask the\nwhy. Why endure all these tortures? What was the use of so much love,\nif the little ones were to die? The cow has no logic which tells it to\nhave no more children, and, if any come accidentally, to neither love\nnor nurse them, that it may not suffer. But our wives reason, and\nreason in this way, and that is why I said that, when a man does not\nlive as a man, he is beneath the animal.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut then, how is it necessary to act, in your opinion, in order to\ntreat children humanly?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow? Why, love them humanly.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, do not mothers love their children?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey do not love them humanly, or very seldom do, and that is why they\ndo not love them even as dogs. Mark this, a hen, a goose, a wolf, will\nalways remain to woman inaccessible ideals of animal love. It is a rare\nthing for a woman to throw herself, at the peril of her life, upon an\nelephant to snatch her child away, whereas a hen or a sparrow will not\nfail to fly at a dog and sacrifice itself utterly for its children.\nObserve this, also. Woman has the power to limit her physical love for\nher children, which an animal cannot do. Does that mean that, because\nof this, woman is inferior to the animal? No. She is superior (and even\nto say superior is unjust, she is not superior, she is different), but\nshe has other duties, human duties. She can restrain herself in the\nmatter of animal love, and transfer her love to the soul of the child.\nThat is what woman\xe2\x80\x99s _r\xc3\xb4le_ should be, and that is precisely what we do\nnot see in our society. We read of the heroic acts of mothers who\nsacrifice their children in the name of a superior idea, and these\nthings seem to us like tales of the ancient world, which do not concern\nus. And yet I believe that, if the mother has not some ideal, in the\nname of which she can sacrifice the animal feeling, and if this force\nfinds no employment, she will transfer it to chimerical attempts to\nphysically preserve her child, aided in this task by the doctor, and\nshe will suffer as she does suffer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it was with my wife. Whether there was one child or five, the\nfeeling remained the same. In fact, it was a little better when there\nhad been five. Life was always poisoned with fear for the children, not\nonly from their real or imaginary diseases, but even by their simple\npresence. For my part, at least, throughout my conjugal life, all my\ninterests and all my happiness depended upon the health of my children,\ntheir condition, their studies. Children, it is needless to say, are a\nserious consideration; but all ought to live, and in our days parents\ncan no longer live. Regular life does not exist for them. The whole\nlife of the family hangs by a hair. What a terrible thing it is to\nsuddenly receive the news that little Basile is vomiting, or that Lise\nhas a cramp in the stomach! Immediately you abandon everything, you\nforget everything, everything becomes nothing. The essential thing is\nthe doctor, the enema, the temperature. You cannot begin a conversation\nbut little Pierre comes running in with an anxious air to ask if he may\neat an apple, or what jacket he shall put on, or else it is the servant\nwho enters with a screaming baby.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRegular, steady family life does not exist. Where you live, and\nconsequently what you do, depends upon the health of the little ones,\nthe health of the little ones depends upon nobody, and, thanks to the\ndoctors, who pretend to aid health, your entire life is disturbed. It\nis a perpetual peril. Scarcely do we believe ourselves out of it when a\nnew danger comes: more attempts to save. Always the situation of\nsailors on a foundering vessel. Sometimes it seemed to me that this was\ndone on purpose, that my wife feigned anxiety in order to conquer me,\nsince that solved the question so simply for her benefit. It seemed to\nme that all that she did at those times was done for its effect upon\nme, but now I see that she herself, my wife, suffered and was tortured\non account of the little ones, their health, and their diseases.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA torture to both of us, but to her the children were also a means of\nforgetting herself, like an intoxication. I often noticed, when she was\nvery sad, that she was relieved, when a child fell sick, at being able\nto take refuge in this intoxication. It was involuntary intoxication,\nbecause as yet there was nothing else. On every side we heard that Mrs.\nSo-and-so had lost children, that Dr. So-and-so had saved the child of\nMrs. So-and-so, and that in a certain family all had moved from the\nhouse in which they were living, and thereby saved the little ones. And\nthe doctors, with a serious air, confirmed this, sustaining my wife in\nher opinions. She was not prone to fear, but the doctor dropped some\nword, like corruption of the blood, scarlatina, or else\xe2\x80\x94heaven help\nus\xe2\x80\x94diphtheria, and off she went.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was impossible for it to be otherwise. Women in the old days had\nthe belief that \xe2\x80\x98God has given, God has taken away,\xe2\x80\x99 that the soul of\nthe little angel is going to heaven, and that it is better to die\ninnocent than to die in sin. If the women of to-day had something like\nthis faith, they could endure more peacefully the sickness of their\nchildren. But of all that there does not remain even a trace. And yet\nit is necessary to believe in something; consequently they stupidly\nbelieve in medicine, and not even in medicine, but in the doctor. One\nbelieves in X, another in Z, and, like all believers, they do not see\nthe idiocy of their beliefs. They believe _quia absurdum_, because, in\nreality, if they did not believe in a stupid way, they would see the\nvanity of all that these brigands prescribe for them. Scarlatina is a\ncontagious disease; so, when one lives in a large city, half the family\nhas to move away from its residence (we did it twice), and yet every\nman in the city is a centre through which pass innumerable diameters,\ncarrying threads of all sorts of contagions. There is no obstacle: the\nbaker, the tailor, the coachman, the laundresses.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I would undertake, for every man who moves on account of\ncontagion, to find in his new dwelling-place another contagion similar,\nif not the same.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that is not all. Every one knows rich people who, after a case of\ndiphtheria, destroy everything in their residences, and then fall sick\nin houses newly built and furnished. Every one knows, likewise, numbers\nof men who come in contact with sick people and do not get infected.\nOur anxieties are due to the people who circulate tall stories. One\nwoman says that she has an excellent doctor. \xe2\x80\x98Pardon me,\xe2\x80\x99 answers the\nother, \xe2\x80\x98he killed such a one,\xe2\x80\x99 or such a one. And _vice versa_. Bring\nher another, who knows no more, who learned from the same books, who\ntreats according to the same formulas, but who goes about in a\ncarriage, and asks a hundred roubles a visit, and she will have faith\nin him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt all lies in the fact that our women are savages. They have no\nbelief in God, but some of them believe in the evil eye, and the others\nin doctors who charge high fees. If they had faith they would know that\nscarlatina, diphtheria, etc., are not so terrible, since they cannot\ndisturb that which man can and should love,\xe2\x80\x94the soul. There can result\nfrom them only that which none of us can avoid,\xe2\x80\x94disease and death.\nWithout faith in God, they love only physically, and all their energy\nis concentrated upon the preservation of life, which cannot be\npreserved, and which the doctors promise the fools of both sexes to\nsave. And from that time there is nothing to be done; the doctors must\nbe summoned.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus the presence of the children not only did not improve our\nrelations as husband and wife, but, on the contrary, disunited us. The\nchildren became an additional cause of dispute, and the larger they\ngrew, the more they became an instrument of struggle.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne would have said that we used them as weapons with which to combat\neach other. Each of us had his favorite. I made use of little Basile\n(the eldest), she of Lise. Further, when the children reached an age\nwhere their characters began to be defined, they became allies, which\nwe drew each in his or her own direction. They suffered horribly from\nthis, the poor things, but we, in our perpetual hubbub, were not\nclear-headed enough to think of them. The little girl was devoted to\nme, but the eldest boy, who resembled my wife, his favorite, often\ninspired me with dislike.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe lived at first in the country, then in the city, and, if the final\nmisfortune had not happened, I should have lived thus until my old age\nand should then have believed that I had had a good life,\xe2\x80\x94not too good,\nbut, on the other hand, not bad,\xe2\x80\x94an existence such as other people\nlead. I should not have understood the abyss of misfortune and ignoble\nfalsehood in which I floundered about, feeling that something was not\nright. I felt, in the first place, that I, a man, who, according to my\nideas, ought to be the master, wore the petticoats, and that I could\nnot get rid of them. The principal cause of my subjection was the\nchildren. I should have liked to free myself, but I could not. Bringing\nup the children, and resting upon them, my wife ruled. I did not then\nrealize that she could not help ruling, especially because, in\nmarrying, she was morally superior to me, as every young girl is\nincomparably superior to the man, since she is incomparably purer.\nStrange thing! The ordinary wife in our society is a very commonplace\nperson or worse, selfish, gossiping, whimsical, whereas the ordinary\nyoung girl, until the age of twenty, is a charming being, ready for\neverything that is beautiful and lofty. Why is this so? Evidently\nbecause husbands pervert them, and lower them to their own level.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn truth, if boys and girls are born equal, the little girls find\nthemselves in a better situation. In the first place, the young girl is\nnot subjected to the perverting conditions to which we are subjected.\nShe has neither cigarettes, nor wine, nor cards, nor comrades, nor\npublic houses, nor public functions. And then the chief thing is that\nshe is physically pure, and that is why, in marrying, she is superior\nto her husband. She is superior to man as a young girl, and when she\nbecomes a wife in our society, where there is no need to work in order\nto live, she becomes superior, also, by the gravity of the acts of\ngeneration, birth, and nursing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWoman, in bringing a child into the world, and giving it her bosom,\nsees clearly that her affair is more serious than the affair of man,\nwho sits in the Zemstvo, in the court. She knows that in these\nfunctions the main thing is money, and money can be made in different\nways, and for that very reason money is not inevitably necessary, like\nnursing a child. Consequently woman is necessarily superior to man, and\nmust rule. But man, in our society, not only does not recognize this,\nbut, on the contrary, always looks upon her from the height of his\ngrandeur, despising what she does.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus my wife despised me for my work at the Zemstvo, because she gave\nbirth to children and nursed them. I, in turn, thought that woman\xe2\x80\x99s\nlabor was most contemptible, which one might and should laugh at.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cApart from the other motives, we were also separated by a mutual\ncontempt. Our relations grew ever more hostile, and we arrived at that\nperiod when, not only did dissent provoke hostility, but hostility\nprovoked dissent. Whatever she might say, I was sure in advance to hold\na contrary opinion; and she the same. Toward the fourth year of our\nmarriage it was tacitly decided between us that no intellectual\ncommunity was possible, and we made no further attempts at it. As to\nthe simplest objects, we each held obstinately to our own opinions.\nWith strangers we talked upon the most varied and most intimate\nmatters, but not with each other. Sometimes, in listening to my wife\ntalk with others in my presence, I said to myself: \xe2\x80\x98What a woman!\nEverything that she says is a lie!\xe2\x80\x99 And I was astonished that the\nperson with whom she was conversing did not see that she was lying.\nWhen we were together; we were condemned to silence, or to\nconversations which, I am sure, might have been carried on by animals.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What time is it? It is bed-time. What is there for dinner to-day?\nWhere shall we go? What is there in the newspaper? The doctor must be\nsent for, Lise has a sore throat.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnless we kept within the extremely narrow limits of such\nconversation, irritation was sure to ensue. The presence of a third\nperson relieved us, for through an intermediary we could still\ncommunicate. She probably believed that she was always right. As for\nme, in my own eyes, I was a saint beside her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe periods of what we call love arrived as often as formerly. They\nwere more brutal, without refinement, without ornament; but they were\nshort, and generally followed by periods of irritation without cause,\nirritation fed by the most trivial pretexts. We had spats about the\ncoffee, the table-cloth, the carriage, games of cards,\xe2\x80\x94trifles, in\nshort, which could not be of the least importance to either of us. As\nfor me, a terrible execration was continually boiling up within me. I\nwatched her pour the tea, swing her foot, lift her spoon to her mouth,\nand blow upon hot liquids or sip them, and I detested her as if these\nhad been so many crimes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not notice that these periods of irritation depended very\nregularly upon the periods of love. Each of the latter was followed by\none of the former. A period of intense love was followed by a long\nperiod of anger; a period of mild love induced a mild irritation. We\ndid not understand that this love and this hatred were two opposite\nfaces of the same animal feeling. To live thus would be terrible, if\none understood the philosophy of it. But we did not perceive this, we\ndid not analyze it. It is at once the torture and the relief of man\nthat, when he lives irregularly, he can cherish illusions as to the\nmiseries of his situation. So did we. She tried to forget herself in\nsudden and absorbing occupations, in household duties, the care of the\nfurniture, her dress and that of her children, in the education of the\nlatter, and in looking after their health. These were occupations that\ndid not arise from any immediate necessity, but she accomplished them\nas if her life and that of her children depended on whether the pastry\nwas allowed to burn, whether a curtain was hanging properly, whether a\ndress was a success, whether a lesson was well learned, or whether a\nmedicine was swallowed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw clearly that to her all this was, more than anything else, a\nmeans of forgetting, an intoxication, just as hunting, card-playing,\nand my functions at the Zemstvo served the same purpose for me. It is\ntrue that in addition I had an intoxication literally\nspeaking,\xe2\x80\x94tobacco, which I smoked in large quantities, and wine, upon\nwhich I did not get drunk, but of which I took too much. Vodka before\nmeals, and during meals two glasses of wine, so that a perpetual mist\nconcealed the turmoil of existence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese new theories of hypnotism, of mental maladies, of hysteria are\nnot simple stupidities, but dangerous or evil stupidities. Charcot, I\nam sure, would have said that my wife was hysterical, and of me he\nwould have said that I was an abnormal being, and he would have wanted\nto treat me. But in us there was nothing requiring treatment. All this\nmental malady was the simple result of the fact that we were living\nimmorally. Thanks to this immoral life, we suffered, and, to stifle our\nsufferings, we tried abnormal means, which the doctors call the\n\xe2\x80\x98symptoms\xe2\x80\x99 of a mental malady,\xe2\x80\x94_hysteria_.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was no occasion in all this to apply for treatment to Charcot or\nto anybody else. Neither suggestion nor bromide would have been\neffective in working our cure. The needful thing was an examination of\nthe origin of the evil. It is as when one is sitting on a nail; if you\nsee the nail, you see that which is irregular in your life, and you\navoid it. Then the pain stops, without any necessity of stifling it.\nOur pain arose from the irregularity of our life, and also my jealousy,\nmy irritability, and the necessity of keeping myself in a state of\nperpetual semi-intoxication by hunting, card-playing, and, above all,\nthe use of wine and tobacco. It was because of this irregularity that\nmy wife so passionately pursued her occupations. The sudden changes of\nher disposition, from extreme sadness to extreme gayety, and her\nbabble, arose from the need of forgetting herself, of forgetting her\nlife, in the continual intoxication of varied and very brief\noccupations.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus we lived in a perpetual fog, in which we did not distinguish our\ncondition. We were like two galley-slaves fastened to the same ball,\ncursing each other, poisoning each other\xe2\x80\x99s existence, and trying to\nshake each other off. I was still unaware that ninety-nine families out\nof every hundred live in the same hell, and that it cannot be\notherwise. I had not learned this fact from others or from myself. The\ncoincidences that are met in regular, and even in irregular life, are\nsurprising. At the very period when the life of parents becomes\nimpossible, it becomes indispensable that they go to the city to live,\nin order to educate their children. That is what we did.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPosdnicheff became silent, and twice there escaped him, in the\nhalf-darkness, sighs, which at that moment seemed to me like suppressed\nsobs. Then he continued.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo we lived in the city. In the city the wretched feel less sad. One\ncan live there a hundred years without being noticed, and be dead a\nlong time before anybody will notice it. People have no time to inquire\ninto your life. All are absorbed. Business, social relations, art, the\nhealth of children, their education. And there are visits that must be\nreceived and made; it is necessary to see this one, it is necessary to\nhear that one or the other one. In the city there are always one, two,\nor three celebrities that it is indispensable that one should visit.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow one must care for himself, or care for such or such a little one,\nnow it is the professor, the private tutor, the governesses, . . . and\nlife is absolutely empty. In this activity we were less conscious of\nthe sufferings of our cohabitation. Moreover, in the first of it, we\nhad a superb occupation,\xe2\x80\x94the arrangement of the new dwelling, and then,\ntoo, the moving from the city to the country, and from the country to\nthe city.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus we spent a winter. The following winter an incident happened to\nus which passed unnoticed, but which was the fundamental cause of all\nthat happened later. My wife was suffering, and the rascals (the\ndoctors) would not permit her to conceive a child, and taught her how\nto avoid it. I was profoundly disgusted. I struggled vainly against it,\nbut she insisted frivolously and obstinately, and I surrendered. The\nlast justification of our life as wretches was thereby suppressed, and\nlife became baser than ever.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe peasant and the workingman need children, and hence their conjugal\nrelations have a justification. But we, when we have a few children,\nhave no need of any more. They make a superfluous confusion of expenses\nand joint heirs, and are an embarrassment. Consequently we have no\nexcuses for our existence as wretches, but we are so deeply degraded\nthat we do not see the necessity of a justification. The majority of\npeople in contemporary society give themselves up to this debauchery\nwithout the slightest remorse. We have no conscience left, except, so\nto speak, the conscience of public opinion and of the criminal code.\nBut in this matter neither of these consciences is struck. There is not\na being in society who blushes at it. Each one practices it,\xe2\x80\x94X, Y, Z,\netc. What is the use of multiplying beggars, and depriving ourselves of\nthe joys of social life? There is no necessity of having conscience\nbefore the criminal code, or of fearing it: low girls, soldiers\xe2\x80\x99 wives\nwho throw their children into ponds or wells, these certainly must be\nput in prison. But with us the suppression is effected opportunely and\nproperly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus we passed two years more. The method prescribed by the rascals\nhad evidently succeeded. My wife had grown stouter and handsomer. It\nwas the beauty of the end of summer. She felt it, and paid much\nattention to her person. She had acquired that provoking beauty that\nstirs men. She was in all the brilliancy of the wife of thirty years,\nwho conceives no children, eats heartily, and is excited. The very\nsight of her was enough to frighten one. She was like a spirited\ncarriage-horse that has long been idle, and suddenly finds itself\nwithout a bridle. As for my wife, she had no bridle, as for that\nmatter, ninety-nine hundredths of our women have none.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\n\nPosdnicheff\xe2\x80\x99s face had become transformed; his eyes were pitiable;\ntheir expression seemed strange, like that of another being than\nhimself; his moustache and beard turned up toward the top of his face;\nhis nose was diminished, and his mouth enlarged, immense, frightful.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed \xe2\x80\x9cshe had grown stouter since ceasing to conceive, and\nher anxieties about her children began to disappear. Not even to\ndisappear. One would have said that she was waking from a long\nintoxication, that on coming to herself she had perceived the entire\nuniverse with its joys, a whole world in which she had not learned to\nlive, and which she did not understand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98If only this world shall not vanish! When time is past, when old age\ncomes, one cannot recover it.\xe2\x80\x99 Thus, I believe, she thought, or rather\nfelt. Moreover, she could neither think nor feel otherwise. She had\nbeen brought up in this idea that there is in the world but one thing\nworthy of attention,\xe2\x80\x94love. In marrying, she had known something of this\nlove, but very far from everything that she had understood as promised\nher, everything that she expected. How many disillusions! How much\nsuffering! And an unexpected torture,\xe2\x80\x94the children! This torture had\ntold upon her, and then, thanks to the obliging doctor, she had learned\nthat it is possible to avoid having children. That had made her glad.\nShe had tried, and she was now revived for the only thing that she\nknew,\xe2\x80\x94for love. But love with a husband polluted by jealousy and\nill-nature was no longer her ideal. She began to think of some other\ntenderness; at least, that is what I thought. She looked about her as\nif expecting some event or some being. I noticed it, and I could not\nhelp being anxious.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways, now, it happened that, in talking with me through a third\nparty (that is, in talking with others, but with the intention that I\nshould hear), she boldly expressed,\xe2\x80\x94not thinking that an hour before\nshe had said the opposite,\xe2\x80\x94half joking, half seriously, this idea that\nmaternal anxieties are a delusion; that it is not worth while to\nsacrifice one\xe2\x80\x99s life to children. When one is young, it is necessary to\nenjoy life. So she occupied herself less with the children, not with\nthe same intensity as formerly, and paid more and more attention to\nherself, to her face,\xe2\x80\x94although she concealed it,\xe2\x80\x94to her pleasures, and\neven to her perfection from the worldly point of view. She began to\ndevote herself passionately to the piano, which had formerly stood\nforgotten in the corner. There, at the piano, began the adventure.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe _man_ appeared.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPosdnicheff seemed embarrassed, and twice again there escaped him that\nnasal sound of which I spoke above. I thought that it gave him pain to\nrefer to the _man_, and to remember him. He made an effort, as if to\nbreak down the obstacle that embarrassed him, and continued with\ndetermination.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was a bad man in my eyes, and not because he has played such an\nimportant _r\xc3\xb4le_ in my life, but because he was really such. For the\nrest, from the fact that he was bad, we must conclude that he was\nirresponsible. He was a musician, a violinist. Not a professional\nmusician, but half man of the world, half artist. His father, a country\nproprietor, was a neighbor of my father\xe2\x80\x99s. The father had become\nruined, and the children, three boys, were all sent away. Our man, the\nyoungest, was sent to his godmother at Paris. There they placed him in\nthe Conservatory, for he showed a taste for music. He came out a\nviolinist, and played in concerts.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOn the point of speaking evil of the other, Posdnicheff checked\nhimself, stopped, and said suddenly:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn truth, I know not how he lived. I only know that that year he came\nto Russia, and came to see me. Moist eyes of almond shape, smiling red\nlips, a little moustache well waxed, hair brushed in the latest\nfashion, a vulgarly pretty face,\xe2\x80\x94what the women call \xe2\x80\x98not bad,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94feebly\nbuilt physically, but with no deformity; with hips as broad as a\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s; correct, and insinuating himself into the familiarity of\npeople as far as possible, but having that keen sense that quickly\ndetects a false step and retires in reason,\xe2\x80\x94a man, in short, observant\nof the external rules of dignity, with that special Parisianism that is\nrevealed in buttoned boots, a gaudy cravat, and that something which\nforeigners pick up in Paris, and which, in its peculiarity and novelty,\nalways has an influence on our women. In his manners an external and\nartificial gayety, a way, you know, of referring to everything by\nhints, by unfinished fragments, as if everything that one says you knew\nalready, recalled it, and could supply the omissions. Well, he, with\nhis music, was the cause of all.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the trial the affair was so represented that everything seemed\nattributable to jealousy. It is false,\xe2\x80\x94that is, not quite false, but\nthere was something else. The verdict was rendered that I was a\ndeceived husband, that I had killed in defence of my sullied honor\n(that is the way they put it in their language), and thus I was\nacquitted. I tried to explain the affair from my own point of view, but\nthey concluded that I simply wanted to rehabilitate the memory of my\nwife. Her relations with the musician, whatever they may have been, are\nnow of no importance to me or to her. The important part is what I have\ntold you. The whole tragedy was due to the fact that this man came into\nour house at a time when an immense abyss had already been dug between\nus, that frightful tension of mutual hatred, in which the slightest\nmotive sufficed to precipitate the crisis. Our quarrels in the last\ndays were something terrible, and the more astonishing because they\nwere followed by a brutal passion extremely strained. If it had not\nbeen he, some other would have come. If the pretext had not been\njealousy, I should have discovered another. I insist upon this\npoint,\xe2\x80\x94that all husbands who live the married life that I lived must\neither resort to outside debauchery, or separate from their wives, or\nkill themselves, or kill their wives as I did. If there is any one in\nmy case to whom this does not happen, he is a very rare exception, for,\nbefore ending as I ended, I was several times on the point of suicide,\nand my wife made several attempts to poison herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn order that you may understand me, I must tell you how this\nhappened. We were living along, and all seemed well. Suddenly we began\nto talk of the children\xe2\x80\x99s education. I do not remember what words\neither of us uttered, but a discussion began, reproaches, leaps from\none subject to another. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, I know it. It has been so for a long\ntime.\xe2\x80\x99 . . . \xe2\x80\x98You said that.\xe2\x80\x99 . . . \xe2\x80\x98No, I did not say that.\xe2\x80\x99 . . .\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I lie?\xe2\x80\x99 etc.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I felt that the frightful crisis was approaching when I should\ndesire to kill her or else myself. I knew that it was approaching; I\nwas afraid of it as of fire; I wanted to restrain myself. But rage took\npossession of my whole being. My wife found herself in the same\ncondition, perhaps worse. She knew that she intentionally distorted\neach of my words, and each of her words was saturated with venom. All\nthat was dear to me she disparaged and profaned. The farther the\nquarrel went, the more furious it became. I cried, \xe2\x80\x98Be silent,\xe2\x80\x99 or\nsomething like that.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe bounded out of the room and ran toward the children. I tried to\nhold her back to finish my insults. I grasped her by the arm, and hurt\nher. She cried: \xe2\x80\x98Children, your father is beating me.\xe2\x80\x99 I cried: \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t\nlie.\xe2\x80\x99 She continued to utter falsehoods for the simple purpose of\nirritating me further. \xe2\x80\x98Ah, it is not the first time,\xe2\x80\x99 or something of\nthat sort. The children rushed toward her and tried to quiet her. I\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t sham.\xe2\x80\x99 She said: \xe2\x80\x98You look upon everything as a sham. You\nwould kill a person and say he was shamming. Now I understand you. That\nis what you want to do.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Oh, if you were only dead!\xe2\x80\x99 I cried.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember how that terrible phrase frightened me. Never had I thought\nthat I could utter words so brutal, so frightful, and I was stupefied\nat what had just escaped my lips. I fled into my private apartment. I\nsat down and began to smoke. I heard her go into the hall and prepare\nto go out. I asked her: \xe2\x80\x98Where are you going? She did not answer.\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, may the devil take you!\xe2\x80\x99 said I to myself, going back into my\nprivate room, where I lay down again and began smoking afresh.\nThousands of plans of vengeance, of ways of getting rid of her, and how\nto arrange this, and act as if nothing had happened,\xe2\x80\x94all this passed\nthrough my head. I thought of these things, and I smoked, and smoked,\nand smoked. I thought of running away, of making my escape, of going to\nAmerica. I went so far as to dream how beautiful it would be, after\ngetting rid of her, to love another woman, entirely different from her.\nI should be rid of her if she should die or if I should get a divorce,\nand I tried to think how that could be managed. I saw that I was\ngetting confused, but, in order not to see that I was not thinking\nrightly, I kept on smoking.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the life of the house went on as usual. The children\xe2\x80\x99s teacher\ncame and asked: \xe2\x80\x98Where is Madame? When will she return?\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe servants asked if they should serve the tea. I entered the\ndining-room. The children, Lise, the eldest girl, looked at me with\nfright, as if to question me, and she did not come. The whole evening\npassed, and still she did not come. Two sentiments kept succeeding each\nother in my soul,\xe2\x80\x94hatred of her, since she tortured myself and the\nchildren by her absence, but would finally return just the same, and\nfear lest she might return and make some attempt upon herself. But\nwhere should I look for her? At her sister\xe2\x80\x99s? It seemed so stupid to go\nto ask where one\xe2\x80\x99s wife is. Moreover, may God forbid, I hoped, that she\nshould be at her sister\xe2\x80\x99s! If she wishes to torment any one, let her\ntorment herself first. And suppose she were not at her sister\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose she were to do, or had already done, something.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, midnight, one o\xe2\x80\x99clock. . . . I did not sleep. I did\nnot go to my chamber. It is stupid to lie stretched out all alone, and\nto wait. But in my study I did not rest. I tried to busy myself, to\nwrite letters, to read. Impossible! I was alone, tortured, wicked, and\nI listened. Toward daylight I went to sleep. I awoke. She had not\nreturned. Everything in the house went on as usual, and all looked at\nme in astonishment, questioningly. The children\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were full of\nreproach for me.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd always the same feeling of anxiety about her, and of hatred\nbecause of this anxiety.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cToward eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning came her sister, her\nambassadress. Then began the usual phrases: \xe2\x80\x98She is in a terrible\nstate. What is the matter?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Why, nothing has happened.\xe2\x80\x99 I spoke of her\nasperity of character, and I added that I had done nothing, and that I\nwould not take the first step. If she wants a divorce, so much the\nbetter! My sister-in-law would not listen to this idea, and went away\nwithout having gained anything. I was obstinate, and I said boldly and\ndeterminedly, in talking to her, that I would not take the first step.\nImmediately she had gone I went into the other room, and saw the\nchildren in a frightened and pitiful state, and there I found myself\nalready inclined to take this first step. But I was bound by my word.\nAgain I walked up and down, always smoking. At breakfast I drank brandy\nand wine, and I reached the point which I unconsciously desired, the\npoint where I no longer saw the stupidity and baseness of my situation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cToward three o\xe2\x80\x99clock she came. I thought that she was appeased, or\nadmitted her defeat. I began to tell her that I was provoked by her\nreproaches. She answered me, with the same severe and terribly downcast\nface, that she had not come for explanations, but to take the children,\nthat we could not live together. I answered that it was not my fault,\nthat she had put me beside myself. She looked at me with a severe and\nsolemn air, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Say no more. You will repent it.\xe2\x80\x99 I said that I\ncould not tolerate comedies. Then she cried out something that I did\nnot understand, and rushed toward her room. The key turned in the lock,\nand she shut herself up. I pushed at the door. There was no response.\nFurious, I went away.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA half hour later Lise came running all in tears. \xe2\x80\x98What! Has anything\nhappened? We cannot hear Mamma!\xe2\x80\x99 We went toward my wife\xe2\x80\x99s room. I\npushed the door with all my might. The bolt was scarcely drawn, and the\ndoor opened. In a skirt, with high boots, my wife lay awkwardly on the\nbed. On the table an empty opium phial. We restored her to life. Tears\nand then reconciliation! Not reconciliation; internally each kept the\nhatred for the other, but it was absolutely necessary for the moment to\nend the scene in some way, and life began again as before. These\nscenes, and even worse, came now once a week, now every month, now\nevery day. And invariably the same incidents. Once I was absolutely\nresolved to fly, but through some inconceivable weakness I remained.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch were the circumstances in which we were living when the _man_\ncame. The man was bad, it is true. But what! No worse than we were.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we moved to Moscow, this gentleman\xe2\x80\x94his name was\nTroukhatchevsky\xe2\x80\x94came to my house. It was in the morning. I received\nhim. In former times we had been very familiar. He tried, by various\nadvances, to re-establish the familiarity, but I was determined to keep\nhim at a distance, and soon he gave it up. He displeased me extremely.\nAt the first glance I saw that he was a filthy _d\xc3\xa9bauch\xc3\xa9_. I was\njealous of him, even before he had seen my wife. But, strange thing!\nsome occult fatal power kept me from repulsing him and sending him\naway, and, on the contrary, induced me to suffer this approach. What\ncould have been simpler than to talk with him a few minutes, and then\ndismiss him coldly without introducing him to my wife? But no, as if on\npurpose, I turned the conversation upon his skill as a violinist, and\nhe answered that, contrary to what I had heard, he now played the\nviolin more than formerly. He remembered that I used to play. I\nanswered that I had abandoned music, but that my wife played very well.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSingular thing! Why, in the important events of our life, in those in\nwhich a man\xe2\x80\x99s fate is decided,\xe2\x80\x94as mine was decided in that moment,\xe2\x80\x94why\nin these events is there neither a past nor a future? My relations with\nTroukhatchevsky the first day, at the first hour, were such as they\nmight still have been after all that has happened. I was conscious that\nsome frightful misfortune must result from the presence of this man,\nand, in spite of that, I could not help being amiable to him. I\nintroduced him to my wife. She was pleased with him. In the beginning,\nI suppose, because of the pleasure of the violin playing, which she\nadored. She had even hired for that purpose a violinist from the\ntheatre. But when she cast a glance at me, she understood my feelings,\nand concealed her impression. Then began the mutual trickery and\ndeceit. I smiled agreeably, pretending that all this pleased me\nextremely. He, looking at my wife, as all _d\xc3\xa9bauch\xc3\xa9s_ look at beautiful\nwomen, with an air of being interested solely in the subject of\nconversation,\xe2\x80\x94that is, in that which did not interest him at all.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe tried to seem indifferent. But my expression, my jealous or false\nsmile, which she knew so well, and the voluptuous glances of the\nmusician, evidently excited her. I saw that, after the first interview,\nher eyes were already glittering, glittering strangely, and that,\nthanks to my jealousy, between him and her had been immediately\nestablished that sort of electric current which is provoked by an\nidentity of expression in the smile and in the eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe talked, at the first interview, of music, of Paris, and of all\nsorts of trivialities. He rose to go. Pressing his hat against his\nswaying hip, he stood erect, looking now at her and now at me, as if\nwaiting to see what she would do. I remember that minute, precisely\nbecause it was in my power not to invite him. I need not have invited\nhim, and then nothing would have happened. But I cast a glance first at\nhim, then at her. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t flatter yourself that I can be jealous of\nyou,\xe2\x80\x99 I thought, addressing myself to her mentally, and I invited the\nother to bring his violin that very evening, and to play with my wife.\nShe raised her eyes toward me with astonishment, and her face turned\npurple, as if she were seized with a sudden fear. She began to excuse\nherself, saying that she did not play well enough. This refusal only\nexcited me the more. I remember the strange feeling with which I looked\nat his neck, his white neck, in contrast with his black hair, separated\nby a parting, when, with his skipping gait, like that of a bird, he\nleft my house. I could not help confessing to myself that this man\xe2\x80\x99s\npresence caused me suffering. \xe2\x80\x98It is in my power,\xe2\x80\x99 thought I, \xe2\x80\x98to so\narrange things that I shall never see him again. But can it be that I,\n_I_, fear him? No, I do not fear him. It would be too humiliating!\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there in the hall, knowing that my wife heard me, I insisted that\nhe should come that very evening with his violin. He promised me, and\nwent away. In the evening he arrived with his violin, and they played\ntogether. But for a long time things did not go well; we had not the\nnecessary music, and that which we had my wife could not play at sight.\nI amused myself with their difficulties. I aided them, I made\nproposals, and they finally executed a few pieces,\xe2\x80\x94songs without words,\nand a little sonata by Mozart. He played in a marvellous manner. He had\nwhat is called the energetic and tender tone. As for difficulties,\nthere were none for him. Scarcely had he begun to play, when his face\nchanged. He became serious, and much more sympathetic. He was, it is\nneedless to say, much stronger than my wife. He helped her, he advised\nher simply and naturally, and at the same time played his game with\ncourtesy. My wife seemed interested only in the music. She was very\nsimple and agreeable. Throughout the evening I feigned, not only for\nthe others, but for myself, an interest solely in the music. Really, I\nwas continually tortured by jealousy. From the first minute that the\nmusician\xe2\x80\x99s eyes met those of my wife, I saw that he did not regard her\nas a disagreeable woman, with whom on occasion it would be unpleasant\nto enter into intimate relations.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had been pure, I should not have dreamed of what he might think\nof her. But I looked at women, and that is why I understood him and was\nin torture. I was in torture, especially because I was sure that toward\nme she had no other feeling than of perpetual irritation, sometimes\ninterrupted by the customary sensuality, and that this man,\xe2\x80\x94thanks to\nhis external elegance and his novelty, and, above all, thanks to his\nunquestionably remarkable talent, thanks to the attraction exercised\nunder the influence of music, thanks to the impression that music\nproduces upon nervous natures,\xe2\x80\x94this man would not only please, but\nwould inevitably, and without difficulty, subjugate and conquer her,\nand do with her as he liked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could not help seeing this. I could not help suffering, or keep from\nbeing jealous. And I was jealous, and I suffered, and in spite of that,\nand perhaps even because of that, an unknown force, in spite of my\nwill, impelled me to be not only polite, but more than polite, amiable.\nI cannot say whether I did it for my wife, or to show him that I did\nnot fear _him_, or to deceive myself; but from my first relations with\nhim I could not be at my ease. I was obliged, that I might not give way\nto a desire to kill him immediately, to \xe2\x80\x98caress\xe2\x80\x99 him. I filled his\nglass at the table, I grew enthusiastic over his playing, I talked to\nhim with an extremely amiable smile, and I invited him to dinner the\nfollowing Sunday, and to play again. I told him that I would invite\nsome of my acquaintances, lovers of his art, to hear him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo or three days later I was entering my house, in conversation with\na friend, when in the hall I suddenly felt something as heavy as a\nstone weighing on my heart, and I could not account for it. And it was\nthis, it was this: in passing through the hall, I had noticed something\nwhich reminded me of _him_. Not until I reached my study did I realize\nwhat it was, and I returned to the hall to verify my conjecture. Yes, I\nwas not mistaken. It was his overcoat (everything that belonged to him,\nI, without realizing it, had observed with extraordinary attention). I\nquestioned the servant. That was it. He had come. \xe2\x80\x9cI passed near the\nparlor, through my children\xe2\x80\x99s study-room. Lise, my daughter, was\nsitting before a book, and the old nurse, with my youngest child, was\nbeside the table, turning the cover of something or other. In the\nparlor I heard a slow _arpeggio_, and his voice, deadened, and a denial\nfrom her. She said: \xe2\x80\x98No, no! There is something else!\xe2\x80\x99 And it seemed to\nme that some one was purposely deadening the words by the aid of the\npiano.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God! How my heart leaped! What were my imaginations! When I\nremember the beast that lived in me at that moment, I am seized with\nfright. My heart was first compressed, then stopped, and then began to\nbeat like a hammer. The principal feeling, as in every bad feeling, was\npity for myself. \xe2\x80\x98Before the children, before the old nurse,\xe2\x80\x99 thought\nI, \xe2\x80\x98she dishonors me. I will go away. I can endure it no longer. God\nknows what I should do if. . . . But I must go in.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old nurse raised her eyes to mine, as if she understood, and\nadvised me to keep a sharp watch. \xe2\x80\x98I must go in,\xe2\x80\x99 I said to myself,\nand, without knowing what I did, I opened the door. He was sitting at\nthe piano and making _arpeggios_ with his long, white, curved fingers.\nShe was standing in the angle of the grand piano, before the open\nscore. She saw or heard me first, and raised her eyes to mine. Was she\nstunned, was she pretending not to be frightened, or was she really not\nfrightened at all? In any case, she did not tremble, she did not stir.\nShe blushed, but only a little later.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98How glad I am that you have come! We have not decided what we will\nplay Sunday,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, in a tone that she would not have had if she\nhad been alone with me.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis tone, and the way in which she said \xe2\x80\x98we\xe2\x80\x99 in speaking of herself\nand of him, revolted me. I saluted him silently. He shook hands with me\ndirectly, with a smile that seemed to me full of mockery. He explained\nto me that he had brought some scores, in order to prepare for the\nSunday concert, and that they were not in accord as to the piece to\nchoose,\xe2\x80\x94whether difficult, classic things, notably a sonata by\nBeethoven, or lighter pieces.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd as he spoke, he looked at me. It was all so natural, so simple,\nthat there was absolutely nothing to be said against it. And at the\nsame time I saw, I was sure, that it was false, that they were in a\nconspiracy to deceive me.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the most torturing situations for the jealous (and in our\nsocial life everybody is jealous) are those social conditions which\nallow a very great and dangerous intimacy between a man and a woman\nunder certain pretexts. One must make himself the laughing stock of\neverybody, if he desires to prevent associations in the ball-room, the\nintimacy of doctors with their patients, the familiarity of art\noccupations, and especially of music. In order that people may occupy\nthemselves together with the noblest art, music, a certain intimacy is\nnecessary, in which there is nothing blameworthy. Only a jealous fool\nof a husband can have anything to say against it. A husband should not\nhave such thoughts, and especially should not thrust his nose into\nthese affairs, or prevent them. And yet, everybody knows that precisely\nin these occupations, especially in music, many adulteries originate in\nour society.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had evidently embarrassed them, because for some time I was unable\nto say anything. I was like a bottle suddenly turned upside down, from\nwhich the water does not run because it is too full. I wanted to insult\nthe man, and to drive him away, but I could do nothing of the kind. On\nthe contrary, I felt that I was disturbing them, and that it was my\nfault. I made a presence of approving everything, this time also,\nthanks to that strange feeling that forced me to treat him the more\namiably in proportion as his presence was more painful to me. I said\nthat I trusted to his taste, and I advised my wife to do the same. He\nremained just as long as it was necessary in order to efface the\nunpleasant impression of my abrupt entrance with a frightened face. He\nwent away with an air of satisfaction at the conclusions arrived at. As\nfor me, I was perfectly sure that, in comparison with that which\npreoccupied them, the question of music was indifferent to them. I\naccompanied him with especial courtesy to the hall (how can one help\naccompanying a man who has come to disturb your tranquillity and ruin\nthe happiness of the entire family?), and I shook his white, soft hand\nwith fervent amiability.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that day I did not speak to my wife. I could not. Her proximity\nexcited such hatred that I feared myself. At the table she asked me, in\npresence of the children, when I was to start upon a journey. I was to\ngo the following week to an assembly of the Zemstvo, in a neighboring\nlocality. I named the date. She asked me if I would need anything for\nthe journey. I did not answer. I sat silent at the table, and silently\nI retired to my study. In those last days she never entered my study,\nespecially at that hour. Suddenly I heard her steps, her walk, and then\na terribly base idea entered my head that, like the wife of Uri, she\nwished to conceal a fault already committed, and that it was for this\nreason that she came to see me at this unseasonable hour. \xe2\x80\x98Is it\npossible,\xe2\x80\x99 thought I, \xe2\x80\x98that she is coming to see me?\xe2\x80\x99 On hearing her\nstep as it approached: \xe2\x80\x98If it is to see me that she is coming, then I\nam right.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn inexpressible hatred invaded my soul. The steps drew nearer, and\nnearer, and nearer yet. Would she pass by and go on to the other room?\nNo, the hinges creaked, and at the door her tall, graceful, languid\nfigure appeared. In her face, in her eyes, a timidity, an insinuating\nexpression, which she tried to hide, but which I saw, and of which I\nunderstood the meaning. I came near suffocating, such were my efforts\nto hold my breath, and, continuing to look at her, I took my cigarette,\nand lighted it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What does this mean? One comes to talk with you, and you go to\nsmoking.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she sat down beside me on the sofa, resting against my shoulder. I\nrecoiled, that I might not touch her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I see that you are displeased with what I wish to play on Sunday,\xe2\x80\x99\nsaid she.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I am not at all displeased,\xe2\x80\x99 said I.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Can I not see?\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Well, I congratulate you on your clairvoyance. Only to you every\nbaseness is agreeable, and I abhor it.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98If you are going to swear like a trooper, I am going away.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Then go away. Only know that, if the honor of the family is nothing\nto you, to me it is dear. As for you, the devil take you!\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What! What is the matter?\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Go away, in the name of God.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she did not go away. Was she pretending not to understand, or did\nshe really not understand what I meant? But she was offended and became\nangry.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You have become absolutely impossible,\xe2\x80\x99 she began, or some such\nphrase as that regarding my character, trying, as usual, to give me as\nmuch pain as possible. \xe2\x80\x98After what you have done to my sister (she\nreferred to an incident with her sister, in which, beside myself, I had\nuttered brutalities; she knew that that tortured me, and tried to touch\nme in that tender spot) nothing will astonish me.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes, offended, humiliated, and dishonored, and after that to hold me\nstill responsible,\xe2\x80\x99 thought I, and suddenly a rage, such a hatred\ninvaded me as I do not remember to have ever felt before. For the first\ntime I desired to express this hatred physically. I leaped upon her,\nbut at the same moment I understood my condition, and I asked myself\nwhether it would be well for me to abandon myself to my fury. And I\nanswered myself that it would be well, that it would frighten her, and,\ninstead of resisting, I lashed and spurred myself on, and was glad to\nfeel my anger boiling more and more fiercely.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Go away, or I will kill you!\xe2\x80\x99 I cried, purposely, with a frightful\nvoice, and I grasped her by the arm. She did not go away. Then I\ntwisted her arm, and pushed her away violently.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What is the matter with you? Come to your senses!\xe2\x80\x99 she shrieked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Go away,\xe2\x80\x99 roared I, louder than ever, rolling my eyes wildly. \xe2\x80\x98It\ntakes you to put me in such a fury. I do not answer for myself! Go\naway!\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn abandoning myself to my anger, I became steeped in it, and I wanted\nto commit some violent act to show the force of my fury. I felt a\nterrible desire to beat her, to kill her, but I realized that that\ncould not be, and I restrained myself. I drew back from her, rushed to\nthe table, grasped the paper-weight, and threw it on the floor by her\nside. I took care to aim a little to one side, and, before she\ndisappeared (I did it so that she could see it), I grasped a\ncandlestick, which I also hurled, and then took down the barometer,\ncontinuing to shout:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Go away! I do not answer for myself!\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe disappeared, and I immediately ceased my demonstrations. An hour\nlater the old servant came to me and said that my wife was in a fit of\nhysterics. I went to see her. She sobbed and laughed, incapable of\nexpressing anything, her whole body in a tremble. She was not shamming,\nshe was really sick. We sent for the doctor, and all night long I cared\nfor her. Toward daylight she grew calmer, and we became reconciled\nunder the influence of that feeling which we called \xe2\x80\x98love.\xe2\x80\x99 The next\nmorning, when, after the reconciliation, I confessed to her that I was\njealous of Troukhatchevsky, she was not at all embarrassed, and began\nto laugh in the most natural way, so strange did the possibility of\nbeing led astray by such a man appear to her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98With such a man can an honest woman entertain any feeling beyond the\npleasure of enjoying music with him? But if you like, I am ready to\nnever see him again, even on Sunday, although everybody has been\ninvited. Write him that I am indisposed, and that will end the matter.\nOnly one thing annoys me,\xe2\x80\x94that any one could have thought him\ndangerous. I am too proud not to detest such thoughts.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she did not lie. She believed what she said. She hoped by her\nwords to provoke in herself a contempt for him, and thereby to defend\nherself. But she did not succeed. Everything was directed against her,\nespecially that abominable music. So ended the quarrel, and on Sunday\nour guests came, and Troukhatchevsky and my wife again played\ntogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think that it is superfluous to say that I was very vain. If one has\nno vanity in this life of ours, there is no sufficient reason for\nliving. So for that Sunday I had busied myself in tastefully arranging\nthings for the dinner and the musical _soir\xc3\xa9e_. I had purchased myself\nnumerous things for the dinner, and had chosen the guests. Toward six\no\xe2\x80\x99clock they arrived, and after them Troukhatchevsky, in his\ndress-coat, with diamond shirt-studs, in bad taste. He bore himself\nwith ease. To all questions he responded promptly, with a smile of\ncontentment and understanding, and that peculiar expression which was\nintended to mean: \xe2\x80\x98All that you may do and say will be exactly what I\nexpected.\xe2\x80\x99 Everything about him that was not correct I now noticed with\nespecial pleasure, for it all tended to tranquillize me, and prove to\nme that to my wife he stood in such a degree of inferiority that, as\nshe had told me, she could not stoop to his level. Less because of my\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s assurances than because of the atrocious sufferings which I felt\nin jealousy, I no longer allowed myself to be jealous.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn spite of that, I was not at ease with the musician or with her\nduring dinner-time and the time that elapsed before the beginning of\nthe music. Involuntarily I followed each of their gestures and looks.\nThe dinner, like all dinners, was tiresome and conventional. Not long\nafterward the music began. He went to get his violin; my wife advanced\nto the piano, and rummaged among the scores. Oh, how well I remember\nall the details of that evening! I remember how he brought the violin,\nhow he opened the box, took off the serge embroidered by a lady\xe2\x80\x99s hand,\nand began to tune the instrument. I can still see my wife sit down,\nwith a false air of indifference, under which it was plain that she hid\na great timidity, a timidity that was especially due to her comparative\nlack of musical knowledge. She sat down with that false air in front of\nthe piano, and then began the usual preliminaries,\xe2\x80\x94the _pizzicati_ of\nthe violin and the arrangement of the scores. I remember then how they\nlooked at each other, and cast a glance at their auditors who were\ntaking their seats. They said a few words to each other, and the music\nbegan. They played Beethoven\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Kreutzer Sonata.\xe2\x80\x99 Do you know the first\n_presto?_ Do you know it? Ah!\xe2\x80\x9d . . .\n\nPosdnicheff heaved a sigh, and was silent for a long time.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA terrible thing is that sonata, especially the _presto!_ And a\nterrible thing is music in general. What is it? Why does it do what it\ndoes? They say that music stirs the soul. Stupidity! A lie! It acts, it\nacts frightfully (I speak for myself), but not in an ennobling way. It\nacts neither in an ennobling nor a debasing way, but in an irritating\nway. How shall I say it? Music makes me forget my real situation. It\ntransports me into a state which is not my own. Under the influence of\nmusic I really seem to feel what I do not feel, to understand what I do\nnot understand, to have powers which I cannot have. Music seems to me\nto act like yawning or laughter; I have no desire to sleep, but I yawn\nwhen I see others yawn; with no reason to laugh, I laugh when I hear\nothers laugh. And music transports me immediately into the condition of\nsoul in which he who wrote the music found himself at that time. I\nbecome confounded with his soul, and with him I pass from one condition\nto another. But why that? I know nothing about it? But he who wrote\nBeethoven\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Kreutzer Sonata\xe2\x80\x99 knew well why he found himself in a\ncertain condition. That condition led him to certain actions, and for\nthat reason to him had a meaning, but to me none, none whatever. And\nthat is why music provokes an excitement which it does not bring to a\nconclusion. For instance, a military march is played; the soldier\npasses to the sound of this march, and the music is finished. A dance\nis played; I have finished dancing, and the music is finished. A mass\nis sung; I receive the sacrament, and again the music is finished. But\nany other music provokes an excitement, and this excitement is not\naccompanied by the thing that needs properly to be done, and that is\nwhy music is so dangerous, and sometimes acts so frightfully.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn China music is under the control of the State, and that is the way\nit ought to be. Is it admissible that the first comer should hypnotize\none or more persons, and then do with them as he likes? And especially\nthat the hypnotizer should be the first immoral individual who happens\nto come along? It is a frightful power in the hands of any one, no\nmatter whom. For instance, should they be allowed to play this\n\xe2\x80\x98Kreutzer Sonata,\xe2\x80\x99 the first _presto_,\xe2\x80\x94and there are many like it,\xe2\x80\x94in\nparlors, among ladies wearing low necked dresses, or in concerts, then\nfinish the piece, receive the applause, and then begin another piece?\nThese things should be played under certain circumstances, only in\ncases where it is necessary to incite certain actions corresponding to\nthe music. But to incite an energy of feeling which corresponds to\nneither the time nor the place, and is expended in nothing, cannot fail\nto act dangerously. On me in particular this piece acted in a frightful\nmanner. One would have said that new sentiments, new virtualities, of\nwhich I was formerly ignorant, had developed in me. \xe2\x80\x98Ah, yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s\nit! Not at all as I lived and thought before! This is the right way to\nlive!\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus I spoke to my soul as I listened to that music. What was this new\nthing that I thus learned? That I did not realize, but the\nconsciousness of this indefinite state filled me with joy. In that\nstate there was no room for jealousy. The same faces, and among them\n_he_ and my wife, I saw in a different light. This music transported me\ninto an unknown world, where there was no room for jealousy. Jealousy\nand the feelings that provoke it seemed to me trivialities, nor worth\nthinking of.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter the _presto_ followed the _andante_, not very new, with\ncommonplace variations, and the feeble _finale_. Then they played more,\nat the request of the guests,\xe2\x80\x94first an elegy by Ernst, and then various\nother pieces. They were all very well, but did not produce upon me a\ntenth part of the impression that the opening piece did. I felt light\nand gay throughout the evening. As for my wife, never had I seen her as\nshe was that night. Those brilliant eyes, that severity and majestic\nexpression while she was playing, and then that utter languor, that\nweak, pitiable, and happy smile after she had finished,\xe2\x80\x94I saw them all\nand attached no importance to them, believing that she felt as I did,\nthat to her, as to me, new sentiments had been revealed, as through a\nfog. During almost the whole evening I was not jealous.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo days later I was to start for the assembly of the Zemstvo, and for\nthat reason, on taking leave of me and carrying all his scores with\nhim, Troukhatchevsky asked me when I should return. I inferred from\nthat that he believed it impossible to come to my house during my\nabsence, and that was agreeable to me. Now I was not to return before\nhis departure from the city. So we bade each other a definite farewell.\nFor the first time I shook his hand with pleasure, and thanked him for\nthe satisfaction that he had given me. He likewise took leave of my\nwife, and their parting seemed to me very natural and proper. All went\nmarvellously. My wife and I retired, well satisfied with the evening.\nWe talked of our impressions in a general way, and we were nearer\ntogether and more friendly than we had been for a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo days later I started for the assembly, having bid farewell to my\nwife in an excellent and tranquil state of mind. In the district there\nwas always much to be done. It was a world and a life apart. During two\ndays I spent ten hours at the sessions. The evening of the second day,\non returning to my district lodgings, I found a letter from my wife,\ntelling me of the children, of their uncle, of the servants, and, among\nother things, as if it were perfectly natural, that Troukhatchevsky had\nbeen at the house, and had brought her the promised scores. He had also\nproposed that they play again, but she had refused.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor my part, I did not remember at all that he had promised any score.\nIt had seemed to me on Sunday evening that he took a definite leave,\nand for this reason the news gave me a disagreeable surprise. I read\nthe letter again. There was something tender and timid about it. It\nproduced an extremely painful impression upon me. My heart swelled, and\nthe mad beast of jealousy began to roar in his lair, and seemed to want\nto leap upon his prey. But I was afraid of this beast, and I imposed\nsilence upon it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an abominable sentiment is jealousy! \xe2\x80\x98What could be more natural\nthan what she has written?\xe2\x80\x99 said I to myself. I went to bed, thinking\nmyself tranquil again. I thought of the business that remained to be\ndone, and I went to sleep without thinking of her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuring these assemblies of the Zemstvo I always slept badly in my\nstrange quarters. That night I went to sleep directly, but, as\nsometimes happens, a sort of sudden shock awoke me. I thought\nimmediately of her, of my physical love for her, of Troukhatchevsky,\nand that between them everything had happened. And a feeling of rage\ncompressed my heart, and I tried to quiet myself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98How stupid!\xe2\x80\x99 said I to myself; \xe2\x80\x98there is no reason, none at all. And\nwhy humiliate ourselves, herself and myself, and especially myself, by\nsupposing such horrors? This mercenary violinist, known as a bad\nman,\xe2\x80\x94shall I think of him in connection with a respectable woman, the\nmother of a family, _my_ wife? How silly!\xe2\x80\x99 But on the other hand, I\nsaid to myself: \xe2\x80\x98Why should it not happen?\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Was it not the same simple and intelligible feeling in the name\nof which I married, in the name of which I was living with her, the\nonly thing I wanted of her, and that which, consequently, others\ndesired, this musician among the rest? He was not married, was in good\nhealth (I remember how his teeth ground the gristle of the cutlets, and\nhow eagerly he emptied the glass of wine with his red lips), was\ncareful of his person, well fed, and not only without principles, but\nevidently with the principle that one should take advantage of the\npleasure that offers itself. There was a bond between them, music,\xe2\x80\x94the\nmost refined form of sensual voluptuousness. What was there to restrain\nthem? Nothing. Everything, on the contrary, attracted them. And she,\nshe had been and had remained a mystery. I did not know her. I knew her\nonly as an animal, and an animal nothing can or should restrain. And\nnow I remember their faces on Sunday evening, when, after the \xe2\x80\x98Kreutzer\nSonata,\xe2\x80\x99 they played a passionate piece, written I know not by whom,\nbut a piece passionate to the point of obscenity.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98How could I have gone away?\xe2\x80\x99 said I to myself, as I recalled their\nfaces. \xe2\x80\x98Was it not clear that between them everything was done that\nevening? Was it not clear that between them not only there were no more\nobstacles, but that both\xe2\x80\x94especially she\xe2\x80\x94felt a certain shame after what\nhad happened at the piano? How weakly, pitiably, happily she smiled, as\nshe wiped the perspiration from her reddened face! They already avoided\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and only at the supper, when she poured some water\nfor him, did they look at each other and smile imperceptibly.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I remember with fright that look and that scarcely perceptible\nsmile. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, everything has happened,\xe2\x80\x99 a voice said to me, and directly\nanother said the opposite. \xe2\x80\x98Are you mad? It is impossible!\xe2\x80\x99 said the\nsecond voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was too painful to me to remain thus stretched in the darkness. I\nstruck a match, and the little yellow-papered room frightened me. I\nlighted a cigarette, and, as always happens, when one turns in a circle\nof inextricable contradiction, I began to smoke. I smoked cigarette\nafter cigarette to dull my senses, that I might not see my\ncontradictions. All night I did not sleep, and at five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when it\nwas not yet light, I decided that I could stand this strain no longer,\nand that I would leave directly. There was a train at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock. I\nawakened the keeper who was acting as my servant, and sent him to look\nfor horses. To the assembly of Zemstvo I sent a message that I was\ncalled back to Moscow by pressing business, and that I begged them to\nsubstitute for me a member of the Committee. At eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock I got\ninto a _tarantass_ and started off.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had to go twenty-five versts by carriage and eight hours by train.\nBy carriage it was a very pleasant journey. The coolness of autumn was\naccompanied by a brilliant sun. You know the weather when the wheels\nimprint themselves upon the dirty road. The road was level, and the\nlight strong, and the air strengthening. The _tarantass_ was\ncomfortable. As I looked at the horses, the fields, and the people whom\nwe passed, I forgot where I was going. Sometimes it seemed to me that I\nwas travelling without an object,\xe2\x80\x94simply promenading,\xe2\x80\x94and that I should\ngo on thus to the end of the world. And I was happy when I so forgot\nmyself. But when I remembered where I was going, I said to myself: \xe2\x80\x98I\nshall see later. Don\xe2\x80\x99t think about it.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen half way, an incident happened to distract me still further. The\n_tarantass_, though new, broke down, and had to be repaired. The delays\nin looking for a _t\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8gue_, the repairs, the payment, the tea in the\ninn, the conversation with the _dvornik_, all served to amuse me.\nToward nightfall all was ready, and I started off again. By night the\njourney was still pleasanter than by day. The moon in its first\nquarter, a slight frost, the road still in good condition, the horses,\nthe sprightly coachman, all served to put me in good spirits. I\nscarcely thought of what awaited me, and was gay perhaps because of the\nvery thing that awaited me, and because I was about to say farewell to\nthe joys of life.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this tranquil state, the power of conquering my preoccupation, all\nended with the carriage drive. Scarcely had I entered the cars, when\nthe other thing began. Those eight hours on the rail were so terrible\nto me that I shall never forget them in my life. Was it because on\nentering the car I had a vivid imagination of having already arrived,\nor because the railway acts upon people in such an exciting fashion? At\nany rate, after boarding the train I could no longer control my\nimagination, which incessantly, with extraordinary vivacity, drew\npictures before my eyes, each more cynical than its predecessor, which\nkindled my jealousy. And always the same things about what was\nhappening at home during my absence. I burned with indignation, with\nrage, and with a peculiar feeling which steeped me in humiliation, as I\ncontemplated these pictures. And I could not tear myself out of this\ncondition. I could not help looking at them, I could not efface them, I\ncould not keep from evoking them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe more I looked at these imaginary pictures, the more I believed in\ntheir reality, forgetting that they had no serious foundation. The\nvivacity of these images seemed to prove to me that my imaginations\nwere a reality. One would have said that a demon, against my will, was\ninventing and breathing into me the most terrible fictions. A\nconversation which dated a long time back, with the brother of\nTroukhatchevsky, I remembered at that moment, in a sort of ecstasy, and\nit tore my heart as I connected it with the musician and my wife. Yes,\nit was very long ago. The brother of Troukhatchevsky, answering my\nquestions as to whether he frequented disreputable houses, said that a\nrespectable man does not go where he may contract a disease, in a low\nand unclean spot, when one can find an honest woman. And here he, his\nbrother, the musician, had found the honest woman. \xe2\x80\x98It is true that she\nis no longer in her early youth. She has lost a tooth on one side, and\nher face is slightly bloated,\xe2\x80\x99 thought I for Troukhatchevsky. \xe2\x80\x98But what\nis to be done? One must profit by what one has.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes, he is bound to take her for his mistress,\xe2\x80\x99 said I to myself\nagain; \xe2\x80\x98and besides, she is not dangerous.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98No, it is not possible\xe2\x80\x99 I rejoined in fright. \xe2\x80\x98Nothing, nothing of\nthe kind has happened, and there is no reason to suppose there has. Did\nshe not tell me that the very idea that I could be jealous of her\nbecause of him was humiliating to her?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes, but she lied,\xe2\x80\x99 I cried,\nand all began over again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were only two travellers in my compartment: an old woman with\nher husband, neither of them very talkative; and even they got out at\none of the stations, leaving me all alone. I was like a beast in a\ncage. Now I jumped up and approached the window, now I began to walk\nback and forth, staggering as if I hoped to make the train go faster by\nmy efforts, and the car with its seats and its windows trembled\ncontinually, as ours does now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Posdnicheff rose abruptly, took a few steps, and sat down again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am afraid, I am afraid of railway carriages. Fear seizes me. I\nsat down again, and I said to myself: \xe2\x80\x98I must think of something else.\nFor instance, of the inn keeper at whose house I took tea.\xe2\x80\x99 And then,\nin my imagination arose the _dvornik_, with his long beard, and his\ngrandson, a little fellow of the same age as my little Basile. My\nlittle Basile! My little Basile! He will see the musician kiss his\nmother! What thoughts will pass through his poor soul! But what does\nthat matter to her! She loves.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd again it all began, the circle of the same thoughts. I suffered so\nmuch that at last I did not know what to do with myself, and an idea\npassed through my head that pleased me much,\xe2\x80\x94to get out upon the rails,\nthrow myself under the cars, and thus finish everything. One thing\nprevented me from doing so. It was pity! It was pity for myself,\nevoking at the same time a hatred for her, for him, but not so much for\nhim. Toward him I felt a strange sentiment of my humiliation and his\nvictory, but toward her a terrible hatred.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98But I cannot kill myself and leave her free. She must suffer, she\nmust understand at least that I have suffered,\xe2\x80\x99 said I to myself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt a station I saw people drinking at the lunch counter, and directly\nI went to swallow a glass of vodka. Beside me stood a Jew, drinking\nalso. He began to talk to me, and I, in order not to be left alone in\nmy compartment, went with him into his third-class, dirty, full of\nsmoke, and covered with peelings and sunflower seeds. There I sat down\nbeside the Jew, and, as it seemed, he told many anecdotes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst I listened to him, but I did not understand what he said. He\nnoticed it, and exacted my attention to his person. Then I rose and\nentered my own compartment.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I must consider,\xe2\x80\x99 said I to myself, \xe2\x80\x98whether what I think is true,\nwhether there is any reason to torment myself.\xe2\x80\x99 I sat down, wishing to\nreflect quietly; but directly, instead of the peaceful reflections, the\nsame thing began again. Instead of the reasoning, the pictures.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98How many times have I tormented myself in this way,\xe2\x80\x99 I thought (I\nrecalled previous and similar fits of jealousy), \xe2\x80\x98and then seen it end\nin nothing at all? It is the same now. Perhaps, yes, surely, I shall\nfind her quietly sleeping. She will awaken, she will be glad, and in\nher words and looks I shall see that nothing has happened, that all\nthis is vain. Ah, if it would only so turn out!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98But no, that has\nhappened too often! Now the end has come,\xe2\x80\x99 a voice said to me.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd again it all began. Ah, what torture! It is not to a hospital\nfilled with syphilitic patients that I would take a young man to\ndeprive him of the desire for women, but into my soul, to show him the\ndemon which tore it. The frightful part was that I recognized in myself\nan indisputable right to the body of my wife, as if her body were\nentirely mine. And at the same time I felt that I could not possess\nthis body, that it was not mine, that she could do with it as she\nliked, and that she liked to do with it as I did not like. And I was\npowerless against him and against her. He, like the Vanka of the song,\nwould sing, before mounting the gallows, how he would kiss her sweet\nlips, etc., and he would even have the best of it before death. With\nher it was still worse. If she _had not done it_, she had the desire,\nshe wished to do it, and I knew that she did. That was worse yet. It\nwould be better if she had already done it, to relieve me of my\nuncertainty.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn short, I could not say what I desired. I desired that she might not\nwant what she _must_ want. It was complete madness.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the station before the last, when the conductor came to take the\ntickets, I took my baggage and went out on the car platform, and the\nconsciousness that the climax was near at hand only added to my\nagitation. I was cold, my jaw trembled so that my teeth chattered.\nMechanically I left the station with the crowd, I took a _tchik_, and I\nstarted. I looked at the few people passing in the streets and at the\n_dvorniks_. I read the signs, without thinking of anything. After going\nhalf a verst my feet began to feel cold, and I remembered that in the\ncar I had taken off my woollen socks, and had put them in my travelling\nbag. Where had I put the bag? Was it with me? Yes, and the basket?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bethought myself that I had totally forgotten my baggage. I took out\nmy check, and then decided it was not worth while to return. I\ncontinued on my way. In spite of all my efforts to remember, I cannot\nat this moment make out why I was in such a hurry. I know only that I\nwas conscious that a serious and menacing event was approaching in my\nlife. It was a case of real auto-suggestion. Was it so serious because\nI thought it so? Or had I a presentiment? I do not know. Perhaps, too,\nafter what has happened, all previous events have taken on a lugubrious\ntint in my memory.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI arrived at the steps. It was an hour past midnight. A few\n_isvotchiks_ were before the door, awaiting customers, attracted by the\nlighted windows (the lighted windows were those of our parlor and\nreception room). Without trying to account for this late illumination,\nI went up the steps, always with the same expectation of something\nterrible, and I rang. The servant, a good, industrious, and very stupid\nbeing, named Gregor, opened the door. The first thing that leaped to my\neyes in the hall, on the hat-stand, among other garments, was an\novercoat. I ought to have been astonished, but I was not astonished. I\nexpected it. \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s it!\xe2\x80\x99 I said to myself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I had asked Gregor who was there, and he had named\nTroukhatchevsky, I inquired whether there were other visitors. He\nanswered: \xe2\x80\x98Nobody.\xe2\x80\x99 I remember the air with which he said that, with a\ntone that was intended to give me pleasure, and dissipate my doubts.\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s it! that\xe2\x80\x99s it!\xe2\x80\x99 I had the air of saying to myself. \xe2\x80\x98And the\nchildren?\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Thank God, they are very well. They went to sleep long ago.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI scarcely breathed, and I could not keep my jaw from trembling.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it was not as I thought. I had often before returned home with\nthe thought that a misfortune had awaited me, but had been mistaken,\nand everything was going on as usual. But now things were not going on\nas usual. All that I had imagined, all that I believed to be chimeras,\nall really existed. Here was the truth.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was on the point of sobbing, but straightway the demon whispered in\nmy ear: \xe2\x80\x98Weep and be sentimental, and they will separate quietly, and\nthere will be no proofs, and all your life you will doubt and suffer.\xe2\x80\x99\nAnd pity for myself vanished, and there remained only the bestial need\nof some adroit, cunning, and energetic action. I became a beast, an\nintelligent beast.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98No, no,\xe2\x80\x99 said I to Gregor, who was about to announce my arrival. \xe2\x80\x98Do\nthis, take a carriage, and go at once for my baggage. Here is the\ncheck. Start.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe went along the hall to get his overcoat. Fearing lest he might\nfrighten them, I accompanied him to his little room, and waited for him\nto put on his things. In the dining-room could be heard the sound of\nconversation and the rattling of knives and plates. They were eating.\nThey had not heard the ring. \xe2\x80\x98Now if they only do not go out,\xe2\x80\x99 I\nthought.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGregor put on his fur-collared coat and went out. I closed the door\nafter him. I felt anxious when I was alone, thinking that directly I\nshould have to act. How? I did not yet know. I knew only that all was\nended, that there could be no doubt of _his_ innocence, and that in an\ninstant my relations with her were going to be terminated. Before, I\nhad still doubts. I said to myself: \xe2\x80\x98Perhaps this is not true. Perhaps\nI am mistaken.\xe2\x80\x99 Now all doubt had disappeared. All was decided\nirrevocably. Secretly, all alone with him, at night! It is a violation\nof all duties! Or, worse yet, she may make a show of that audacity, of\nthat insolence in crime, which, by its excess, tends to prove\ninnocence. All is clear. No doubt. I feared but one thing,\xe2\x80\x94that they\nmight run in different directions, that they might invent some new lie,\nand thus deprive me of material proof, and of the sorrowful joy of\npunishing, yes, of executing them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to surprise them more quickly, I started on tiptoe for the\ndining-room, not through the parlor, but through the hall and the\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s rooms. In the first room slept the little boy. In the\nsecond, the old nurse moved in her bed, and seemed on the point of\nwaking, and I wondered what she would think when she knew all. And pity\nfor myself gave me such a pang that I could not keep the tears back.\nNot to wake the children, I ran lightly through the hall into my study.\nI dropped upon the sofa, and sobbed. \xe2\x80\x98I, an honest man, I, the son of\nmy parents, who all my life long have dreamed of family happiness, I\nwho have never betrayed! . . . And here my five children, and she\nembracing a musician because he has red lips! No, she is not a woman!\nShe is a bitch, a dirty bitch! Beside the chamber of the children, whom\nshe had pretended to love all her life! And then to think of what she\nwrote me! And how do I know? Perhaps it has always been thus. Perhaps\nall these children, supposed to be mine, are the children of my\nservants. And if I had arrived to-morrow, she would have come to meet\nme with her _coiffure_, with her _corsage_, her indolent and graceful\nmovements (and I see her attractive and ignoble features), and this\njealous animal would have remained forever in my heart, tearing it.\nWhat will the old nurse say? And Gregor? And the poor little Lise? She\nalready understands things. And this impudence, this falsehood, this\nbestial sensuality, that I know so well,\xe2\x80\x99 I said to myself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tried to rise. I could not. My heart was beating so violently that I\ncould not hold myself upon my legs. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, I shall die of a rush of\nblood. She will kill me. That is what she wants. What is it to her to\nkill? But that would be too agreeable to him, and I will not allow him\nto have this pleasure.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, here I am, and there they are. They are laughing, they. . . .\nYes, in spite of the fact that she is no longer in her early youth, he\nhas not disdained her. At any rate, she is by no means ugly, and above\nall, not dangerous to his dear health, to him. Why did I not stifle her\nthen?\xe2\x80\x99 said I to myself, as I remembered that other scene of the\nprevious week, when I drove her from my study, and broke the furniture.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I recalled the state in which I was then. Not only did I recall\nit, but I again entered into the same bestial state. And suddenly there\ncame to me a desire to act, and all reasoning, except such as was\nnecessary to action, vanished from my brain, and I was in the condition\nof a beast, and of a man under the influence of physical excitement\npending a danger, who acts imperturbably, without haste, and yet\nwithout losing a minute, pursuing a definite object.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first thing that I did was to take off my boots, and now, having\nonly stockings on, I advanced toward the wall, over the sofa, where\nfirearms and daggers were hanging, and I took down a curved Damascus\nblade, which I had never used, and which was very sharp. I took it from\nits sheath. I remember that the sheath fell upon the sofa, and that I\nsaid to myself: \xe2\x80\x98I must look for it later; it must not be lost.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I took off my overcoat, which I had kept on all the time, and\nwith wolf-like tread started for _the room_. I do not remember how I\nproceeded, whether I ran or went slowly, through what chambers I\npassed, how I approached the dining-room, how I opened the door, how I\nentered. I remember nothing about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember only the expression of their faces when I opened the door.\nI remember that, because it awakened in me a feeling of sorrowful joy.\nIt was an expression of terror, such as I desired. Never shall I forget\nthat desperate and sudden fright that appeared on their faces when they\nsaw me. He, I believe, was at the table, and, when he saw or heard me,\nhe started, jumped to his feet, and retreated to the sideboard. Fear\nwas the only sentiment that could be read with certainty in his face.\nIn hers, too, fear was to be read, but accompanied by other\nimpressions. And yet, if her face had expressed only fear, perhaps that\nwhich happened would not have happened. But in the expression of her\nface there was at the first moment\xe2\x80\x94at least, I thought I saw it\xe2\x80\x94a\nfeeling of _ennui_, of discontent, at this disturbance of her love and\nhappiness. One would have said that her sole desire was not to be\ndisturbed _in the moment of her happiness_. But these expressions\nappeared upon their faces only for a moment. Terror almost immediately\ngave place to interrogation. Would they lie or not? If yes, they must\nbegin. If not, something else was going to happen. But what?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe gave her a questioning glance. On her face the expression of\nanguish and _ennui_ changed, it seemed to me, when she looked at him,\ninto an expression of anxiety for _him_. For a moment I stood in the\ndoorway, holding the dagger hidden behind my back. Suddenly he smiled,\nand in a voice that was indifferent almost to the point of ridicule, he\nsaid:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98We were having some music.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I did not expect\xe2\x80\x94,\xe2\x80\x99 she began at the same time, chiming in with the\ntone of the other.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut neither he nor she finished their remarks. The same rage that I\nhad felt the previous week took possession of me. I felt the need of\ngiving free course to my violence and \xe2\x80\x98the joy of wrath.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, they did not finish. That other thing was going to begin, of which\nhe was afraid, and was going to annihilate what they wanted to say. I\nthrew myself upon her, still hiding the dagger, that he might not\nprevent me from striking where I desired, in her bosom, under the\nbreast. At that moment he saw . . . and, what I did not expect on his\npart, he quickly seized my hand, and cried:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Come to your senses! What are you doing? Help! Help!\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tore my hands from his grasp, and leaped upon him. I must have been\nvery terrible, for he turned as white as a sheet, to his lips. His eyes\nscintillated singularly, and\xe2\x80\x94again what I did not expect of him\xe2\x80\x94he\nscrambled under the piano, toward the other room. I tried to follow\nhim, but a very heavy weight fell upon my left arm. It was she.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI made an effort to clear myself. She clung more heavily than ever,\nrefusing to let go. This unexpected obstacle, this burden, and this\nrepugnant touch only irritated me the more. I perceived that I was\ncompletely mad, that I must be frightful, and I was glad of it. With a\nsudden impulse, and with all my strength, I dealt her, with my left\nelbow, a blow squarely in the face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe uttered a cry and let go my arm. I wanted to follow the other, but\nI felt that it would be ridiculous to pursue in my stockings the lover\nof my wife, and I did not wish to be grotesque, I wished to be\nterrible. In spite of my extreme rage, I was all the time conscious of\nthe impression that I was making upon others, and even this impression\npartially guided me.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI turned toward her. She had fallen on the long easy chair, and,\ncovering her face at the spot where I had struck her, she looked at me.\nHer features exhibited fear and hatred toward me, her enemy, such as\nthe rat exhibits when one lifts the rat-trap. At least, I saw nothing\nin her but that fear and hatred, the fear and hatred which love for\nanother had provoked. Perhaps I still should have restrained myself,\nand should not have gone to the last extremity, if she had maintained\nsilence. But suddenly she began to speak; she grasped my hand that held\nthe dagger.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Come to your senses! What are you doing? What is the matter with you?\nNothing has happened, nothing, nothing! I swear it to you!\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might have delayed longer, but these last words, from which I\ninferred the contrary of what they affirmed,\xe2\x80\x94that is, that _everything_\nhad happened,\xe2\x80\x94these words called for a reply. And the reply must\ncorrespond to the condition into which I had lashed myself, and which\nwas increasing and must continue to increase. Rage has its laws.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Do not lie, wretch. Do not lie!\xe2\x80\x99 I roared.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith my left hand I seized her hands. She disengaged herself. Then,\nwithout dropping my dagger, I seized her by the throat, forced her to\nthe floor, and began to strangle her. With her two hands she clutched\nmine, tearing them from her throat, stifling. Then I struck her a blow\nwith the dagger, in the left side, between the lower ribs.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen people say that they do not remember what they do in a fit of\nfury, they talk nonsense. It is false. I remember everything.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not lose my consciousness for a single moment. The more I lashed\nmyself to fury, the clearer my mind became, and I could not help seeing\nwhat I did. I cannot say that I knew in advance what I would do, but at\nthe moment when I acted, and it seems to me even a little before, I\nknew what I was doing, as if to make it possible to repent, and to be\nable to say later that I could have stopped.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew that I struck the blow between the ribs, and that the dagger\nentered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the second when I did it, I knew that I was performing a horrible\nact, such as I had never performed,\xe2\x80\x94an act that would have frightful\nconsequences. My thought was as quick as lightning, and the deed\nfollowed immediately. The act, to my inner sense, had an extraordinary\nclearness. I perceived the resistance of the corset and then something\nelse, and then the sinking of the knife into a soft substance. She\nclutched at the dagger with her hands, and cut herself with it, but\ncould not restrain the blow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLong afterward, in prison when the moral revolution had been effected\nwithin me, I thought of that minute, I remembered it as far as I could,\nand I co-ordinated all the sudden changes. I remembered the terrible\nconsciousness which I felt,\xe2\x80\x94that I was killing a wife, _my_ wife.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI well remember the horror of that consciousness and I know vaguely\nthat, having plunged in the dagger, I drew it out again immediately,\nwishing to repair and arrest my action. She straightened up and cried:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Nurse, he has killed me!\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old nurse, who had heard the noise, was standing in the doorway. I\nwas still erect, waiting, and not believing myself in what had\nhappened. But at that moment, from under her corset, the blood gushed\nforth. Then only did I understand that all reparation was impossible,\nand promptly I decided that it was not even necessary, that all had\nhappened in accordance with my wish, and that I had fulfilled my\ndesire. I waited until she fell, and until the nurse, exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x98Oh,\nmy God!\xe2\x80\x99 ran to her; then only I threw away the dagger and went out of\nthe room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I must not be agitated. I must be conscious of what I am doing,\xe2\x80\x99 I\nsaid to myself, looking neither at her nor at the old nurse. The latter\ncried and called the maid. I passed through the hall, and, after having\nsent the maid, started for my study.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What shall I do now?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked myself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd immediately I understood what I should do. Directly after entering\nthe study, I went straight to the wall, took down the revolver, and\nexamined it attentively. It was loaded. Then I placed it on the table.\nNext I picked up the sheath of the dagger, which had dropped down\nbehind the sofa, and then I sat down. I remained thus for a long time.\nI thought of nothing, I did not try to remember anything. I heard a\nstifled noise of steps, a movement of objects and of tapestries, then\nthe arrival of a person, and then the arrival of another person. Then I\nsaw Gregor bring into my room the baggage from the railway; as if any\none needed it!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Have you heard what has happened?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked him. \xe2\x80\x98Have you told the\n_dvornik_ to inform the police?\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe made no answer, and went out. I rose, closed the door, took the\ncigarettes and the matches, and began to smoke. I had not finished one\ncigarette, when a drowsy feeling came over me and sent me into a deep\nsleep. I surely slept two hours. I remember having dreamed that I was\non good terms with her, that after a quarrel we were in the act of\nmaking up, that something prevented us, but that we were friends all\nthe same.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA knock at the door awoke me.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98It is the police,\xe2\x80\x99 thought I, as I opened my eyes. \xe2\x80\x98I have killed, I\nbelieve. But perhaps it is _she;_ perhaps nothing has happened.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother knock. I did not answer. I was solving the question: \xe2\x80\x98Has it\nhappened or not? Yes, it has happened.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remembered the resistance of the corset, and then. . . . \xe2\x80\x98Yes, it\nhas happened. Yes, it has happened. Yes, now I must execute myself,\xe2\x80\x99\nsaid I to myself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said it, but I knew well that I should not kill myself.\nNevertheless, I rose and took the revolver, but, strange thing, I\nremembered that formerly I had very often had suicidal ideas, that that\nvery night, on the cars, it had seemed to me easy, especially easy\nbecause I thought how it would stupefy her. Now I not only could not\nkill myself, but I could not even think of it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Why do it?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked myself, without answering.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother knock at the door.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes, but I must first know who is knocking. I have time enough.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI put the revolver back on the table, and hid it under my newspaper. I\nwent to the door and drew back the bolt.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was my wife\xe2\x80\x99s sister,\xe2\x80\x94a good and stupid widow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Basile, what does this mean?\xe2\x80\x99 said she, and her tears, always ready,\nbegan to flow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What do you want?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked roughly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw clearly that there was no necessity of being rough with her, but\nI could not speak in any other tone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Basile, she is dying. Ivan Fedorowitch says so.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIvan Fedorowitch was the doctor, _her_ doctor, her counsellor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Is he here?\xe2\x80\x99 I inquired.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd all my hatred of her arose anew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Basile, go to her! Ah! how terrible it is!\xe2\x80\x99 said she.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Go to her?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked myself; and immediately I made answer to myself\nthat I ought to go, that probably that was the thing that is usually\ndone when a husband like myself kills his wife, that it was absolutely\nnecessary that I should go and see her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98If that is the proper thing, I must go,\xe2\x80\x99 I repeated to myself. \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\nif it is necessary, I shall still have time,\xe2\x80\x99 said I to myself,\nthinking of my intention of blowing my brains out.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I followed my sister-in-law. \xe2\x80\x98Now there are going to be phrases\nand grimaces, but I will not yield,\xe2\x80\x99 I declared to myself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Wait,\xe2\x80\x99 said I to my sister-in-law, \xe2\x80\x98it is stupid to be without boots.\nLet me at least put on my slippers.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrange thing! Again, when I had left my study, and was passing\nthrough the familiar rooms, again the hope came to me that nothing had\nhappened. But the odor of the drugs, iodoform and phenic acid, brought\nme back to a sense of reality.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98No, everything has happened.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn passing through the hall, beside the children\xe2\x80\x99s chamber, I saw\nlittle Lise. She was looking at me, with eyes that were full of fear. I\neven thought that all the children were looking at me. As I approached\nthe door of our sleeping-room, a servant opened it from within, and\ncame out. The first thing that I noticed was _her_ light gray dress\nupon a chair, all dark with blood. On our common bed she was stretched,\nwith knees drawn up.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe lay very high, upon pillows, with her chemise half open. Linen had\nbeen placed upon the wound. A heavy smell of iodoform filled the room.\nBefore, and more than anything else, I was astonished at her face,\nwhich was swollen and bruised under the eyes and over a part of the\nnose. This was the result of the blow that I had struck her with my\nelbow, when she had tried to hold me back. Of beauty there was no trace\nleft. I saw something hideous in her. I stopped upon the threshold.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Approach, approach her,\xe2\x80\x99 said her sister.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes, probably she repents,\xe2\x80\x99 thought I; \xe2\x80\x98shall I forgive her? Yes, she\nis dying, I must forgive her,\xe2\x80\x99 I added, trying to be generous.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI approached the bedside. With difficulty she raised her eyes, one of\nwhich was swollen, and uttered these words haltingly:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You have accomplished what you desired. You have killed me.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in her face, through the physical sufferings, in spite of the\napproach of death, was expressed the same old hatred, so familiar to\nme.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The children . . . I will not give them to you . . . all the same. .\n. . She (her sister) shall take them.\xe2\x80\x99 . . .\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut of that which I considered essential, of her fault, of her\ntreason, one would have said that she did not think it necessary to say\neven a word.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes, revel in what you have done.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she sobbed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the door stood her sister with the children.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes, see what you have done!\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cast a glance at the children, and then at her bruised and swollen\nface, and for the first time I forgot myself (my rights, my pride), and\nfor the first time I saw in her a human being, a sister.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd all that which a moment before had been so offensive to me now\nseemed to me so petty,\xe2\x80\x94all this jealousy,\xe2\x80\x94and, on the contrary, what I\nhad done seemed to me so important that I felt like bending over,\napproaching my face to her hand, and saying:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Forgive me!\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I did not dare. She was silent, with eyelids lowered, evidently\nhaving no strength to speak further. Then her deformed face began to\ntremble and shrivel, and she feebly pushed me back.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Why has all this happened? Why?\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Forgive me,\xe2\x80\x99 said I.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes, if you had not killed me,\xe2\x80\x99 she cried suddenly, and her eyes\nshone feverishly. \xe2\x80\x98Forgiveness\xe2\x80\x94that is nothing. . . . If I only do not\ndie! Ah, you have accomplished what you desired! I hate you!\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she grew delirious. She was frightened, and cried:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Fire, I do not fear . . . but strike them all . . . He has gone. . .\n. He has gone.\xe2\x80\x99 . . .\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe delirium continued. She no longer recognized the children, not\neven little Lise, who had approached. Toward noon she died. As for me,\nI was arrested before her death, at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning. They\ntook me to the police station, and then to prison, and there, during\neleven months, awaiting the verdict, I reflected upon myself, and upon\nmy past, and I understood it. Yes, I began to understand from the third\nday. The third day they took me to the house.\xe2\x80\x9d . . .\n\nPosdnicheff seemed to wish to add something, but, no longer having the\nstrength to repress his sobs, he stopped. After a few minutes, having\nrecovered his calmness, he resumed:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI began to understand only when I saw her in the coffin.\xe2\x80\x9d . . .\n\nHe uttered a sob, and then immediately continued, with haste:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen only, when I saw her dead face, did I understand all that I had\ndone. I understood that it was I, I, who had killed her. I understood\nthat I was the cause of the fact that she, who had been a moving,\nliving, palpitating being, had now become motionless and cold, and that\nthere was no way of repairing this thing. He who has not lived through\nthat cannot understand it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nWe remained silent a long time. Posdnicheff sobbed and trembled before\nme. His face had become delicate and long, and his mouth had grown\nlarger.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said he suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cif I had known what I now know, I should\nnever have married her, never, not for anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAgain we remained silent for a long time.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is what I have done, that is my experience, We must\nunderstand the real meaning of the words of the Gospel,\xe2\x80\x94Matthew, v.\n28,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed\nadultery\xe2\x80\x99; and these words relate to the wife, to the sister, and not\nonly to the wife of another, but especially to one\xe2\x80\x99s own wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\nLESSON OF \xe2\x80\x9cTHE KREUTZER SONATA.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nI have received, and still continue to receive, numbers of letters from\npersons who are perfect strangers to me, asking me to state in plain\nand simple language my own views on the subject handled in the story\nentitled \xe2\x80\x9cThe Kreutzer Sonata.\xe2\x80\x9d With this request I shall now endeavor\nto comply.\n\nMy views on the question may be succinctly stated as follows: Without\nentering into details, it will be generally admitted that I am accurate\nin saying that many people condone in young men a course of conduct\nwith regard to the other sex which is incompatible with strict\nmorality, and that this dissoluteness is pardoned generally. Both\nparents and the government, in consequence of this view, may be said to\nwink at profligacy, and even in the last resource to encourage its\npractice. I am of opinion that this is not right.\n\nIt is not possible that the health of one class should necessitate the\nruin of another, and, in consequence, it is our first duty to turn a\ndeaf ear to such an essential immoral doctrine, no matter how strongly\nsociety may have established or law protected it. Moreover, it needs to\nbe fully recognized that men are rightly to be held responsible for the\nconsequences of their own acts, and that these are no longer to be\nvisited on the woman alone. It follows from this that it is the duty of\nmen who do not wish to lead a life of infamy to practice such\ncontinence in respect to all woman as they would were the female\nsociety in which they move made up exclusively of their own mothers and\nsisters.\n\nA more rational mode of life should be adopted which would include\nabstinence from all alcoholic drinks, from excess in eating and from\nflesh meat, on the one hand, and recourse to physical labor on the\nother. I am not speaking of gymnastics, or of any of those occupations\nwhich may be fitly described as playing at work; I mean the genuine\ntoil that fatigues. No one need go far in search of proofs that this\nkind of abstemious living is not merely possible, but far less hurtful\nto health than excess. Hundreds of instances are known to every one.\nThis is my first contention.\n\nIn the second place, I think that of late years, through various\nreasons which I need not enter, but among which the above-mentioned\nlaxity of opinion in society and the frequent idealization of the\nsubject in current literature and painting may be mentioned, conjugal\ninfidelity has become more common and is considered less reprehensible.\nI am of opinion that this is not right. The origin of the evil is\ntwofold. It is due, in the first place, to a natural instinct, and, in\nthe second, to the elevation of this instinct to a place to which it\ndoes not rightly belong. This being so, the evil can only be remedied\nby effecting a change in the views now in vogue about \xe2\x80\x9cfalling in love\xe2\x80\x9d\nand all that this term implies, by educating men and women at home\nthrough family influence and example, and abroad by means of healthy\npublic opinion, to practice that abstinence which morality and\nChristianity alike enjoin. This is my second contention.\n\nIn the third place I am of opinion that another consequence of the\nfalse light in which \xe2\x80\x9cfalling in love,\xe2\x80\x9d and what it leads to, are\nviewed in our society, is that the birth of children has lost its\npristine significance, and that modern marriages are conceived less and\nless from the point of view of the family. I am of opinion that this is\nnot right. This is my third contention.\n\nIn the fourth place, I am of opinion that the children (who in our\nsociety are considered an obstacle to enjoyment\xe2\x80\x94an unlucky accident, as\nit were) are educated not with a view to the problem which they will be\none day called on to face and to solve, but solely with an eye to the\npleasure which they may be made to yield to their parents. The\nconsequence is, that the children of human beings are brought up for\nall the world like the young of animals, the chief care of their\nparents being not to train them to such work as is worthy of men and\nwomen, but to increase their weight, or add a cubit to their stature,\nto make them spruce, sleek, well-fed, and comely. They rig them out in\nall manner of fantastic costumes, wash them, over-feed them, and refuse\nto make them work. If the children of the lower orders differ in this\nlast respect from those of the well-to-do classes, the difference is\nmerely formal; they work from sheer necessity, and not because their\nparents recognize work as a duty. And in over-fed children, as in\nover-fed animals, sensuality is engendered unnaturally early.\n\nFashionable dress to-day, the course of reading, plays, music, dances,\nluscious food, all the elements of our modern life, in a word, from the\npictures on the little boxes of sweetmeats up to the novel, the tale,\nand the poem, contribute to fan this sensuality into a strong,\nconsuming flame, with the result that sexual vices and diseases have\ncome to be the normal conditions of the period of tender youth, and\noften continue into the riper age of full-blown manhood. And I am of\nopinion that this is not right.\n\nIt is high time it ceased. The children of human beings should not be\nbrought up as if they were animals; and we should set up as the object\nand strive to maintain as the result of our labors something better and\nnobler than a well-dressed body. This is my fourth contention.\n\nIn the fifth place, I am of opinion that, owing to the exaggerated and\nerroneous significance attributed by our society to love and to the\nidealized states that accompany and succeed it, the best energies of\nour men and women are drawn forth and exhausted during the most\npromising period of life; those of the men in the work of looking for,\nchoosing, and winning the most desirable objects of love, for which\npurpose lying and fraud are held to be quite excusable; those of the\nwomen and girls in alluring men and decoying them into liaisons or\nmarriage by the most questionable means conceivable, as an instance of\nwhich the present fashions in evening dress may be cited. I am of\nopinion that this is not right.\n\nThe truth is, that the whole affair has been exalted by poets and\nromancers to an undue importance, and that love in its various\ndevelopments is not a fitting object to consume the best energies of\nmen. People set it before them and strive after it, because their view\nof life is as vulgar and brutish as is that other conception frequently\nmet with in the lower stages of development, which sees in luscious and\nabundant food an end worthy of man\xe2\x80\x99s best efforts. Now, this is not\nright and should not be done. And, in order to avoid doing it, it is\nonly needful to realize the fact that whatever truly deserves to be\nheld up as a worthy object of man\xe2\x80\x99s striving and working, whether it be\nthe service of humanity, of one\xe2\x80\x99s country, of science, of art, not to\nspeak of the service of God, is far above and beyond the sphere of\npersonal enjoyment. Hence, it follows that not only to form a liaison,\nbut even to contract marriage, is, from a Christian point of view, not\na progress, but a fall. Love, and all the states that accompany and\nfollow it, however we may try in prose and verse to prove the contrary,\nnever do and never can facilitate the attainment of an aim worthy of\nmen, but always make it more difficult. This is my fifth contention.\n\nHow about the human race? If we admit that celibacy is better and\nnobler than marriage, evidently the human race will come to an end.\nBut, if the logical conclusion of the argument is that the human race\nwill become extinct, the whole reasoning is wrong.\n\nTo that I reply that the argument is not mine; I did not invent it.\nThat it is incumbent on mankind so to strive, and that celibacy is\npreferable to marriage, are truths revealed by Christ 1,900 years ago,\nset forth in our catechisms, and professed by us as followers of\nChrist.\n\nChastity and celibacy, it is urged, cannot constitute the ideal of\nhumanity, because chastity would annihilate the race which strove to\nrealize it, and humanity cannot set up as its ideal its own\nannihilation. It may be pointed out in reply that only that is a true\nideal, which, being unattainable, admits of infinite gradation in\ndegrees of proximity. Such is the Christian ideal of the founding of\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom, the union of all living creatures by the bonds of love.\nThe conception of its attainment is incompatible with the conception of\nthe movement of life. What kind of life could subsist if all living\ncreatures were joined together by the bonds of love? None. Our\nconception of life is inseparably bound up with the conception of a\ncontinual striving after an unattainable ideal.\n\nBut even if we suppose the Christian ideal of perfect chastity\nrealized, what then? We should merely find ourselves face to face on\nthe one hand with the familiar teaching of religion, one of whose\ndogmas is that the world will have an end; and on the other of\nso-called science, which informs us that the sun is gradually losing\nits heat, the result of which will in time be the extinction of the\nhuman race.\n\nNow there is not and cannot be such an institution as Christian\nmarriage, just as there cannot be such a thing as a Christian liturgy\n(Matt. vi. 5-12; John iv. 21), nor Christian teachers, nor church\nfathers (Matt. xxiii. 8-10), nor Christian armies, Christian law\ncourts, nor Christian States. This is what was always taught and\nbelieved by true Christians of the first and following centuries. A\nChristian\xe2\x80\x99s ideal is not marriage, but love for God and for his\nneighbor. Consequently in the eyes of a Christian relations in marriage\nnot only do not constitute a lawful, right, and happy state, as our\nsociety and our churches maintain, but, on the contrary, are always a\nfall.\n\nSuch a thing as Christian marriage never was and never could be. Christ\ndid not marry, nor did he establish marriage; neither did his disciples\nmarry. But if Christian marriage cannot exist, there is such a thing as\na Christian view of marriage. And this is how it may be formulated: A\nChristian (and by this term I understand not those who call themselves\nChristians merely because they were baptized and still receive the\nsacrament once a year, but those whose lives are shaped and regulated\nby the teachings of Christ), I say, cannot view the marriage relation\notherwise than as a deviation from the doctrine of Christ,\xe2\x80\x94as a sin.\nThis is clearly laid down in Matt. v. 28, and the ceremony called\nChristian marriage does not alter its character one jot. A Christian\nwill never, therefore, desire marriage, but will always avoid it.\n\nIf the light of truth dawns upon a Christian when he is already\nmarried, or if, being a Christian, from weakness he enters into marital\nrelations with the ceremonies of the church, or without them, he has no\nother alternative than to abide with his wife (and the wife with her\nhusband, if it is she who is a Christian) and to aspire together with\nher to free themselves of their sin. This is the Christian view of\nmarriage; and there cannot be any other for a man who honestly\nendeavors to shape his life in accordance with the teachings of Christ.\n\nTo very many persons the thoughts I have uttered here and in \xe2\x80\x9cThe\nKreutzer Sonata\xe2\x80\x9d will seem strange, vague, even contradictory. They\ncertainly do contradict, not each other, but the whole tenor of our\nlives, and involuntarily a doubt arises, \xe2\x80\x9con which side is truth,\xe2\x80\x94on\nthe side of the thoughts which seem true and well-founded, or on the\nside of the lives of others and myself?\xe2\x80\x9d I, too, was weighed down by\nthat same doubt when writing \xe2\x80\x9cThe Kreutzer Sonata.\xe2\x80\x9d I had not the\nfaintest presentiment that the train of thought I had started would\nlead me whither it did. I was terrified by my own conclusion, and I was\nat first disposed to reject it, but it was impossible not to hearken to\nthe voice of my reason and my conscience. And so, strange though they\nmay appear to many, opposed as they undoubtedly are to the trend and\ntenor of our lives, and incompatible though they may prove with what I\nhave heretofore thought and uttered, I have no choice but to accept\nthem. \xe2\x80\x9cBut man is weak,\xe2\x80\x9d people will object. \xe2\x80\x9cHis task should be\nregulated by his strength.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis is tantamount to saying, \xe2\x80\x9cMy hand is weak. I cannot draw a\nstraight line,\xe2\x80\x94that is, a line which will be the shortest line between\ntwo given points,\xe2\x80\x94and so, in order to make it more easy for myself, I,\nintending to draw a straight, will choose for my model a crooked line.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe weaker my hand, the greater the need that my model should be\nperfect.\n\n_Leo Tolstoy._\n\n\n\n\nIVAN THE FOOL.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\nIn a certain kingdom there lived a rich peasant, who had three\nsons\xe2\x80\x94Simeon (a soldier), Tarras-Briukhan (fat man), and Ivan (a\nfool)\xe2\x80\x94and one daughter, Milania, born dumb. Simeon went to war, to\nserve the Czar; Tarras went to a city and became a merchant; and Ivan,\nwith his sister, remained at home to work on the farm.\n\nFor his valiant service in the army, Simeon received an estate with\nhigh rank, and married a noble\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. Besides his large pay, he\nwas in receipt of a handsome income from his estate; yet he was unable\nto make ends meet. What the husband saved, the wife wasted in\nextravagance. One day Simeon went to the estate to collect his income,\nwhen the steward informed him that there was no income, saying:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have neither horses, cows, fishing-nets, nor implements; it is\nnecessary first to buy everything, and then to look for income.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSimeon thereupon went to his father and said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are rich, _batiushka_ [little father], but you have given nothing\nto me. Give me one-third of what you possess as my share, and I will\ntransfer it to my estate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old man replied: \xe2\x80\x9cYou did not help to bring prosperity to our\nhousehold. For what reason, then, should you now demand the third part\nof everything? It would be unjust to Ivan and his sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Simeon; \xe2\x80\x9cbut he is a fool, and she was born dumb. What need\nhave they of anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee what Ivan will say.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s reply was: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, let him take his share.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSimeon took the portion allotted to him, and went again to serve in the\narmy.\n\nTarras also met with success. He became rich and married a merchant\xe2\x80\x99s\ndaughter, but even this failed to satisfy his desires, and he also went\nto his father and said, \xe2\x80\x9cGive me my share.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old man, however, refused to comply with his request, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\nhad no hand in the accumulation of our property, and what our household\ncontains is the result of Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s hard work. It would be unjust,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nrepeated, \xe2\x80\x9cto Ivan and his sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTarras replied: \xe2\x80\x9cBut he does not need it. He is a fool, and cannot\nmarry, for no one will have him; and sister does not require anything,\nfor she was born dumb.\xe2\x80\x9d Turning then to Ivan he continued: \xe2\x80\x9cGive me\nhalf the grain you have, and I will not touch the implements or\nfishing-nets; and from the cattle I will take only the dark mare, as\nshe is not fit to plow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan laughed and said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I will go and arrange matters so that\nTarras may have his share,\xe2\x80\x9d whereupon Tarras took the brown mare with\nthe grain to town, leaving Ivan with one old horse to work on as before\nand support his father, mother, and sister.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nIt was disappointing to the _Stary Tchert_ (Old Devil) that the\nbrothers did not quarrel over the division of the property, and that\nthey separated peacefully; and he cried out, calling his three small\ndevils (_Tchertionki_).\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are living three brothers\xe2\x80\x94Simeon the\nsoldier, Tarras-Briukhan, and Ivan the Fool. It is necessary that they\nshould quarrel. Now they live peacefully, and enjoy each other\xe2\x80\x99s\nhospitality. The Fool spoiled all my plans. Now you three go and work\nwith them in such a manner that they will be ready to tear each other\xe2\x80\x99s\neyes out. Can you do this?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can,\xe2\x80\x9d they replied.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow will you accomplish it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn this way: We will first ruin them to such an extent that they will\nhave nothing to eat, and we will then gather them together in one place\nwhere we are sure that they will fight.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; I see you understand your business. Go, and do not return\nto me until you have created a feud between the three brothers\xe2\x80\x94or I\nwill skin you alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe three small devils went to a swamp to consult as to the best means\nof accomplishing their mission. They disputed for a long time\xe2\x80\x94each one\nwanting the easiest part of the work\xe2\x80\x94and not being able to agree,\nconcluded to draw lots; by which it was decided that the one who was\nfirst finished had to come and help the others. This agreement being\nentered into, they appointed a time when they were again to meet in the\nswamp\xe2\x80\x94to find out who was through and who needed assistance.\n\nThe time having arrived, the young devils met in the swamp as agreed,\nwhen each related his experience. The first, who went to Simeon, said:\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have succeeded in my undertaking, and to-morrow Simeon returns to\nhis father.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHis comrades, eager for particulars, inquired how he had done it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9cthe first thing I did was to blow some courage into\nhis veins, and, on the strength of it, Simeon went to the Czar and\noffered to conquer the whole world for him. The Emperor made him\ncommander-in-chief of the forces, and sent him with an army to fight\nthe Viceroy of India. Having started on their mission of conquest, they\nwere unaware that I, following in their wake, had wet all their powder.\nI also went to the Indian ruler and showed him how I could create\nnumberless soldiers from straw.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSimeon\xe2\x80\x99s army, seeing that they were surrounded by such a vast number\nof Indian warriors of my creation, became frightened, and Simeon\ncommanded to fire from cannons and rifles, which of course they were\nunable to do. The soldiers, discouraged, retreated in great disorder.\nThus Simeon brought upon himself the terrible disgrace of defeat. His\nestate was confiscated, and to-morrow he is to be executed. All that\nremains for me to do, therefore,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded the young devil, \xe2\x80\x9cis to\nrelease him to-morrow morning. Now, then, who wants my assistance?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe second small devil (from Tarras) then related his story.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not need any help,\xe2\x80\x9d he began. \xe2\x80\x9cMy business is also all right. My\nwork with Tarras will be finished in one week. In the first place I\nmade him grow thin. He afterward became so covetous that he wanted to\npossess everything he saw, and he spent all the money he had in the\npurchase of immense quantities of goods. When his capital was gone he\nstill continued to buy with borrowed money, and has become involved in\nsuch difficulties that he cannot free himself. At the end of one week\nthe date for the payment of his notes will have expired, and, his goods\nbeing seized upon, he will become a bankrupt; and he also will return\nto his father.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt the conclusion of this narrative they inquired of the third devil\nhow things had fared between him and Ivan.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cmy report is not so encouraging. The first thing I\ndid was to spit into his jug of _quass_ [a sour drink made from rye],\nwhich made him sick at his stomach. He afterward went to plow his\nsummer-fallow, but I made the soil so hard that the plow could scarcely\npenetrate it. I thought the Fool would not succeed, but he started to\nwork nevertheless. Moaning with pain, he still continued to labor. I\nbroke one plow, but he replaced it with another, fixing it securely,\nand resumed work. Going beneath the surface of the ground I took hold\nof the plowshares, but did not succeed in stopping Ivan. He pressed so\nhard, and the colter was so sharp, that my hands were cut; and despite\nmy utmost efforts, he went over all but a small portion of the field.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe concluded with: \xe2\x80\x9cCome, brothers, and help me, for if we do not\nconquer him our whole enterprise will be a failure. If the Fool is\npermitted successfully to conduct his farming, they will have no need,\nfor he will support his brothers.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nIvan having succeeded in plowing all but a small portion of his land,\nhe returned the next day to finish it. The pain in his stomach\ncontinued, but he felt that he must go on with his work. He tried to\nstart his plow, but it would not move; it seemed to have struck a hard\nroot. It was the small devil in the ground who had wound his feet\naround the plowshares and held them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is strange,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Ivan. \xe2\x80\x9cThere were never any roots here\nbefore, and this is surely one.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan put his hand in the ground, and, feeling something soft, grasped\nand pulled it out. It was like a root in appearance, but seemed to\npossess life. Holding it up he saw that it was a little devil.\nDisgusted, he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cSee the nasty thing,\xe2\x80\x9d and he proceeded to\nstrike it a blow, intending to kill it, when the young devil cried out:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not kill me, and I will grant your every wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you do for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me what it is you most wish for,\xe2\x80\x9d the little devil replied.\n\nIvan, peasant-fashion, scratched the back of his head as he thought,\nand finally he said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am dreadfully sick at my stomach. Can you cure me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can,\xe2\x80\x9d the little devil said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe little devil bent toward the earth and began searching for roots,\nand when he found them he gave them to Ivan, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you will\nswallow some of these you will be immediately cured of whatsoever\ndisease you are afflicted with.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan did as directed, and obtained instant relief.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg of you to let me go now,\xe2\x80\x9d the little devil pleaded; \xe2\x80\x9cI will pass\ninto the earth, never to return.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; you may go, and God bless you;\xe2\x80\x9d and as Ivan pronounced the\nname of God, the small devil disappeared into the earth like a flash,\nand only a slight opening in the ground remained.\n\nIvan placed in his hat what roots he had left, and proceeded to plow.\nSoon finishing his work, he turned his plow over and returned home.\n\nWhen he reached the house he found his brother Simeon and his wife\nseated at the supper-table. His estate had been confiscated, and he\nhimself had barely escaped execution by making his way out of prison,\nand having nothing to live upon had come back to his father for\nsupport.\n\nTurning to Ivan he said: \xe2\x80\x9cI came to ask you to care for us until I can\nfind something to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan replied; \xe2\x80\x9cyou may remain with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJust as Ivan was about to sit down to the table Simeon\xe2\x80\x99s wife made a\nwry face, indicating that she did not like the smell of Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s\nsheep-skin coat; and turning to her husband she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall not sit\nat the table with a moujik [peasant] who smells like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSimeon the soldier turned to his brother and said: \xe2\x80\x9cMy lady objects to\nthe smell of your clothes. You may eat in the porch.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan said: \xe2\x80\x9cVery well, it is all the same to me. I will soon have to go\nand feed my horse any way.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan took some bread in one hand, and his _kaftan_ (coat) in the other,\nand left the room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\nThe small devil finished with Simeon that night, and according to\nagreement went to the assistance of his comrade who had charge of Ivan,\nthat he might help to conquer the Fool. He went to the field and\nsearched everywhere, but could find nothing but the hole through which\nthe small devil had disappeared.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, this is strange,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9csomething must have happened to my\ncompanion, and I will have to take his place and continue the work he\nbegan. The Fool is through with his plowing, so I must look about me\nfor some other means of compassing his destruction. I must overflow his\nmeadow and prevent him from cutting the grass.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe little devil accordingly overflowed the meadow with muddy water,\nand, when Ivan went at dawn next morning with his scythe set and\nsharpened and tried to mow the grass, he found that it resisted all his\nefforts and would not yield to the implement as usual.\n\nMany times Ivan tried to cut the grass, but always without success. At\nlast, becoming weary of the effort, he decided to return home and have\nhis scythe again sharpened, and also to procure a quantity of bread,\nsaying: \xe2\x80\x9cI will come back here and will not leave until I have mown all\nthe meadow, even if it should take a whole week.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHearing this, the little devil became thoughtful, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cThat Ivan is\na _koolak_ [hard case], and I must think of some other way of\nconquering him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan soon returned with his sharpened scythe and started to mow.\n\nThe small devil hid himself in the grass, and as the point of the\nscythe came down he buried it in the earth and made it almost\nimpossible for Ivan to move the implement. He, however, succeeded in\nmowing all but one small spot in the swamp, where again the small devil\nhid himself, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cEven if he should cut my hands I will prevent him\nfrom accomplishing his work.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen Ivan came to the swamp he found that the grass was not very thick.\nStill, the scythe would not work, which made him so angry that he\nworked with all his might, and one blow more powerful than the others\ncut off a portion of the small devil\xe2\x80\x99s tail, who had hidden himself\nthere.\n\nDespite the little devil\xe2\x80\x99s efforts he succeeded in finishing his work,\nwhen he returned home and ordered his sister to gather up the grass\nwhile he went to another field to cut rye. But the devil preceded him\nthere, and fixed the rye in such a manner that it was almost impossible\nfor Ivan to cut it; however, after continuous hard labor he succeeded,\nand when he was through with the rye he said to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cNow I will\nstart to mow oats.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOn hearing this, the little devil thought to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cI could not\nprevent him from mowing the rye, but I will surely stop him from mowing\nthe oats when the morning comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEarly next day, when the devil came to the field, he found that the\noats had been already mowed. Ivan did it during the night, so as to\navoid the loss that might have resulted from the grain being too ripe\nand dry. Seeing that Ivan again had escaped him, the little devil\nbecame greatly enraged, saying:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe cut me all over and made me tired, that fool. I did not meet such\nmisfortune even on the battle-field. He does not even sleep;\xe2\x80\x9d and the\ndevil began to swear. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot follow him,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cI will go\nnow to the heaps and make everything rotten.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAccordingly he went to a heap of the new-mown grain and began his\nfiendish work. After wetting it he built a fire and warmed himself, and\nsoon was fast asleep.\n\nIvan harnessed his horse, and, with his sister, went to bring the rye\nhome from the field.\n\nAfter lifting a couple of sheaves from the first heap his pitchfork\ncame into contact with the little devil\xe2\x80\x99s back, which caused the latter\nto howl with pain and to jump around in every direction. Ivan\nexclaimed:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here! What nastiness! You again here?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am another one!\xe2\x80\x9d said the little devil. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was my brother. I am\nthe one who was sent to your brother Simeon.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivan, \xe2\x80\x9cit matters not who you are. I will fix you all the\nsame.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs Ivan was about to strike the first blow the devil pleaded: \xe2\x80\x9cLet me\ngo and I will do you no more harm. I will do whatever you wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you do for me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ivan.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can make soldiers from almost anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what will they be good for?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, they will do everything for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan they sing?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey can.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, make them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake a bunch of straw and scatter it on the ground, and see if each\nstraw will not turn into a soldier.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan shook the straws on the ground, and, as he expected, each straw\nturned into a soldier, and they began marching with a band at their\nhead.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Ishty_ [look you], that was well done! How it will delight the\nvillage maidens!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\n\nThe small devil now said: \xe2\x80\x9cLet me go; you do not need me any longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut Ivan said: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I will not let you go just yet. You have converted\nthe straw into soldiers, and now I want you to turn them again into\nstraw, as I cannot afford to lose it, but I want it with the grain on.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe devil replied: \xe2\x80\x9cSay: \xe2\x80\x98So many soldiers, so much straw.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan did as directed, and got back his rye with the straw.\n\nThe small devil again begged for his release.\n\nIvan, taking him from the pitchfork, said: \xe2\x80\x9cWith God\xe2\x80\x99s blessing you may\ndepart\xe2\x80\x9d; and, as before at the mention of God\xe2\x80\x99s name, the little devil\nwas hurled into the earth like a flash, and nothing was left but the\nhole to show where he had gone.\n\nSoon afterward Ivan returned home, to find his brother Tarras and his\nwife there. Tarras-Briukhan could not pay his debts, and was forced to\nflee from his creditors and seek refuge under his father\xe2\x80\x99s roof. Seeing\nIvan, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Ivan, may we remain here until I start in some\nnew business?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan replied as he had before to Simeon: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, you are perfectly\nwelcome to remain here as long as it suits you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWith that announcement he removed his coat and seated himself at the\nsupper-table with the others. But Tarras-Briukhan\xe2\x80\x99s wife objected to\nthe smell of his clothes, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot eat with a fool; neither\ncan I stand the smell.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThen Tarras-Briukhan said: \xe2\x80\x9cIvan, from your clothes there comes a bad\nsmell; go and eat by yourself in the porch.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivan; and he took some bread and went out as ordered,\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is time for me to feed my mare.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\nThe small devil who had charge of Tarras finished with him that night,\nand according to agreement proceeded to the assistance of the other two\nto help them conquer Ivan. Arriving at the plowed field he looked\naround for his comrades, but found only the hole through which one had\ndisappeared; and on going to the meadow he discovered the severed tail\nof the other, and in the rye-field he found yet another hole.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cit is quite clear that my comrades have met with\nsome great misfortune, and that I will have to take their places and\narrange the feud between the brothers.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe small devil then went in search of Ivan. But he, having finished\nwith the field, was nowhere to be found. He had gone to the forest to\ncut logs to build homes for his brothers, as they found it inconvenient\nfor so many to live under the same roof.\n\nThe small devil at last discovered his whereabouts, and going to the\nforest climbed into the branches of the trees and began to interfere\nwith Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s work. Ivan cut down a tree, which failed, however, to fall\nto the ground, becoming entangled in the branches of other trees; yet\nhe succeeded in getting it down after a hard struggle. In chopping down\nthe next tree he met with the same difficulties, and also with the\nthird. Ivan had supposed he could cut down fifty trees in a day, but he\nsucceeded in chopping but ten before darkness put an end to his labors\nfor a time. He was now exhausted, and, perspiring profusely, he sat\ndown alone in the woods to rest. He soon after resumed his work,\ncutting down one more tree; but the effort gave him a pain in his back,\nand he was obliged to rest again. Seeing this, the small devil was full\nof joy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cnow he is exhausted and will stop work, and I will\nrest also.\xe2\x80\x9d He then seated himself on some branches and rejoiced.\n\nIvan again arose, however, and, taking his axe, gave the tree a\nterrific blow from the opposite side, which felled it instantly to the\nground, carrying the little devil with it; and Ivan, proceeding to cut\nthe branches, found the devil alive. Very much astonished, Ivan\nexclaimed:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook you! Such nastiness! Are you again here?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am another one,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the devil. \xe2\x80\x9cI was with your brother\nTarras.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivan, \xe2\x80\x9cthat makes no difference; I will fix you.\xe2\x80\x9d And he\nwas about to strike him a blow with the axe when the devil pleaded:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not kill me, and whatever you wish you shall have.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can make for you all the money you wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan then told the devil he might proceed, whereupon the latter began\nto explain to him how he might become rich.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to Ivan, \xe2\x80\x9cthe leaves of this oak tree and rub them in\nyour hands, and the gold will fall to the ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan did as he was directed, and immediately the gold began to drop\nabout his feet; and he remarked:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis will be a fine trick to amuse the village boys with.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I now take my departure?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the devil, to which Ivan replied,\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith God\xe2\x80\x99s blessing you may go.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt the mention of the name of God, the devil disappeared into the\nearth.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\nThe brothers, having finished their houses, moved into them and lived\napart from their father and brother. Ivan, when he had completed his\nplowing, made a great feast, to which he invited his brothers, telling\nthem that he had plenty of beer for them to drink. The brothers,\nhowever, declined Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s hospitality, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWe have seen the beer\nmoujiks drink, and want none of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan then gathered around him all the peasants in the village and with\nthem drank beer until he became intoxicated, when he joined the\n_Khorovody_ (a street gathering of the village boys and girls, who sing\nsongs), and told them they must sing his praises, saying that in return\nhe would show them such sights as they had never before seen in their\nlives. The little girls laughed and began to sing songs praising Ivan,\nand when they had finished they said: \xe2\x80\x9cVery well; now give us what you\nsaid you would.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI will soon show you,\xe2\x80\x9d and, taking an empty bag in his\nhand, he started for the woods. The little girls laughed as they said,\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fool he is!\xe2\x80\x9d and resuming their play they forgot all about him.\n\nSome time after Ivan suddenly appeared among them carrying in his hand\nthe bag, which was now filled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I divide this with you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; divide!\xe2\x80\x9d they sang in chorus.\n\nSo Ivan put his hand into the bag and drew it out full of gold coins,\nwhich he scattered among them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBatiushka,\xe2\x80\x9d they cried as they ran to gather up the precious pieces.\n\nThe moujiks then appeared on the scene and began to fight among\nthemselves for the possession of the yellow objects. In the m\xc3\xaal\xc3\xa9e one\nold woman was nearly crushed to death.\n\nIvan laughed and was greatly amused at the sight of so many persons\nquarrelling over a few pieces of gold.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you duratchki\xe2\x80\x9d (little fools), he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy did you almost crush\nthe life out of the old grandmother? Be more gentle. I have plenty\nmore, and I will give them to you;\xe2\x80\x9d whereupon he began throwing about\nmore of the coins.\n\nThe people gathered around him, and Ivan continued throwing until he\nemptied his bag. They clamored for more, but Ivan replied: \xe2\x80\x9cThe gold is\nall gone. Another time I will give you more. Now we will resume our\nsinging and dancing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe little children sang, but Ivan said to them, \xe2\x80\x9cYour songs are no\ngood.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe children said, \xe2\x80\x9cThen show us how to sing better.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTo this Ivan replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI will show you people who can sing better than\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d With that remark Ivan went to the barn and, securing a bundle of\nstraw, did as the little devil had directed him; and presently a\nregiment of soldiers appeared in the village street, and he ordered\nthem to sing and dance.\n\nThe people were astonished and could not understand how Ivan had\nproduced the strangers.\n\nThe soldiers sang for some time, to the great delight of the villagers;\nand when Ivan commanded them to stop they instantly ceased.\n\nIvan then ordered them off to the barn, telling the astonished and\nmystified moujiks that they must not follow him. Reaching the barn, he\nturned the soldiers again into straw and went home to sleep off the\neffects of his debauch.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\nThe next morning Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s exploits were the talk of the village, and news\nof the wonderful things he had done reached the ears of his brother\nSimeon, who immediately went to Ivan to learn all about it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cExplain to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cfrom whence did you bring the soldiers, and\nwhere did you take them?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do you wish to know for?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ivan.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, with soldiers we can do almost anything we wish\xe2\x80\x94whole kingdoms\ncan be conquered,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Simeon.\n\nThis information greatly surprised Ivan, who said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, why did you\nnot tell me about this before? I can make as many as you want.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan then took his brother to the barn, but he said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhile I am\nwilling to create the soldiers, you must take them away from here; for\nif it should become necessary to feed them, all the food in the village\nwould last them only one day.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSimeon promised to do as Ivan wished, whereupon Ivan proceeded to\nconvert the straw into soldiers. Out of one bundle of straw he made an\nentire regiment; in fact, so many soldiers appeared as if by magic that\nthere was not a vacant spot in the field.\n\nTurning to Simeon Ivan said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, is there a sufficient number?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBeaming with joy, Simeon replied: \xe2\x80\x9cEnough! enough! Thank you, Ivan!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlad you are satisfied,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivan, \xe2\x80\x9cand if you wish more I will make\nthem for you. I have plenty of straw now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSimeon divided his soldiers into battalions and regiments, and after\nhaving drilled them he went forth to fight and to conquer.\n\nSimeon had just gotten safely out of the village with his soldiers when\nTarras, the other brother, appeared before Ivan\xe2\x80\x94he also having heard of\nthe previous day\xe2\x80\x99s performance and wanting to learn the secret of his\npower. He sought Ivan, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cTell me the secret of your supply of\ngold, for if I had plenty of money I could with its assistance gather\nin all the wealth in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan was greatly surprised on hearing this statement, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\nmight have told me this before, for I can obtain for you as much money\nas you wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTarras was delighted, and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou might get me about three\nbushels.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivan, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will go to the woods, or, better still, we will\nharness the horse, as we could not possibly carry so much money\nourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe brothers went to the woods and Ivan proceeded to gather the oak\nleaves, which he rubbed between his hands, the dust falling to the\nground and turning into gold pieces as quickly as it fell.\n\nWhen quite a pile had accumulated Ivan turned to Tarras and asked if he\nhad rubbed enough leaves into money, whereupon Tarras replied: \xe2\x80\x9cThank\nyou, Ivan; that will be sufficient for this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan then said: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you wish more, come to me and I will rub as much as\nyou want, for there are plenty of leaves.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTarras, with his _tarantas_ (wagon) filled with gold, rode away to the\ncity to engage in trade and increase his wealth; and thus both brothers\nwent their way, Simeon to fight and Tarras to trade.\n\nSimeon\xe2\x80\x99s soldiers conquered a kingdom for him and Tarras-Briukhan made\nplenty of money.\n\nSome time afterward the two brothers met and confessed to each other\nthe source from whence sprang their prosperity, but they were not yet\nsatisfied.\n\nSimeon said: \xe2\x80\x9cI have conquered a kingdom and enjoy a very pleasant\nlife, but I have not sufficient money to procure food for my soldiers;\xe2\x80\x9d\nwhile Tarras confessed that he was the possessor of enormous wealth,\nbut the care of it caused him much uneasiness.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go again to our brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Simeon; \xe2\x80\x9cI will order him to\nmake more soldiers and will give them to you, and you may then tell him\nthat he must make more money so that we can buy food for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey went again to Ivan, and Simeon said: \xe2\x80\x9cI have not sufficient\nsoldiers; I want you to make me at least two divisions more.\xe2\x80\x9d But Ivan\nshook his head as he said: \xe2\x80\x9cI will not create soldiers for nothing; you\nmust pay me for doing it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but you promised,\xe2\x80\x9d said Simeon.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know I did,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ivan; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have changed my mind since that\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, fool, why will you not do as you promised?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the reason that your soldiers kill men, and I will not make any\nmore for such a cruel purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d With this reply Ivan remained stubborn\nand would not create any more soldiers.\n\nTarras-Briukhan next approached Ivan and ordered him to make more\nmoney; but, as in the case of Tarras, Ivan only shook his head, as he\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cI will not make you any money unless you pay me for doing it. I\ncannot work without pay.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTarras then reminded him of his promise.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know I promised,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ivan; \xe2\x80\x9cbut still I must refuse to do as\nyou wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why, fool, will you not fulfill your promise?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Tarras.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the reason that your gold was the means of depriving Mikhailovna\nof her cow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how did that happen?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Tarras.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt happened in this way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivan. \xe2\x80\x9cMikhailovna always kept a cow,\nand her children had plenty of milk to drink; but some time ago one of\nher boys came to me to beg for some milk, and I asked, \xe2\x80\x98Where is your\ncow?\xe2\x80\x99 when he replied, \xe2\x80\x98A clerk of Tarras-Briukhan came to our home and\noffered three gold pieces for her. Our mother could not resist the\ntemptation, and now we have no milk to drink. I gave you the gold\npieces for your pleasure, and you put them to such poor use that I will\nnot give you any more.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe brothers, on hearing this, took their departure to discuss as to\nthe best plan to pursue in regard to a settlement of their troubles.\n\nSimeon said: \xe2\x80\x9cLet us arrange it in this way: I will give you the half\nof my kingdom, and soldiers to keep guard over your wealth; and you\ngive me money to feed the soldiers in my half of the kingdom.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTo this arrangement Tarras agreed, and both the brothers became rulers\nand very happy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\nIvan remained on the farm and worked to support his father, mother, and\ndumb sister. Once it happened that the old dog, which had grown up on\nthe farm, was taken sick, when Ivan thought he was dying, and, taking\npity on the animal, placed some bread in his hat and carried it to him.\nIt happened that when he turned out the bread the root which the little\ndevil had given him fell out also. The old dog swallowed it with the\nbread and was almost instantly cured, when he jumped up and began to\nwag his tail as an expression of joy. Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s father and mother, seeing\nthe dog cured so quickly, asked by what means he had performed such a\nmiracle.\n\nIvan replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI had some roots which would cure any disease, and the\ndog swallowed one of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt happened about that time that the Czar\xe2\x80\x99s daughter became ill, and\nher father had it announced in every city, town, and village that\nwhosoever would cure her would be richly rewarded; and if the lucky\nperson should prove to be a single man he would give her in marriage to\nhim.\n\nThis announcement, of course, appeared in Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s village.\n\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s father and mother called him and said: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you have any of those\nwonderful roots, go and cure the Czar\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. You will be much\nhappier for having performed such a kind act\xe2\x80\x94indeed, you will be made\nhappy for all your after life.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivan; and he immediately made ready for the journey.\nAs he reached the porch on his way out he saw a poor woman standing\ndirectly in his path and holding a broken arm. The woman accosted him,\nsaying:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was told that you could cure me, and will you not please do so, as I\nam powerless to do anything for myself?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan replied: \xe2\x80\x9cVery well, my poor woman; I will relieve you if I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe produced a root which he handed to the poor woman and told her to\nswallow it.\n\nShe did as Ivan told her and was instantly cured, and went away\nrejoicing that she had recovered the use of her arm.\n\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s father and mother came out to wish him good luck on his journey,\nand to them he told the story of the poor woman, saying that he had\ngiven her his last root. On hearing this his parents were much\ndistressed, as they now believed him to be without the means of curing\nthe Czar\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, and began to scold him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had pity for a beggar and gave no thought to the Czar\xe2\x80\x99s daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d\nthey said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have pity for the Czar\xe2\x80\x99s daughter also,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ivan, after which\nhe harnessed his horse to his wagon and took his seat ready for his\ndeparture; whereupon his parents said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going, you\nfool\xe2\x80\x94to cure the Czar\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, and without anything to do it with?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ivan, as he drove away.\n\nIn due time he arrived at the palace, and the moment he appeared on the\nbalcony the Czar\xe2\x80\x99s daughter was cured. The Czar was overjoyed and\nordered Ivan to be brought into his presence. He dressed him in the\nrichest robes and addressed him as his son-in-law. Ivan was married to\nthe Czarevna, and, the Czar dying soon after, Ivan became ruler. Thus\nthe three brothers became rulers in different kingdoms.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n\nThe brothers lived and reigned. Simeon, the eldest brother, with his\nstraw soldiers took captive the genuine soldiers and trained all alike.\nHe was feared by every one.\n\nTarras-Briukhan, the other brother, did not squander the gold he\nobtained from Ivan, but instead greatly increased his wealth, and at\nthe same time lived well. He kept his money in large trunks, and, while\nhaving more than he knew what to do with, still continued to collect\nmoney from his subjects. The people had to work for the money to pay\nthe taxes which Tarras levied on them, and life was made burdensome to\nthem.\n\nIvan the Fool did not enjoy his wealth and power to the same extent as\ndid his brothers. As soon as his father-in-law, the late Czar, was\nburied, he discarded the Imperial robes which had fallen to him and\ntold his wife to put them away, as he had no further use for them.\nHaving cast aside the insignia of his rank, he once more donned his\npeasant garb and started to work as of old.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI felt lonesome,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand began to grow enormously stout, and\nyet I had no appetite, and neither could I sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan sent for his father, mother, and dumb sister, and brought them to\nlive with him, and they worked with him at whatever he chose to do.\n\nThe people soon learned that Ivan was a fool. His wife one day said to\nhim, \xe2\x80\x9cThe people say you are a fool, Ivan.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let them think so if they wish,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied.\n\nHis wife pondered this reply for some time, and at last decided that if\nIvan was a fool she also was one, and that it would be useless to go\ncontrary to her husband, thinking affectionately of the old proverb\nthat \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the needle goes there goes the thread also.\xe2\x80\x9d She therefore\ncast aside her magnificent robes, and, putting them into the trunk with\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s, dressed herself in cheap clothing and joined her dumb\nsister-in-law, with the intention of learning to work. She succeeded so\nwell that she soon became a great help to Ivan.\n\nSeeing that Ivan was a fool, all the wise men left the kingdom and only\nthe fools remained. They had no money, their wealth consisting only of\nthe products of their labor. But they lived peacefully together,\nsupported themselves in comfort, and had plenty to spare for the needy\nand afflicted.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n\nThe old devil grew tired of waiting for the good news which he expected\nthe little devils to bring him. He waited in vain to hear of the ruin\nof the brothers, so he went in search of the emissaries which he had\nsent to perform that work for him. After looking around for some time,\nand seeing nothing but the three holes in the ground, he decided that\nthey had not succeeded in their work and that he would have to do it\nhimself.\n\nThe old devil next went in search of the brothers, but he could learn\nnothing of their whereabouts. After some time he found them in their\ndifferent kingdoms, contented and happy. This greatly incensed the old\ndevil, and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI will now have to accomplish their mission\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe first visited Simeon the soldier, and appeared before him as a\n_voyevoda_ (general), saying: \xe2\x80\x9cYou, Simeon, are a great warrior, and I\nalso have had considerable experience in warfare, and am desirous of\nserving you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSimeon questioned the disguised devil, and seeing that he was an\nintelligent man took him into his service.\n\nThe new General taught Simeon how to strengthen his army until it\nbecame very powerful. New implements of warfare were introduced.\n\nCannons capable of throwing one hundred balls a minute were also\nconstructed, and these, it was expected, would be of deadly effect in\nbattle.\n\nSimeon, on the advice of his new General, ordered all young men above a\ncertain age to report for drill. On the same advice Simeon established\ngun-shops, where immense numbers of cannons and rifles were made.\n\nThe next move of the new General was to have Simeon declare war against\nthe neighboring kingdom. This he did, and with his immense army marched\ninto the adjoining territory, which he pillaged and burned, destroying\nmore than half the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s soldiers. This so frightened the ruler of\nthat country that he willingly gave up half of his kingdom to save the\nother half.\n\nSimeon, overjoyed at his success, declared his intention of marching\ninto Indian territory and subduing the Viceroy of that country.\n\nBut Simeon\xe2\x80\x99s intentions reached the ears of the Indian ruler, who\nprepared to do battle with him. In addition to having secured all the\nlatest implements of warfare, he added still others of his own\ninvention. He ordered all boys over fourteen and all single women to be\ndrafted into the army, until its proportions became much larger than\nSimeon\xe2\x80\x99s. His cannons and rifles were of the same pattern as Simeon\xe2\x80\x99s,\nand he invented a flying-machine from which bombs could be thrown into\nthe enemy\xe2\x80\x99s camp.\n\nSimeon went forth to conquer the Viceroy with full confidence in his\nown powers to succeed. This time luck forsook him, and instead of being\nthe conqueror he was himself conquered.\n\nThe Indian ruler had so arranged his army that Simeon could not even\nget within shooting distance, while the bombs from the flying-machine\ncarried destruction and terror in their path, completely routing his\narmy, so that Simeon was left alone.\n\nThe Viceroy took possession of his kingdom and Simeon had to fly for\nhis life.\n\nHaving finished with Simeon, the old devil next approached Tarras. He\nappeared before him disguised as one of the merchants of his kingdom,\nand established factories and began to make money. The \xe2\x80\x9cmerchant\xe2\x80\x9d paid\nthe highest price for everything he purchased, and the people ran after\nhim to sell their goods. Through this \xe2\x80\x9cmerchant\xe2\x80\x9d they were enabled to\nmake plenty of money, paying up all their arrears of taxes as well as\nthe others when they came due.\n\nTarras was overjoyed at this condition of affairs and said: \xe2\x80\x9cThanks to\nthis merchant, now I will have more money than before, and life will be\nmuch pleasanter for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe wished to erect new buildings, and advertised for workmen, offering\nthe highest prices for all kinds of labor. Tarras thought the people\nwould be as anxious to work as formerly, but instead he was much\nsurprised to learn that they were working for the \xe2\x80\x9cmerchant.\xe2\x80\x9d Thinking\nto induce them to leave the \xe2\x80\x9cmerchant,\xe2\x80\x9d he increased his offers, but\nthe former, equal to the emergency, also raised the wages of his\nworkmen. Tarras, having plenty of money, increased the offers still\nmore; but the \xe2\x80\x9cmerchant\xe2\x80\x9d raised them still higher and got the better of\nhim. Thus, defeated at every point, Tarras was compelled to abandon the\nidea of building.\n\nTarras next announced that he intended laying out gardens and erecting\nfountains, and the work was to be commenced in the fall, but no one\ncame to offer his services, and again he was obliged to forego his\nintentions. Winter set in, and Tarras wanted some sable fur with which\nto line his great-coat, and he sent his man to procure it for him; but\nthe servant returned without it, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cThere are no sables to be\nhad. The \xe2\x80\x98merchant\xe2\x80\x99 has bought them all, paying a very high price for\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTarras needed horses and sent a messenger to purchase them, but he\nreturned with the same story as on former occasions\xe2\x80\x94that none were to\nbe found, the \xe2\x80\x9cmerchant\xe2\x80\x9d having bought them all to carry water for an\nartificial pond he was constructing. Tarras was at last compelled to\nsuspend business, as he could not find any one willing to work for him.\nThey had all gone over to the \xe2\x80\x9cmerchant\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d side. The only dealings the\npeople had with Tarras were when they went to pay their taxes. His\nmoney accumulated so fast that he could not find a place to put it, and\nhis life became miserable. He abandoned all idea of entering upon the\nnew venture, and only thought of how to exist peaceably. This he found\nit difficult to do, for, turn which way he would, fresh obstacles\nconfronted him. Even his cooks, coachmen, and all his other servants\nforsook him and joined the \xe2\x80\x9cmerchant.\xe2\x80\x9d With all his wealth he had\nnothing to eat, and when he went to market he found the \xe2\x80\x9cmerchant\xe2\x80\x9d had\nbeen there before him and had bought up all the provisions. Still, the\npeople continued to bring him money.\n\nTarras at last became so indignant that he ordered the \xe2\x80\x9cmerchant\xe2\x80\x9d out\nof his kingdom. He left, but settled just outside the boundary line,\nand continued his business with the same result as before, and Tarras\nwas frequently forced to go without food for days. It was rumored that\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cmerchant\xe2\x80\x9d wanted to buy even Tarras himself. On hearing this the\nlatter became very much alarmed and could not decide as to the best\ncourse to pursue.\n\nAbout this time his brother Simeon arrived in the kingdom, and said:\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp me, for I have been defeated and ruined by the Indian Viceroy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTarras replied: \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I help you, when I have had no food myself for\ntwo days?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n\nThe old devil, having finished with the second brother, went to Ivan\nthe Fool. This time he disguised himself as a General, the same as in\nthe case of Simeon, and, appearing before Ivan, said: \xe2\x80\x9cGet an army\ntogether. It is disgraceful for the ruler of a kingdom to be without an\narmy. You call your people to assemble, and I will form them into a\nfine large army.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan took the supposed General\xe2\x80\x99s advice, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you may form\nmy people into an army, but you must also teach them to sing the songs\nI like.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old devil then went through Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom to secure recruits for\nthe army, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cCome, shave your heads [the heads of recruits are\nalways shaved in Russia] and I will give each of you a red hat and\nplenty of vodka\xe2\x80\x9d (whiskey).\n\nAt this the fools only laughed, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe can have all the vodka we\nwant, for we distill it ourselves; and of hats, our little girls make\nall we want, of any color we please, and with handsome fringes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThus was the devil foiled in securing recruits for his army; so he\nreturned to Ivan and said: \xe2\x80\x9cYour fools will not volunteer to be\nsoldiers. It will therefore be necessary to force them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ivan, \xe2\x80\x9cyou may use force if you want to.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old devil then announced that all the fools must become soldiers,\nand those who refused, Ivan would punish with death.\n\nThe fools went to the General; and said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou tell us that Ivan will\npunish with death all those who refuse to become soldiers, but you have\nomitted to state what will be done with us soldiers. We have been told\nthat we are only to be killed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is true,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply.\n\nThe fools on hearing this became stubborn and refused to go.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter kill us now if we cannot avoid death, but we will not become\nsoldiers,\xe2\x80\x9d they declared.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you fools,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old devil, \xe2\x80\x9csoldiers may and may not be\nkilled; but if you disobey Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s orders you will find certain death at\nhis hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe fools remained absorbed in thought for some time and finally went\nto Ivan to question him in regard to the matter.\n\nOn arriving at his house they said: \xe2\x80\x9cA General came to us with an order\nfrom you that we were all to become soldiers, and if we refused you\nwere to punish us with death. Is it true?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan began to laugh heartily on hearing this, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, how I\nalone can punish you with death is something I cannot understand. If I\nwas not a fool myself I would be able to explain it to you, but as it\nis I cannot.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, we will not go,\xe2\x80\x9d they said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ivan, \xe2\x80\x9cyou need not become soldiers unless you\nwish to.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old devil, seeing his schemes about to prove failures, went to the\nruler of Tarakania and became his friend, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cLet us go and\nconquer Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom. He has no money, but he has plenty of cattle,\nprovisions, and various other things that would be useful to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Tarakanian ruler gathered his large army together, and equipping it\nwith cannons and rifles, crossed the boundary line into Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom.\nThe people went to Ivan and said: \xe2\x80\x9cThe ruler of Tarakania is here with\na large army to fight us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet them come,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ivan.\n\nThe Tarakanian ruler, after crossing the line into Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom,\nlooked in vain for soldiers to fight against; and waiting some time and\nnone appearing, he sent his own warriors to attack the villages.\n\nThey soon reached the first village, which they began to plunder.\n\nThe fools of both sexes looked calmly on, offering not the least\nresistance when their cattle and provisions were being taken from them.\nOn the contrary, they invited the soldiers to come and live with them,\nsaying: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you, dear friends, find it is difficult to earn a living in\nyour own land, come and live with us, where everything is plentiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe soldiers decided to remain, finding the people happy and\nprosperous, with enough surplus food to supply many of their neighbors.\nThey were surprised at the cordial greetings which they everywhere\nreceived, and, returning to the ruler of Tarakania, they said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\ncannot fight with these people\xe2\x80\x94take us to another place. We would much\nprefer the dangers of actual warfare to this unsoldierly method of\nsubduing the village.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Tarakanian ruler, becoming enraged, ordered the soldiers to destroy\nthe whole kingdom, plunder the villages, burn the houses and\nprovisions, and slaughter the cattle.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould you disobey my orders,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI will have every one of you\nexecuted.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe soldiers, becoming frightened, started to do as they were ordered,\nbut the fools wept bitterly, offering no resistance, men, women, and\nchildren all joining in the general lamentation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you treat us so cruelly?\xe2\x80\x9d they cried to the invading soldiers.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you wish to destroy everything we have? If you have more need\nof these things than we have, why not take them with you and leave us\nin peace?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe soldiers, becoming saddened with remorse, refused further to pursue\ntheir path of destruction\xe2\x80\x94the entire army scattering in many\ndirections.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\n\nThe old devil, failing to ruin Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom with soldiers,\ntransformed himself into a nobleman, dressed exquisitely, and became\none of Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s subjects, with the intention of compassing the downfall\nof his kingdom\xe2\x80\x94as he had done with that of Tarras.\n\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cnobleman\xe2\x80\x9d said to Ivan: \xe2\x80\x9cI desire to teach you wisdom and to\nrender you other service. I will build you a palace and factories.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivan; \xe2\x80\x9cyou may live with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe next day the \xe2\x80\x9cnobleman\xe2\x80\x9d appeared on the Square with a sack of gold\nin his hand and a plan for building a house, saying to the people: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\nare living like pigs, and I am going to teach you how to live decently.\nYou are to build a house for me according to this plan. I will\nsuperintend the work myself, and will pay you for your services in\ngold,\xe2\x80\x9d showing them at the same time the contents of his sack.\n\nThe fools were amused. They had never before seen any money. Their\nbusiness was conducted entirely by exchange of farm products or by\nhiring themselves out to work by the day in return for whatever they\nmost needed. They therefore glanced at the gold pieces with amazement,\nand said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat nice toys they would be to play with!\xe2\x80\x9d In return for\nthe gold they gave their services and brought the \xe2\x80\x9cnobleman\xe2\x80\x9d the\nproduce of their farms.\n\nThe old devil was overjoyed as he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cNow my enterprise is on a\nfair road and I will be able to ruin the Fool\xe2\x80\x94as I did his brothers.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe fools obtained sufficient gold to distribute among the entire\ncommunity, the women and young girls of the village wearing much of it\nas ornaments, while to the children they gave some pieces to play with\non the streets.\n\nWhen they had secured all they wanted they stopped working and the\n\xe2\x80\x9cnobleman\xe2\x80\x9d did not get his house more than half finished. He had\nneither provisions nor cattle for the year, and ordered the people to\nbring him both. He directed them also to go on with the building of the\npalace and factories. He promised to pay them liberally in gold for\neverything they did. No one responded to his call\xe2\x80\x94only once in awhile a\nlittle boy or girl would call to exchange eggs for his gold.\n\nThus was the \xe2\x80\x9cnobleman\xe2\x80\x9d deserted, and, having nothing to eat, he went\nto the village to procure some provisions for his dinner. He went to\none house and offered gold in return for a chicken, but was refused,\nthe owner saying: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have enough of that already and do not want any\nmore.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe next went to a fish-woman to buy some herring, when she, too,\nrefused to accept his gold in return for fish, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cI do not wish\nit, my dear man; I have no children to whom I can give it to play with.\nI have three pieces which I keep as curiosities only.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe then went to a peasant to buy bread, but he also refused to accept\nthe gold. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no use for it,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cunless you wish to give it\nfor Christ\xe2\x80\x99s sake; then it will be a different matter, and I will tell\nmy _baba_ [old woman] to cut a piece of bread for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old devil was so angry that he ran away from the peasant, spitting\nand cursing as he went.\n\nNot only did the offer to accept in the name of Christ anger him, but\nthe very mention of the name was like the thrust of a knife in his\nthroat.\n\nThe old devil did not succeed in getting any bread, and in his efforts\nto secure other articles of food he met with the same failure. The\npeople had all the gold they wanted and what pieces they had they\nregarded as curiosities. They said to the old devil: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you bring us\nsomething else in exchange for food, or come to ask for Christ\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\nwe will give you all you want.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut the old devil had nothing but gold, and was too lazy to work; and\nbeing unable to accept anything for Christ\xe2\x80\x99s sake, he was greatly\nenraged.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat else do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI will give you gold with which you\ncan buy everything you want, and you need labor no longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut the fools would not accept his gold, nor listen to him. Thus the\nold devil was obliged to go to sleep hungry.\n\nTidings of this condition of affairs soon reached the ears of Ivan. The\npeople went to him and said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall we do? This nobleman appeared\namong us; he is well dressed; he wishes to eat and drink of the best,\nbut is unwilling to work, and does not beg for food for Christ\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\nHe only offers every one gold pieces. At first we gave him everything\nhe wanted, taking the gold pieces in exchange just as curiosities; but\nnow we have enough of them and refuse to accept any more from him. What\nshall we do with him? he may die of hunger!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan heard all they had to say, and told them to employ him as a\nshepherd, taking turns in doing so.\n\nThe old devil saw no other way out of the difficulty and was obliged to\nsubmit.\n\nIt soon came the old devil\xe2\x80\x99s turn to go to Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s house. He went there\nto dinner and found Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s dumb sister preparing the meal. She was\noften cheated by the lazy people, who while they did not work, yet ate\nup all the gruel. But she learned to know the lazy people from the\ncondition of their hands. Those with great welts on their hands she\ninvited first to the table, and those having smooth white hands had to\ntake what was left.\n\nThe old devil took a seat at the table, but the dumb girl, taking his\nhands, looked at them, and seeing them white and clean, and with long\nnails, swore at him and put him from the table.\n\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s wife said to the old devil: \xe2\x80\x9cYou must excuse my sister-in-law;\nshe will not allow any one to sit at the table whose hands have not\nbeen hardened by toil, so you will have to wait until the dinner is\nover and then you can have what is left. With it you must be\nsatisfied.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old devil was very much offended that he was made to eat with\n\xe2\x80\x9cpigs,\xe2\x80\x9d as he expressed it, and complained to Ivan, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cThe\nfoolish law you have in your kingdom, that all persons must work, is\nsurely the invention of fools. People who work for a living are not\nalways forced to labor with their hands. Do you think wise men labor\nso?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan replied: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what do fools know about it? We all work with our\nhands.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd for that reason you are fools,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the devil. \xe2\x80\x9cI can teach\nyou how to use your brains, and you will find such labor more\nbeneficial.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan was surprised at hearing this, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it is perhaps not\nwithout good reason that we are called fools.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not so easy to work with the brain,\xe2\x80\x9d the old devil said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\nwill not give me anything to eat because my hands have not the\nappearance of being toil-hardened, but you must understand that it is\nmuch harder to do brain-work, and sometimes the head feels like\nbursting with the effort it is forced to make.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why do you not select some light work that you can perform with\nyour hands?\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan asked.\n\nThe devil said: \xe2\x80\x9cI torment myself with brain-work because I have pity\nfor you fools, for, if I did not torture myself, people like you would\nremain fools for all eternity. I have exercised my brain a great deal\nduring my life, and now I am able to teach you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan was greatly surprised and said: \xe2\x80\x9cVery well; teach us, so that when\nour hands are tired we can use our heads to replace them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe devil promised to instruct the people, and Ivan announced the fact\nthroughout his kingdom.\n\nThe devil was willing to teach all those who came to him how to use the\nhead instead of the hands, so as to produce more with the former than\nwith the latter.\n\nIn Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom there was a high tower, which was reached by a long,\nnarrow ladder leading up to the balcony, and Ivan told the old devil\nthat from the top of the tower every one could see him.\n\nSo the old devil went up to the balcony and addressed the people.\n\nThe fools came in great crowds to hear what the old devil had to say,\nthinking that he really meant to tell them how to work with the head.\nBut the old devil only told them in words what to do, and did not give\nthem any practical instruction. He said that men working only with\ntheir hands could not make a living. The fools did not understand what\nhe said to them and looked at him in amazement, and then departed for\ntheir daily work.\n\nThe old devil addressed them for two days from the balcony, and at the\nend of that time, feeling hungry, he asked the people to bring him some\nbread. But they only laughed at him and told him if he could work\nbetter with his head than with his hands he could also find bread for\nhimself. He addressed the people for yet another day, and they went to\nhear him from curiosity, but soon left him to return to their work.\n\nIvan asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, did the nobleman work with his head?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet,\xe2\x80\x9d they said; \xe2\x80\x9cso far he has only talked.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOne day, while the old devil was standing on the balcony, he became\nweak, and, falling down, hurt his head against a pole.\n\nSeeing this, one of the fools ran to Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s wife and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe\ngentleman has at last commenced to work with his head.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe ran to the field to tell Ivan, who was much surprised, and said,\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go and see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe turned his horses\xe2\x80\x99 heads in the direction of the tower, where the\nold devil remained weak from hunger and was still suspended from the\npole, with his body swaying back and forth and his head striking the\nlower part of the pole each time it came in contact with it. While Ivan\nwas looking, the old devil started down the steps head-first\xe2\x80\x94as they\nsupposed, to count them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivan, \xe2\x80\x9che told the truth after all\xe2\x80\x94that sometimes from\nthis kind of work the head bursts. This is far worse than welts on the\nhands.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old devil fell to the ground head-foremost. Ivan approached him,\nbut at that instant the ground opened and the devil disappeared,\nleaving only a hole to show where he had gone.\n\nIvan scratched his head and said: \xe2\x80\x9cSee here; such nastiness! This is\nyet another devil. He looks like the father of the little ones.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan still lives, and people flock to his kingdom. His brothers come to\nhim and he feeds them.\n\nTo every one who comes to him and says, \xe2\x80\x9cGive us food,\xe2\x80\x9d he replies:\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; you are welcome. We have plenty of everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThere is only one unchangeable custom observed in Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom: The\nman with toil-hardened hands is always given a seat at the table, while\nthe possessor of soft white hands must be contented with what is left.\n\n\n\n\nA LOST OPPORTUNITY.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen came Peter to Him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin\nagainst me, and I forgive him? till seven times?\xe2\x80\x9d . . . . \xe2\x80\x9cSo likewise\nshall My heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts\nforgive not every one his brother their trespasses.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94ST. MATTHEW\nxviii., 21-35.\n\n\nIn a certain village there lived a peasant by the name of Ivan\nScherbakoff. He was prosperous, strong, and vigorous, and was\nconsidered the hardest worker in the whole village. He had three sons,\nwho supported themselves by their own labor. The eldest was married,\nthe second about to be married, and the youngest took care of the\nhorses and occasionally attended to the plowing.\n\nThe peasant\xe2\x80\x99s wife, Ivanovna, was intelligent and industrious, while\nher daughter-in-law was a simple, quiet soul, but a hard worker.\n\nThere was only one idle person in the household, and that was Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s\nfather, a very old man who for seven years had suffered from asthma,\nand who spent the greater part of his time lying on the brick oven.\n\nIvan had plenty of everything\xe2\x80\x94three horses, with one colt, a cow with\ncalf, and fifteen sheep. The women made the men\xe2\x80\x99s clothes, and in\naddition to performing all the necessary household labor, also worked\nin the field; while the men\xe2\x80\x99s industry was confined altogether to the\nfarm.\n\nWhat was left of the previous year\xe2\x80\x99s supply of provisions was ample for\ntheir needs, and they sold a quantity of oats sufficient to pay their\ntaxes and other expenses.\n\nThus life went smoothly for Ivan.\n\nThe peasant\xe2\x80\x99s next-door neighbor was a son of Gordey Ivanoff, called\n\xe2\x80\x9cGavryl the Lame.\xe2\x80\x9d It once happened that Ivan had a quarrel with him;\nbut while old man Gordey was yet alive, and Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s father was the head\nof the household, the two peasants lived as good neighbors should. If\nthe women of one house required the use of a sieve or pail, they\nborrowed it from the inmates of the other house. The same condition of\naffairs existed between the men. They lived more like one family, the\none dividing his possessions with the other, and perfect harmony\nreigned between the two families.\n\nIf a stray calf or cow invaded the garden of one of the farmers, the\nother willingly drove it away, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cBe careful, neighbor, that your\nstock does not again stray into my garden; we should put a fence up.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn the same way they had no secrets from each other. The doors of their\nhouses and barns had neither bolts nor locks, so sure were they of each\nother\xe2\x80\x99s honesty. Not a shadow of suspicion darkened their daily\nintercourse.\n\nThus lived the old people.\n\nIn time the younger members of the two households started farming. It\nsoon became apparent that they would not get along as peacefully as the\nold people had done, for they began quarrelling without the slightest\nprovocation.\n\nA hen belonging to Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s daughter-in-law commenced laying eggs, which\nthe young woman collected each morning, intending to keep them for the\nEaster holidays. She made daily visits to the barn, where, under an old\nwagon, she was sure to find the precious egg.\n\nOne day the children frightened the hen and she flew over their\nneighbor\xe2\x80\x99s fence and laid her egg in their garden.\n\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s daughter-in-law heard the hen cackling, but said: \xe2\x80\x9cI am very\nbusy just at present, for this is the eve of a holy day, and I must\nclean and arrange this room. I will go for the egg later on.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen evening came, and she had finished her task, she went to the barn,\nand as usual looked under the old wagon, expecting to find an egg. But,\nalas! no egg was visible in the accustomed place.\n\nGreatly disappointed, she returned to the house and inquired of her\nmother-in-law and the other members of the family if they had taken it.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d they said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe know nothing of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTaraska, the youngest brother-in-law, coming in soon after, she also\ninquired of him if he knew anything about the missing egg. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nreplied; \xe2\x80\x9cyour pretty, crested hen laid her egg in our neighbors\xe2\x80\x99\ngarden, and after she had finished cackling she flew back again over\nthe fence.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe young woman, greatly surprised on hearing this, turned and looked\nlong and seriously at the hen, which was sitting with closed eyes\nbeside the rooster in the chimney-corner. She asked the hen where it\nlaid the egg. At the sound of her voice it simply opened and closed its\neyes, but could make no answer.\n\nShe then went to the neighbors\xe2\x80\x99 house, where she was met by an old\nwoman, who said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want, young woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s daughter-in-law replied: \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, _babushka_ [grandmother], my\nhen flew into your yard this morning. Did she not lay an egg there?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe did not see any,\xe2\x80\x9d the old woman replied; \xe2\x80\x9cwe have our own hens\xe2\x80\x94God\nbe praised!\xe2\x80\x94and they have been laying for this long time. We hunt only\nfor the eggs our own hens lay, and have no use for the eggs other\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s hens lay. Another thing I want to tell you, young woman: we do\nnot go into other people\xe2\x80\x99s yards to look for eggs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNow this speech greatly angered the young woman, and she replied in the\nsame spirit in which she had been spoken to, only using much stronger\nlanguage and speaking at greater length.\n\nThe neighbor replied in the same angry manner, and finally the women\nbegan to abuse each other and call vile names. It happened that old\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s wife, on her way to the well for water, heard the dispute, and\njoined the others, taking her daughter-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s part.\n\nGavryl\xe2\x80\x99s housekeeper, hearing the noise, could not resist the\ntemptation to join the rest and to make her voice heard. As soon as she\nappeared on the scene, she, too, began to abuse her neighbor, reminding\nher of many disagreeable things which had happened (and many which had\nnot happened) between them. She became so infuriated during her\ndenunciations that she lost all control of herself, and ran around like\nsome mad creature.\n\nThen all the women began to shout at the same time, each trying to say\ntwo words to another\xe2\x80\x99s one, and using the vilest language in the\nquarreller\xe2\x80\x99s vocabulary.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are such and such,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted one of the women. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a thief, a\n_schlukha_ [a mean, dirty, low creature]; your father-in-law is even\nnow starving, and you have no shame. You beggar, you borrowed my sieve\nand broke it. You made a large hole in it, and did not buy me another.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have our scale-beam,\xe2\x80\x9d cried another woman, \xe2\x80\x9cand must give it back\nto me;\xe2\x80\x9d whereupon she seized the scale-beam and tried to remove it from\nthe shoulders of Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\n\nIn the m\xc3\xaal\xc3\xa9e which followed they upset the pails of water. They tore\nthe covering from each other\xe2\x80\x99s head, and a general fight ensued.\n\nGavryl\xe2\x80\x99s wife had by this time joined in the fracas, and he, crossing\nthe field and seeing the trouble, came to her rescue.\n\nIvan and his son, seeing that their womenfolk were being badly used,\njumped into the midst of the fray, and a fearful fight followed.\n\nIvan was the most powerful peasant in all the country round, and it did\nnot take him long to disperse the crowd, for they flew in all\ndirections. During the progress of the fight Ivan tore out a large\nquantity of Gavryl\xe2\x80\x99s beard.\n\nBy this time a large crowd of peasants had collected, and it was with\nthe greatest difficulty that they persuaded the two families to stop\nquarrelling.\n\nThis was the beginning.\n\nGavryl took the portion of his beard which Ivan had torn out, and,\nwrapping it in a paper, went to the _volostnoye_ (moujiks\xe2\x80\x99 court) and\nentered a complaint against Ivan.\n\nHolding up the hair, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI did not grow this for that bear Ivan\nto tear out!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nGavryl\xe2\x80\x99s wife went round among the neighbors, telling them that they\nmust not repeat what she told them, but that she and her husband were\ngoing to get the best of Ivan, and that he was to be sent to Siberia.\n\nAnd so the quarrelling went on.\n\nThe poor old grandfather, sick with asthma and lying on the brick oven\nall the time, tried from the first to dissuade them from quarrelling,\nand begged of them to live in peace; but they would not listen to his\ngood advice. He said to them: \xe2\x80\x9cYou children are making a great fuss and\nmuch trouble about nothing. I beg of you to stop and think of what a\nlittle thing has caused all this trouble. It has arisen from only one\negg. If our neighbors\xe2\x80\x99 children picked it up, it is all right. God\nbless them! One egg is of but little value, and without it God will\nsupply sufficient for all our needs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s daughter-in-law here interposed and said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut they called us\nvile names.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old grandfather again spoke, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, even if they _did_ call\nyou bad names, it would have been better to return good for evil, and\nby your example show them how to speak better. Such conduct on your\npart would have been best for all concerned.\xe2\x80\x9d He continued: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\nhad a fight, you wicked people. Such things sometimes happen, but it\nwould be better if you went afterward and asked forgiveness and buried\nyour grievances out of sight. Scatter them to the four winds of heaven,\nfor if you do not do so it will be the worse for you in the end.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe younger members of the family, still obstinate, refused to profit\nby the old man\xe2\x80\x99s advice, and declared he was not right, and that he\nonly liked to grumble in his old-fashioned way.\n\nIvan refused to go to his neighbor, as the grandfather wished, saying:\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not tear out Gavryl\xe2\x80\x99s beard. He did it himself, and his son tore\nmy shirt and trousers into shreds.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan entered suit against Gavryl. He first went to the village justice,\nand not getting satisfaction from him he carried his case to the\nvillage court.\n\nWhile the neighbors were wrangling over the affair, each suing the\nother, it happened that a perch-bolt from Gavryl\xe2\x80\x99s wagon was lost; and\nthe women of Gavryl\xe2\x80\x99s household accused Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s son of stealing it.\n\nThey said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe saw him in the night-time pass by our window, on his way\nto where the wagon was standing.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd my _kumushka_ [sponsor],\xe2\x80\x9d said\none of them, \xe2\x80\x9ctold me that Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s son had offered it for sale at the\n_kabak_ [tavern].\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis accusation caused them again to go into court for a settlement of\ntheir grievances.\n\nWhile the heads of the families were trying to have their troubles\nsettled in court, their home quarrels were constant, and frequently\nresulted in hand-to-hand encounters. Even the little children followed\nthe example of their elders and quarrelled incessantly.\n\nThe women, when they met on the riverbank to do the family washing,\ninstead of attending to their work passed the time in abusing each\nother, and not infrequently they came to blows.\n\nAt first the male members of the families were content with accusing\neach other of various crimes, such as stealing and like meannesses. But\nthe trouble in this mild form did not last long.\n\nThey soon resorted to other measures. They began to appropriate one\nanother\xe2\x80\x99s things without asking permission, while various articles\ndisappeared from both houses and could not be found. This was done out\nof revenge.\n\nThis example being set by the men, the women and children also\nfollowed, and life soon became a burden to all who took part in the\nstrife.\n\nIvan Scherbakoff and \xe2\x80\x9cGavryl the Lame\xe2\x80\x9d at last laid their trouble\nbefore the _mir_ (village meeting), in addition to having been in court\nand calling on the justice of the peace. Both of the latter had grown\ntired of them and their incessant wrangling. One time Gavryl would\nsucceed in having Ivan fined, and if he was not able to pay it he would\nbe locked up in the cold dreary prison for days. Then it would be\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s turn to get Gavryl punished in like manner, and the greater the\ninjury the one could do the other the more delight he took in it.\n\nThe success of either in having the other punished only served to\nincrease their rage against each other, until they were like mad dogs\nin their warfare.\n\nIf anything went wrong with one of them he immediately accused his\nadversary of conspiring to ruin him, and sought revenge without\nstopping to inquire into the rights of the case.\n\nWhen the peasants went into court, and had each other fined and\nimprisoned, it did not soften their hearts in the least. They would\nonly taunt one another on such occasions, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind; I will\nrepay you for all this.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis state of affairs lasted for six years.\n\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s father, the sick old man, constantly repeated his good advice.\nHe would try to arouse their conscience by saying: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing,\nmy children? Can you not throw off all these troubles, pay more\nattention to your business, and suppress your anger against your\nneighbors? There is no use in your continuing to live in this way, for\nthe more enraged you become against each other the worse it is for\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAgain was the wise advice of the old man rejected.\n\nAt the beginning of the seventh year of the existence of the feud it\nhappened that a daughter-in-law of Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s was present at a marriage. At\nthe wedding feast she openly accused Gavryl of stealing a horse. Gavryl\nwas intoxicated at the time and was in no mood to stand the insult, so\nin retaliation he struck the woman a terrific blow, which confined her\nto her bed for more than a week. The woman being in delicate health,\nthe worst results were feared.\n\nIvan, glad of a fresh opportunity to harass his neighbor, lodged a\nformal complaint before the district-attorney, hoping to rid himself\nforever of Gavryl by having him sent to Siberia.\n\nOn examining the complaint the district-attorney would not consider it,\nas by that time the injured woman was walking about and as well as\never.\n\nThus again Ivan was disappointed in obtaining his revenge, and, not\nbeing satisfied with the district-attorney\xe2\x80\x99s decision, had the case\ntransferred to the court, where he used all possible means to push his\nsuit. To secure the favor of the _starshina_ (village mayor) he made\nhim a present of half a gallon of sweet vodka; and to the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s\n_pisar_ (secretary) also he gave presents. By this means he succeeded\nin securing a verdict against Gavryl. The sentence was that Gavryl was\nto receive twenty lashes on his bare back, and the punishment was to be\nadministered in the yard which surrounded the court-house.\n\nWhen Ivan heard the sentence read he looked triumphantly at Gavryl to\nsee what effect it would produce on him. Gavryl turned very white on\nhearing that he was to be treated with such indignity, and turning his\nback on the assembly left the room without uttering a word.\n\nIvan followed him out, and as he reached his horse he heard Gavryl\nsaying: \xe2\x80\x9cVery well; my spine will burn from the lashes, but something\nwill burn with greater fierceness in Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s household before long.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan, on hearing these words, instantly returned to the court, and\ngoing up to the judges said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh! just judges, he threatens to burn my\nhouse and all it contains.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA messenger was immediately sent in search of Gavryl, who was soon\nfound and again brought into the presence of the judges.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it true,\xe2\x80\x9d they asked, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you said you would burn Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s house\nand all it contained?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nGavryl replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI did not say anything of the kind. You may give me as\nmany lashes as you please\xe2\x80\x94that is, if you have the power to do so. It\nseems to me that I alone have to suffer for the truth, while he,\xe2\x80\x9d\npointing to Ivan, \xe2\x80\x9cis allowed to do and say what he pleases.\xe2\x80\x9d Gavryl\nwished to say something more, but his lips trembled, and the words\nrefused to come; so in silence he turned his face toward the wall.\n\nThe sight of so much suffering moved even the judges to pity, and,\nbecoming alarmed at Gavryl\xe2\x80\x99s continued silence, they said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe may do\nboth his neighbor and himself some frightful injury.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here, my brothers,\xe2\x80\x9d said one feeble old judge, looking at Ivan and\nGavryl as he spoke, \xe2\x80\x9cI think you had better try to arrange this matter\npeaceably. You, brother Gavryl, did wrong to strike a woman who was in\ndelicate health. It was a lucky thing for you that God had mercy on you\nand that the woman did not die, for if she had I know not what dire\nmisfortune might have overtaken you! It will not do either of you any\ngood to go on living as you are at present. Go, Gavryl, and make\nfriends with Ivan; I am sure he will forgive you, and we will set aside\nthe verdict just given.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe secretary on hearing this said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible to do this on the\npresent case. According to Article 117 this matter has gone too far to\nbe settled peaceably now, as the verdict has been rendered and must be\nenforced.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut the judges would not listen to the secretary, saying to him: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\ntalk altogether too much. You must remember that the first thing is to\nfulfill God\xe2\x80\x99s command to \xe2\x80\x98Love thy neighbor as thyself,\xe2\x80\x99 and all will\nbe well with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThus with kind words the judges tried to reconcile the two peasants.\nTheir words fell on stony ground, however, for Gavryl would not listen\nto them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am fifty years old,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gavryl, \xe2\x80\x9cand have a son married, and never\nfrom my birth has the lash been applied to my back; but now this bear\nIvan has secured a verdict against me which condemns me to receive\ntwenty lashes, and I am forced to bow to this decision and suffer the\nshame of a public beating. Well, he will have cause to remember this.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt this Gavryl\xe2\x80\x99s voice trembled and he stopped speaking, and turning\nhis back on the judges took his departure.\n\nIt was about ten versts\xe2\x80\x99 distance from the court to the homes of the\nneighbors, and this Ivan travelled late. The women had already gone out\nfor the cattle. He unharnessed his horse and put everything in its\nplace, and then went into the _izba_ (room), but found no one there.\n\nThe men had not yet returned from their work in the field and the women\nhad gone to look for the cattle, so that all about the place was quiet.\nGoing into the room, Ivan seated himself on a wooden bench and soon\nbecame lost in thought. He remembered how, when Gavryl first heard the\nsentence which had been passed upon him, he grew very pale, and turned\nhis face to the wall, all the while remaining silent.\n\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s heart ached when he thought of the disgrace which he had been\nthe means of bringing upon Gavryl, and he wondered how he would feel if\nthe same sentence had been passed upon him. His thoughts were\ninterrupted by the coughing of his father, who was lying on the oven.\n\nThe old man, on seeing Ivan, came down off the oven, and slowly\napproaching his son seated himself on the bench beside him, looking at\nhim as though ashamed. He continued to cough as he leaned on the table\nand said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, did they sentence him?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, they sentenced him to receive twenty lashes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ivan.\n\nOn hearing this the old man sorrowfully shook his head, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cThis\nis very bad, Ivan, and what is the meaning of it all? It is indeed very\nbad, but not so bad for Gavryl as for yourself. Well, suppose his\nsentence _is_ carried out, and he gets the twenty lashes, what will it\nbenefit you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will not again strike a woman,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan replied.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it he will not do? He does not do anything worse than what you\nare constantly doing!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis conversation enraged Ivan, and he shouted: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what did he do?\nHe beat a woman nearly to death, and even now he threatens to burn my\nhouse! Must I bow to him for all this?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old man sighed deeply as he said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou, Ivan, are strong and free\nto go wherever you please, while I have been lying for years on the\noven. You think that you know everything and that I do not know\nanything. No! you are still a child, and as such you cannot see that a\nkind of madness controls your actions and blinds your sight. The sins\nof others are ever before you, while you resolutely keep your own\nbehind your back. I know that what Gavryl did was wrong, but if he\nalone should do wrong there would be no evil in the world. Do you think\nthat all the evil in the world is the work of one man alone? No! it\nrequires two persons to work much evil in the world. You see only the\nbad in Gavryl\xe2\x80\x99s character, but you are blind to the evil that is in\nyour own nature. If he alone were bad and you good, then there would be\nno wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old man, after a pause, continued: \xe2\x80\x9cWho tore Gavryl\xe2\x80\x99s beard? Who\ndestroyed his heaps of rye? Who dragged him into court?\xe2\x80\x94and yet you try\nto put all the blame on his shoulders. You are behaving very badly\nyourself, and for that reason you are wrong. I did not act in such a\nmanner, and certainly I never taught you to do so. I lived in peace\nwith Gavryl\xe2\x80\x99s father all the time we were neighbors. We were always the\nbest of friends. If he was without flour his wife would come to me and\nsay, \xe2\x80\x98_Diadia Frol_ [Grandfather], we need flour.\xe2\x80\x99 I would then say:\n\xe2\x80\x98My good woman, go to the warehouse and take as much as you want.\xe2\x80\x99 If\nhe had no one to care for his horses I would say, \xe2\x80\x98Go, _Ivanushka_\n[diminutive of Ivan], and help him to care for them.\xe2\x80\x99 If I required\nanything I would go to him and say, \xe2\x80\x98Grandfather Gordey, I need this or\nthat,\xe2\x80\x99 and he would always reply, \xe2\x80\x98Take just whatever you want.\xe2\x80\x99 By\nthis means we passed an easy and peaceful life. But what is your life\ncompared with it? As the soldiers fought at Plevna, so are you and\nGavryl fighting all the time, only that your battles are far more\ndisgraceful than that fought at Plevna.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old man went on: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you call this living! and what a sin it all\nis! You are a peasant, and the head of the house; therefore, the\nresponsibility of the trouble rests with you. What an example you set\nyour wife and children by constantly quarrelling with your neighbor!\nOnly a short time since your little boy, Taraska, was cursing his aunt\nArina, and his mother only laughed at it, saying, \xe2\x80\x98What a bright child\nhe is!\xe2\x80\x99 Is that right? You are to blame for all this. You should think\nof the salvation of your soul. Is that the way to do it? You say one\nunkind word to me and I will reply with two. You will give me one slap\nin the face, and I will retaliate with two slaps. No, my son; Christ\ndid not teach us foolish people to act in such a way. If any one should\nsay an unkind word to you it is better not to answer at all; but if you\n_do_ reply do it kindly, and his conscience will accuse him, and he\nwill regret his unkindness to you. This is the way Christ taught us to\nlive. He tells us that if a person smite us on the one cheek we should\noffer unto him the other. That is Christ\xe2\x80\x99s command to us, and we should\nfollow it. You should therefore subdue your pride. Am I not right?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan remained silent, but his father\xe2\x80\x99s words had sunk deep into his\nheart.\n\nThe old man coughed and continued: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think Christ thought us\nwicked? Did he not die that we might be saved? Now you think only of\nthis earthly life. Are you better or worse for thinking alone of it?\nAre you better or worse for having begun that Plevna battle? Think of\nyour expense at court and the time lost in going back and forth, and\nwhat have you gained? Your sons have reached manhood, and are able now\nto work for you. You are therefore at liberty to enjoy life and be\nhappy. With the assistance of your children you could reach a high\nstate of prosperity. But now your property instead of increasing is\ngradually growing less, and why? It is the result of your pride. When\nit becomes necessary for you and your boys to go to the field to work,\nyour enemy instead summons you to appear at court or before some kind\nof judicial person. If you do not plow at the proper time and sow at\nthe proper time mother earth will not yield up her products, and you\nand your children will be left destitute. Why did your oats fail this\nyear? When did you sow them? Were you not quarrelling with your\nneighbor instead of attending to your work? You have just now returned\nfrom the town, where you have been the means of having your neighbor\nhumiliated. You have succeeded in getting him sentenced, but in the end\nthe punishment will fall on your own shoulders. Oh! my child, it would\nbe better for you to attend to your work on the farm and train your\nboys to become good farmers and honest men. If any one offend you\nforgive him for Christ\xe2\x80\x99s sake, and then prosperity will smile on your\nwork and a light and happy feeling will fill your heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan still remained silent.\n\nThe old father in a pleading voice continued: \xe2\x80\x9cTake an old man\xe2\x80\x99s\nadvice. Go and harness your horse, drive back to the court, and\nwithdraw all these complaints against your neighbor. To-morrow go to\nhim, offer to make peace in Christ\xe2\x80\x99s name, and invite him to your\nhouse. It will be a holy day (the birth of the Virgin Mary). Get out\nthe samovar and have some vodka, and over both forgive and forget each\nother\xe2\x80\x99s sins, promising not to transgress in the future, and advise\nyour women and children to do the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan heaved a deep sigh but felt easier in his heart, as he thought:\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old man speaks the truth;\xe2\x80\x9d yet he was in doubt as to how he would\nput his father\xe2\x80\x99s advice into practice.\n\nThe old man, surmising his uncertainty, said to Ivan: \xe2\x80\x9cGo, Ivanushka;\ndo not delay. Extinguish the fire in the beginning, before it grows\nlarge, for then it may be impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s father wished to say more to him, but was prevented by the\narrival of the women, who came into the room chattering like so many\nmagpies. They had already heard of Gavryl\xe2\x80\x99s sentence, and of how he\nthreatened to set fire to Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s house. They found out all about it,\nand in telling it to their neighbors added their own versions of the\nstory, with the usual exaggeration. Meeting in the pasture-ground, they\nproceeded to quarrel with Gavryl\xe2\x80\x99s women. They related how the latter\xe2\x80\x99s\ndaughter-in-law had threatened to secure the influence of the manager\nof a certain noble\xe2\x80\x99s estate in behalf of his friend Gavryl; also that\nthe school-teacher was writing a petition to the Czar himself against\nIvan, explaining in detail his theft of the perchbolt and partial\ndestruction of Gavryl\xe2\x80\x99s garden\xe2\x80\x94declaring that half of Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s land was\nto be given to them.\n\nIvan listened calmly to their stories, but his anger was soon aroused\nonce more, when he abandoned his intention of making peace with Gavryl.\n\nAs Ivan was always busy about the household, he did not stop to speak\nto the wrangling women, but immediately left the room, directing his\nsteps toward the barn. Before getting through with his work the sun had\nset and the boys had returned from their plowing. Ivan met them and\nasked about their work, helping them to put things in order and leaving\nthe broken horse-collar aside to be repaired. He intended to perform\nsome other duties, but it became too dark and he was obliged to leave\nthem till the next day. He fed the cattle, however, and opened the gate\nthat Taraska might take his horses to pasture for the night, after\nwhich he closed it again and went into the house for his supper.\n\nBy this time he had forgotten all about Gavryl and what his father had\nsaid to him. Yet, just as he touched the door-knob, he heard sounds of\nquarrelling proceeding from his neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s house.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I want with that devil?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Gavryl to some one. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\ndeserves to be killed!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan stopped and listened for a moment, when he shook his head\nthreateningly and entered the room. When he came in, the apartment was\nalready lighted. His daughter-in-law was working with her loom, while\nthe old woman was preparing the supper. The eldest son was twining\nstrings for his _lapti_ (peasant\xe2\x80\x99s shoes made of strips of bark from\nthe linden-tree). The other son was sitting by the table reading a\nbook. The room presented a pleasant appearance, everything being in\norder and the inmates apparently gay and happy\xe2\x80\x94the only dark shadow\nbeing that cast over the household by Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s trouble with his neighbor.\n\nIvan came in very cross, and, angrily throwing aside a cat which lay\nsleeping on the bench, cursed the women for having misplaced a pail. He\nlooked very sad and serious, and, seating himself in a corner of the\nroom, proceeded to repair the horse-collar. He could not forget Gavryl,\nhowever\xe2\x80\x94the threatening words he had used in the court-room and those\nwhich Ivan had just heard.\n\nPresently Taraska came in, and after having his supper, put on his\nsheepskin coat, and, taking some bread with him, returned to watch over\nhis horses for the night. His eldest brother wished to accompany him,\nbut Ivan himself arose and went with him as far as the porch. The night\nwas dark and cloudy and a strong wind was blowing, which produced a\npeculiar whistling sound that was most unpleasant to the ear. Ivan\nhelped his son to mount his horse, which, followed by a colt, started\noff on a gallop.\n\nIvan stood for a few moments looking around him and listening to the\nclatter of the horse\xe2\x80\x99s hoofs as Taraska rode down the village street.\nHe heard him meet other boys on horseback, who rode quite as well as\nTaraska, and soon all were lost in the darkness.\n\nIvan remained standing by the gate in a gloomy mood, as he was unable\nto banish from his mind the harassing thoughts of Gavryl, which the\nlatter\xe2\x80\x99s menacing words had inspired: \xe2\x80\x9cSomething will burn with greater\nfierceness in Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s household before long.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is so desperate,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Ivan, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he may set fire to my house\nregardless of the danger to his own. At present everything is dry, and\nas the wind is so high he may sneak from the back of his own building,\nstart a fire, and get away unseen by any of us.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe may burn and steal without being found out, and thus go unpunished.\nI wish I could catch him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis thought so worried Ivan that he decided not to return to his\nhouse, but went out and stood on the street-corner.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Ivan to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI will take a walk around the\npremises and examine everything carefully, for who knows what he may be\ntempted to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan moved very cautiously round to the back of his buildings, not\nmaking the slightest noise, and scarcely daring to breathe. Just as he\nreached a corner of the house he looked toward the fence, and it seemed\nto him that he saw something moving, and that it was slowly creeping\ntoward the corner of the house opposite to where he was standing. He\nstepped back quickly and hid himself in the shadow of the building.\nIvan stood and listened, but all was quiet. Not a sound could be heard\nbut the moaning of the wind through the branches of the trees, and the\nrustling of the leaves as it caught them up and whirled them in all\ndirections. So dense was the darkness that it was at first impossible\nfor Ivan to see more than a few feet beyond where he stood.\n\nAfter a time, however, his sight becoming accustomed to the gloom, he\nwas enabled to see for a considerable distance. The plow and his other\nfarming implements stood just where he had placed them. He could see\nalso the opposite corner of the house.\n\nHe looked in every direction, but no one was in sight, and he thought\nto himself that his imagination must have played him some trick,\nleading him to believe that some one was moving when there really was\nno one there.\n\nStill, Ivan was not satisfied, and decided to make a further\nexamination of the premises. As on the previous occasion, he moved so\nvery cautiously that he could not hear even the sound of his own\nfootsteps. He had taken the precaution to remove his shoes, that he\nmight step the more noiselessly. When he reached the corner of the barn\nit again seemed to him that he saw something moving, this time near the\nplow; but it quickly disappeared. By this time Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s heart was beating\nvery fast, and he was standing in a listening attitude when a sudden\nflash of light illumined the spot, and he could distinctly see the\nfigure of a man seated on his haunches with his back turned toward him,\nand in the act of lighting a bunch of straw which he held in his hand!\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s heart began to beat yet faster, and he became terribly excited,\nwalking up and down with rapid strides, but without making a noise.\n\nIvan said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, he cannot get away, for he will be caught in the\nvery act.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan had taken a few more steps when suddenly a bright light flamed up,\nbut not in the same spot in which he had seen the figure of the man\nsitting. Gavryl had lighted the straw, and running to the barn held it\nunder the edge of the roof, which began to burn fiercely; and by the\nlight of the fire he could distinctly see his neighbor standing.\n\nAs an eagle springs at a skylark, so sprang Ivan at Gavryl, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cI\nwill tear you into pieces! You shall not get away from me this time!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut \xe2\x80\x9cGavryl the Lame,\xe2\x80\x9d hearing footsteps, wrenched himself free from\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s grasp and ran like a hare past the buildings.\n\nIvan, now terribly excited, shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall not escape me!\xe2\x80\x9d and\nstarted in pursuit; but just as he reached him and was about to grasp\nthe collar of his coat, Gavryl succeeded in jumping to one side, and\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s coat became entangled in something and he was thrown violently\nto the ground. Jumping quickly to his feet he shouted, \xe2\x80\x9c_Karaool!\nderji!_\xe2\x80\x9d (watch! catch!)\n\nWhile Ivan was regaining his feet Gavryl succeeded in reaching his\nhouse, but Ivan followed so quickly that he caught up with him before\nhe could enter. Just as he was about to grasp him he was struck on the\nhead with some hard substance. He had been hit on the temple as with a\nstone. The blow was struck by Gavryl, who had picked up an oaken stave,\nand with it gave Ivan a terrible blow on the head.\n\nIvan was stunned, and bright sparks danced before his eyes, while he\nswayed from side to side like a drunken man, until finally all became\ndark and he sank to the ground unconscious.\n\nWhen he recovered his senses, Gavryl was nowhere to be seen, but all\naround him was as light as day. Strange sounds proceeded from the\ndirection of his house, and turning his face that way he saw that his\nbarns were on fire. The rear parts of both were already destroyed, and\nthe flames were leaping toward the front. Fire, smoke, and bits of\nburning straw were being rapidly whirled by the high wind over to where\nhis house stood, and he expected every moment to see it burst into\nflames.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this, brother?\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan cried out, as he beat his thighs with his\nhands. \xe2\x80\x9cI should have stopped to snatch the bunch of burning straw,\nand, throwing it on the ground, should have extinguished it with my\nfeet!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan tried to cry out and arouse his people, but his lips refused to\nutter a word. He next tried to run, but he could not move his feet, and\nhis legs seemed to twist themselves around each other. After several\nattempts he succeeded in taking one or two steps, when he again began\nto stagger and gasp for breath. It was some moments before he made\nanother attempt to move, but after considerable exertion he finally\nreached the barn, the rear of which was by this time entirely consumed;\nand the corner of his house had already caught fire. Dense volumes of\nsmoke began to pour out of the room, which made it difficult to\napproach.\n\nA crowd of peasants had by this time gathered, but they found it\nimpossible to save their homes, so they carried everything which they\ncould to a place of safety. The cattle they drove into neighboring\npastures and left some one to care for them.\n\nThe wind carried the sparks from Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s house to Gavryl\xe2\x80\x99s, and it, too,\ntook fire and was consumed. The wind continued to increase with great\nfury, and the flames spread to both sides of the street, until in a\nvery short time more than half the village was burned.\n\nThe members of Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s household had great difficulty in getting out of\nthe burning building, but the neighbors rescued the old man and carried\nhim to a place of safety, while the women escaped in only their\nnight-clothes. Everything was burned, including the cattle and all the\nfarm implements. The women lost their trunks, which were filled with\nquantities of clothing, the accumulation of years. The storehouse and\nall the provisions perished in the flames, not even the chickens being\nsaved.\n\nGavryl, however, more fortunate than Ivan, saved his cattle and a few\nother things.\n\nThe village was burning all night.\n\nIvan stood near his home, gazing sadly at the burning building, and he\nkept constantly repeating to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cI should have taken away the\nbunch of burning straw, and have stamped out the fire with my feet.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut when he saw his home fall in a smouldering heap, in spite of the\nterrible heat he sprang into the midst of it and carried out a charred\nlog. The women seeing him, and fearing that he would lose his life,\ncalled to him to come back, but he would not pay any attention to them\nand went a second time to get a log. Still weak from the terrible blow\nwhich Gavryl had given him, he was overcome by the heat, and fell into\nthe midst of the burning mass. Fortunately, his eldest son saw him\nfall, and rushing into the fire succeeded in getting hold of him and\ncarrying him out of it. Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s hair, beard, and clothing were burned\nentirely off. His hands were also frightfully injured, but he seemed\nindifferent to pain.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrief drove him crazy,\xe2\x80\x9d the people said.\n\nThe fire was growing less, but Ivan still stood where he could see it,\nand kept repeating to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI should have taken,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.\n\nThe morning after the fire the _starosta_ (village elder) sent his son\nto Ivan to tell him that the old man, his father, was dying, and wanted\nto see him to bid him good-bye.\n\nIn his grief Ivan had forgotten all about his father, and could not\nunderstand what was being said to him. In a dazed way he asked: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\nfather? Whom does he want?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe elder\xe2\x80\x99s son again repeated his father\xe2\x80\x99s message to Ivan. \xe2\x80\x9cYour aged\nparent is at our house dying, and he wants to see you and bid you\ngood-bye. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you go now, uncle Ivan?\xe2\x80\x9d the boy said.\n\nFinally Ivan understood, and followed the elder\xe2\x80\x99s son.\n\nWhen Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s father was carried from the oven, he was slightly injured\nby a big bunch of burning straw falling on him just as he reached the\nstreet. To insure his safety he was removed to the elder\xe2\x80\x99s house, which\nstood a considerable distance from his late home, and where it was not\nlikely that the fire would reach it.\n\nWhen Ivan arrived at the elder\xe2\x80\x99s home he found only the latter\xe2\x80\x99s wife\nand children, who were all seated on the brick oven. The old man was\nlying on a bench holding a lighted candle in his hand (a Russian custom\nwhen a person is dying). Hearing a noise, he turned his face toward the\ndoor, and when he saw it was his son he tried to move. He motioned for\nIvan to come nearer, and when he did so he whispered in a trembling\nvoice: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Ivanushka, did I not tell you before what would be the\nresult of this sad affair? Who set the village on fire?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe, he, _batiushka_ [little father]; he did it. I caught him. He\nplaced the bunch of burning straw to the barn in my presence. Instead\nof running after him, I should have snatched the bunch of burning straw\nand throwing it on the ground have stamped it out with my feet; and\nthen there would have been no fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIvan,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, \xe2\x80\x9cdeath is fast approaching me, and remember\nthat you also will have to die. Who did this dreadful thing? Whose is\nthe sin?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan gazed at the noble face of his dying father and was silent. His\nheart was too full for utterance.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the presence of God,\xe2\x80\x9d the old man continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwhose is the sin?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was only now that the truth began to dawn upon Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s mind, and that\nhe realized how foolish he had acted. He sobbed bitterly, and fell on\nhis knees before his father, and, crying like a child, said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear father, forgive me, for Christ\xe2\x80\x99s sake, for I am guilty before\nGod and before you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old man transferred the lighted candle from his right hand to the\nleft, and, raising the former to his forehead, tried to make the sign\nof the cross, but owing to weakness was unable to do so.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlory to Thee, O Lord! Glory to Thee!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed; and turning his\ndim eyes toward his son, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cSee here, Ivanushka! Ivanushka, my\ndear son!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, my dear father?\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old man, \xe2\x80\x9cnow that you have no\nhome?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan cried and said: \xe2\x80\x9cI do not know how we shall live now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old man closed his eyes and made a movement with his lips, as if\ngathering his feeble strength for a final effort. Slowly opening his\neyes, he whispered:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould you live according to God\xe2\x80\x99s commands you will be happy and\nprosperous again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old man was now silent for awhile and then, smiling sadly, he\ncontinued:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here, Ivanushka, keep silent concerning this trouble, and do not\ntell who set the village on fire. Forgive one sin of your neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s,\nand God will forgive two of yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nGrasping the candle with both hands, Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s father heaved a deep sigh,\nand, stretching himself out on his back, yielded up the ghost.\n\n\nIvan for once accepted his father\xe2\x80\x99s advice. He did not betray Gavryl,\nand no one ever learned the origin of the fire.\n\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s heart became more kindly disposed toward his old enemy, feeling\nthat much of the fault in connection with this sad affair rested with\nhimself.\n\nGavryl was greatly surprised that Ivan did not denounce him before all\nthe villagers, and at first he stood in much fear of him, but he soon\nafterward overcame this feeling.\n\nThe two peasants ceased to quarrel, and their families followed their\nexample. While they were building new houses, both families lived\nbeneath the same roof, and when they moved into their respective homes,\nIvan and Gavryl lived on as good terms as their fathers had done before\nthem.\n\nIvan remembered his dying father\xe2\x80\x99s command, and took deeply to heart\nthe evident warning of God that _a fire should be extinguished in the\nbeginning_. If any one wronged him he did not seek revenge, but instead\nmade every effort to settle the matter peaceably. If any one spoke to\nhim unkindly, he did not answer in the same way, but replied softly,\nand tried to persuade the person not to speak evil. He taught the women\nand children of his household to do the same.\n\nIvan Scherbakoff was now a reformed man.\n\nHe lived well and peacefully, and again became prosperous.\n\nLet us, therefore, have peace, live in brotherly love and kindness, and\nwe will be happy.\n\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPOLIKUSHKA;\xe2\x80\x9d\nor, _The Lot of a Wicked Court Servant_.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\nPolikey was a court man\xe2\x80\x94one of the staff of servants belonging to the\ncourt household of a _boyarinia_ (lady of the nobility).\n\nHe held a very insignificant position on the estate, and lived in a\nrather poor, small house with his wife and children.\n\nThe house was built by the deceased nobleman whose widow he still\ncontinued to serve, and may be described as follows: The four walls\nsurrounding the one _izba_ (room) were built of stone, and the interior\nwas ten yards square. A Russian stove stood in the centre, around which\nwas a free passage. Each corner was fenced off as a separate inclosure\nto the extent of several feet, and the one nearest to the door (the\nsmallest of all) was known as \xe2\x80\x9cPolikey\xe2\x80\x99s corner.\xe2\x80\x9d Elsewhere in the room\nstood the bed (with quilt, sheet, and cotton pillows), the cradle (with\na baby lying therein), and the three-legged table, on which the meals\nwere prepared and the family washing was done. At the latter also\nPolikey was at work on the preparation of some materials for use in his\nprofession\xe2\x80\x94that of an amateur veterinary surgeon. A calf, some hens,\nthe family clothes and household utensils, together with seven persons,\nfilled the little home to the utmost of its capacity. It would indeed\nhave been almost impossible for them to move around had it not been for\nthe convenience of the stove, on which some of them slept at night, and\nwhich served as a table in the day-time.\n\nIt seemed hard to realize how so many persons managed to live in such\nclose quarters.\n\nPolikey\xe2\x80\x99s wife, Akulina, did the washing, spun and wove, bleached her\nlinen, cooked and baked, and found time also to quarrel and gossip with\nher neighbors.\n\nThe monthly allowance of food which they received from the noblewoman\xe2\x80\x99s\nhouse was amply sufficient for the whole family, and there was always\nenough meal left to make mash for the cow. Their fuel they got free,\nand likewise the food for the cattle. In addition they were given a\nsmall piece of land on which to raise vegetables. They had a cow, a\ncalf, and a number of chickens to care for.\n\nPolikey was employed in the stables to take care of two stallions, and,\nwhen necessary, to bleed the horses and cattle and clean their hoofs.\n\nIn his treatment of the animals he used syringes, plasters, and various\nother remedies and appliances of his own invention. For these services\nhe received whatever provisions were required by his family, and a\ncertain sum of money\xe2\x80\x94all of which would have been sufficient to enable\nthem to live comfortably and even happily, if their hearts had not been\nfilled with the shadow of a great sorrow.\n\nThis shadow darkened the lives of the entire family.\n\nPolikey, while young, was employed in a horse-breeding establishment in\na neighboring village. The head stableman was a notorious horse-thief,\nknown far and wide as a great rogue, who, for his many misdeeds, was\nfinally exiled to Siberia. Under his instruction Polikey underwent a\ncourse of training, and, being but a boy, was easily induced to perform\nmany evil deeds. He became so expert in the various kinds of wickedness\npracticed by his teacher that, though he many times would gladly have\nabandoned his evil ways, he could not, owing to the great hold these\nearly-formed habits had upon him. His father and mother died when he\nwas but a child, and he had no one to point out to him the paths of\nvirtue.\n\nIn addition to his other numerous shortcomings, Polikey was fond of\nstrong drink. He also had a habit of appropriating other people\xe2\x80\x99s\nproperty, when the opportunity offered of his doing so without being\nseen. Collar-straps, padlocks, perch-bolts, and things even of greater\nvalue belonging to others found their way with remarkable rapidity and\nin great quantities to Polikey\xe2\x80\x99s home. He did not, however, keep such\nthings for his own use, but sold them whenever he could find a\npurchaser. His payment consisted chiefly of whiskey, though sometimes\nhe received cash.\n\nThis sort of employment, as his neighbors said, was both light and\nprofitable; it required neither education nor labor. It had one\ndrawback, however, which was calculated to reconcile his victims to\ntheir losses: Though he could for a time have all his needs supplied\nwithout expending either labor or money, there was always the\npossibility of his methods being discovered; and this result was sure\nto be followed by a long term of imprisonment. This impending danger\nmade life a burden for Polikey and his family.\n\nSuch a setback indeed very nearly happened to Polikey early in his\ncareer. He married while still young, and God gave him much happiness.\nHis wife, who was a shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, was a strong, intelligent,\nhard-working woman. She bore him many children, each of whom was said\nto be better than the preceding one.\n\nPolikey still continued to steal, but once was caught with some small\narticles belonging to others in his possession. Among them was a pair\nof leather reins, the property of another peasant, who beat him\nseverely and reported him to his mistress.\n\nFrom that time on Polikey was an object of suspicion, and he was twice\nagain detected in similar escapades. By this time the people began to\nabuse him, and the clerk of the court threatened to recruit him into\nthe army as a soldier (which is regarded by the peasants as a great\npunishment and disgrace). His noble mistress severely reprimanded him;\nhis wife wept from grief for his downfall, and everything went from bad\nto worse.\n\nPolikey, notwithstanding his weakness, was a good-natured sort of man,\nbut his love of strong drink had so overcome every moral instinct that\nat times he was scarcely responsible for his actions. This habit he\nvainly endeavored to overcome. It often happened that when he returned\nhome intoxicated, his wife, losing all patience, roundly cursed him and\ncruelly beat him. At times he would cry like a child, and bemoan his\nfate, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunate man that I am, what shall I do? _Let my eyes\nburst into pieces_ if I do not forever give up the vile habit! I will\nnot again touch vodka.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn spite of all his promises of reform, but a short period (perhaps a\nmonth) would elapse when Polikey would again mysteriously disappear\nfrom his home and be lost for several days on a spree.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom what source does he get the money he spends so freely?\xe2\x80\x9d the\nneighbors inquired of each other, as they sadly shook their heads.\n\nOne of his most unfortunate exploits in the matter of stealing was in\nconnection with a clock which belonged to the estate of his mistress.\nThe clock stood in the private office of the noblewoman, and was so old\nas to have outlived its usefulness, and was simply kept as an heirloom.\nIt so happened that Polikey went into the office one day when no one\nwas present but himself, and, seeing the old clock, it seemed to\npossess a peculiar fascination for him, and he speedily transferred it\nto his person. He carried it to a town not far from the village, where\nhe very readily found a purchaser.\n\nAs if purposely to secure his punishment, it happened that the\nstorekeeper to whom he sold it proved to be a relative of one of the\ncourt servants, and who, when he visited his friend on the next\nholiday, related all about his purchase of the clock.\n\nAn investigation was immediately instituted, and all the details of\nPolikey\xe2\x80\x99s transaction were brought to light and reported to his noble\nmistress. He was called into her presence, and, when confronted with\nthe story of the theft, broke down and confessed all. He fell on his\nknees before the noblewoman and plead with her for mercy. The\nkind-hearted lady lectured him about God, the salvation of his soul,\nand his future life. She talked to him also about the misery and\ndisgrace he brought upon his family, and altogether so worked upon his\nfeelings that he cried like a child. In conclusion his kind mistress\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cI will forgive you this time on the condition that you promise\nfaithfully to reform, and never again to take what does not belong to\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPolikey, still weeping, replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI will never steal again in all my\nlife, and if I break my promise may the earth open and swallow me up,\nand let my body be burned with red-hot irons!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPolikey returned to his home, and throwing himself on the oven spent\nthe entire day weeping and repeating the promise made to his mistress.\n\nFrom that time on he was not again caught stealing, but his life became\nextremely sad, for he was regarded with suspicion by every one and\npointed to as a thief.\n\nWhen the time came round for securing recruits for the army, all the\npeasants singled out Polikey as the first to be taken. The\nsuperintendent was especially anxious to get rid of him, and went to\nhis mistress to induce her to have him sent away. The kind-hearted and\nmerciful woman, remembering the peasant\xe2\x80\x99s repentance, refused to grant\nthe superintendent\xe2\x80\x99s request, and told him he must take some other man\nin his stead.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nOne evening Polikey was sitting on his bed beside the table, preparing\nsome medicine for the cattle, when suddenly the door was thrown wide\nopen, and Aksiutka, a young girl from the court, rushed in. Almost out\nof breath, she said: \xe2\x80\x9cMy mistress has ordered you, Polikey _Illitch_\n[son of Ilia], to come up to the court at once!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe girl was standing and still breathing heavily from her late\nexertion as she continued: \xe2\x80\x9cEgor Mikhailovitch, the superintendent, has\nbeen to see our lady about having you drafted into the army, and,\nPolikey Illitch, your name was mentioned among others. Our lady has\nsent me to tell you to come up to the court immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs soon as Aksiutka had delivered her message she left the room in the\nsame abrupt manner in which she had entered.\n\nAkulina, without saying a word, got up and brought her husband\xe2\x80\x99s boots\nto him. They were poor, worn-out things which some soldier had given\nhim, and his wife did not glance at him as she handed them to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to change your shirt, Illitch?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, at last.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Polikey.\n\nAkulina did not once look at him all the time he was putting on his\nboots and preparing to go to the court. Perhaps, after all, it was\nbetter that she did not do so. His face was very pale and his lips\ntrembled. He slowly combed his hair and was about to depart without\nsaying a word, when his wife stopped him to arrange the ribbon on his\nshirt, and, after toying a little with his coat, she put his hat on for\nhim and he left the little home.\n\nPolikey\xe2\x80\x99s next-door neighbors were a joiner and his wife. A thin\npartition only separated the two families, and each could hear what the\nother said and did. Soon after Polikey\xe2\x80\x99s departure a woman was heard to\nsay: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Polikey Illitch, so your mistress has sent for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe voice was that of the joiner\xe2\x80\x99s wife on the other side of the\npartition. Akulina and the woman had quarrelled that morning about some\ntrifling thing done by one of Polikey\xe2\x80\x99s children, and it afforded her\nthe greatest pleasure to learn that her neighbor had been summoned into\nthe presence of his noble mistress. She looked upon such a circumstance\nas a bad omen. She continued talking to herself and said: \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps she\nwants to send him to the town to make some purchases for her household.\nI did not suppose she would select such a faithful man as you are to\nperform such a service for her. If it should prove that she _does_ want\nto send you to the next town, just buy me a quarter-pound of tea. Will\nyou, Polikey Illitch?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPoor Akulina, on hearing the joiner\xe2\x80\x99s wife talking so unkindly of her\nhusband, could hardly suppress the tears, and, the tirade continuing,\nshe at last became angry, and wished she could in some way punish her.\n\nForgetting her neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s unkindness, her thoughts soon turned in\nanother direction, and glancing at her sleeping children she said to\nherself that they might soon be orphans and she herself a soldier\xe2\x80\x99s\nwidow. This thought greatly distressed her, and burying her face in her\nhands she seated herself on the bed, where several of her progeny were\nfast asleep. Presently a little voice interrupted her meditations by\ncrying out, \xe2\x80\x9c_Mamushka_ [little mother], you are crushing me,\xe2\x80\x9d and the\nchild pulled her nightdress from under her mother\xe2\x80\x99s arms.\n\nAkulina, with her head still resting on her hands, said: \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it\nwould be better if we all should die. I only seem to have brought you\ninto the world to suffer sorrow and misery.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nUnable longer to control her grief, she burst into violent weeping,\nwhich served to increase the amusement of the joiner\xe2\x80\x99s wife, who had\nnot forgotten the morning\xe2\x80\x99s squabble, and she laughed loudly at her\nneighbor\xe2\x80\x99s woe.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nAbout half an hour had passed when the youngest child began to cry and\nAkulina arose to feed it. She had by this time ceased to weep, and\nafter feeding the infant she again fell into her old position, with her\nface buried in her hands. She was very pale, but this only increased\nher beauty. After a time she raised her head, and staring at the\nburning candle she began to question herself as to why she had married,\nand as to the reason that the Czar required so many soldiers.\n\nPresently she heard steps outside, and knew that her husband was\nreturning. She hurriedly wiped away the last traces of her tears as she\narose to let him pass into the centre of the room.\n\nPolikey made his appearance with a look of triumph on his face, threw\nhis hat on the bed, and hastily removed his coat; but not a word did he\nutter.\n\nAkulina, unable to restrain her impatience, asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what did she\nwant with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPshaw!\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cit is very well known that Polikushka is\nconsidered the worst man in the village; but when it comes to business\nof importance, who is selected then? Why, Polikushka, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat kind of business?\xe2\x80\x9d Akulina timidly inquired.\n\nBut Polikey was in no hurry to answer her question. He lighted his pipe\nwith a very imposing air, and spit several times on the floor before he\nreplied.\n\nStill retaining his pompous manner, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cShe has ordered me to go\nto a certain merchant in the town and collect a considerable sum of\nmoney.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou to collect money?\xe2\x80\x9d questioned Akulina.\n\nPolikey only shook his head and smiled significantly, saying:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You,\xe2\x80\x99 the mistress said to me, \xe2\x80\x98are a man resting under a grave\nsuspicion\xe2\x80\x94a man who is considered unsafe to trust in any capacity; but\nI have faith in you, and will intrust you with this important business\nof mine in preference to any one else.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPolikey related all this in a loud voice, so that his neighbor might\nhear what he had to say.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You promised me to reform,\xe2\x80\x99 my noble mistress said to me, \xe2\x80\x98and I will\nbe the first to show you how much faith I have in your promise. I want\nyou to ride into town, and, going to the principal merchant there,\ncollect a sum of money from him and bring it to me.\xe2\x80\x99 I said to my\nmistress: \xe2\x80\x98Everything you order shall be done. I will only too gladly\nobey your slightest wish.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen my mistress said: \xe2\x80\x98Do you understand, Polikey, that your future\nlot depends upon the faithful performance of this duty I impose upon\nyou?\xe2\x80\x99 I replied: \xe2\x80\x98Yes, I understand everything, and feel that I will\nsucceed in performing acceptably any task which you may impose upon me.\nI have been accused of every kind of evil deed that it is possible to\ncharge a man with, but I have never done anything seriously wrong\nagainst you, your honor.\xe2\x80\x99 In this way I talked to our mistress until I\nsucceeded in convincing her that my repentance was sincere, and she\nbecame greatly softened toward me, saying, \xe2\x80\x98If you are successful I\nwill give you the first place at the court.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how much money are you to collect?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Akulina.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFifteen hundred rubles,\xe2\x80\x9d carelessly answered Polikey.\n\nAkulina sadly shook her head as she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen are you to start?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe ordered me to leave here to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d Polikey replied. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Take any\nhorse you please,\xe2\x80\x99 she said. \xe2\x80\x98Come to the office, and I will see you\nthere and wish you God-speed on your journey.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlory to Thee, O Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d said Akulina, as she arose and made the sign\nof the cross. \xe2\x80\x9cGod, I am sure, will bless you, Illitch,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, in\na whisper, so that the people on the other side of the partition could\nnot hear what she said, all the while holding on to his sleeve.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIllitch,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried at last, excitedly, \xe2\x80\x9cfor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake promise me\nthat you will not touch a drop of vodka. Take an oath before God, and\nkiss the cross, so that I may be sure that you will not break your\npromise!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPolikey replied in most contemptuous tones: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I will dare\nto touch vodka when I shall have such a large sum of money in my care?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAkulina, have a clean shirt ready for the morning,\xe2\x80\x9d were his parting\nwords for the night.\n\nSo Polikey and his wife went to sleep in a happy frame of mind and full\nof bright dreams for the future.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\nVery early the next morning, almost before the stars had hidden\nthemselves from view, there was seen standing before Polikey\xe2\x80\x99s home a\nlow wagon, the same in which the superintendent himself used to ride;\nand harnessed to it was a large-boned, dark-brown mare, called for some\nunknown reason by the name of _Baraban_ (drum). Aniutka, Polikey\xe2\x80\x99s\neldest daughter, in spite of the heavy rain and the cold wind which was\nblowing, stood outside barefooted and held (not without some fear) the\nreins in one hand, while with the other she endeavored to keep her\ngreen and yellow overcoat wound around her body, and also to hold\nPolikey\xe2\x80\x99s sheepskin coat.\n\nIn the house there were the greatest noise and confusion. The morning\nwas still so dark that the little daylight there was failed to\npenetrate through the broken panes of glass, the window being stuffed\nin many places with rags and paper to exclude the cold air.\n\nAkulina ceased from her cooking for a while and helped to get Polikey\nready for the journey. Most of the children were still in bed, very\nlikely as a protection against the cold, for Akulina had taken away the\nbig overcoat which usually covered them and had substituted a shawl of\nher own. Polikey\xe2\x80\x99s shirt was all ready, nice and clean, but his shoes\nbadly needed repairing, and this fact caused his devoted wife much\nanxiety. She took from her own feet the thick woollen stockings she was\nwearing, and gave them to Polikey. She then began to repair his shoes,\npatching up the holes so as to protect his feet from dampness.\n\nWhile this was going on he was sitting on the side of the bed with his\nfeet dangling over the edge, and trying to turn the sash which confined\nhis coat at the waist. He was anxious to look as clean as possible, and\nhe declared his sash looked like a dirty rope.\n\nOne of his daughters, enveloped in a sheepskin coat, was sent to a\nneighbor\xe2\x80\x99s house to borrow a hat.\n\nWithin Polikey\xe2\x80\x99s home the greatest confusion reigned, for the court\nservants were constantly arriving with innumerable small orders which\nthey wished Polikey to execute for them in town. One wanted needles,\nanother tea, another tobacco, and last came the joiner\xe2\x80\x99s wife, who by\nthis time had prepared her samovar, and, anxious to make up the quarrel\nof the previous day, brought the traveller a cup of tea.\n\nNeighbor Nikita refused the loan of the hat, so the old one had to be\npatched up for the occasion. This occupied some time, as there were\nmany holes in it.\n\nFinally Polikey was all ready, and jumping on the wagon started on his\njourney, after first making the sign of the cross.\n\nAt the last moment his little boy, Mishka, ran to the door, begging to\nbe given a short ride; and then his little daughter, Mashka, appeared\non the scene and pleaded that she, too, might have a ride, declaring\nthat she would be quite warm enough without furs.\n\nPolikey stopped the horse on hearing the children, and Akulina placed\nthem in the wagon, together with two others belonging to a neighbor\xe2\x80\x94all\nanxious to have a short ride.\n\nAs Akulina helped the little ones into the wagon she took occasion to\nremind Polikey of the solemn promise he had made her not to touch a\ndrop of vodka during the journey.\n\nPolikey drove the children as far as the blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s place, where he\nlet them out of the wagon, telling them they must return home. He then\narranged his clothing, and, setting his hat firmly on his head, started\nhis horse on a trot.\n\nThe two children, Mishka and Mashka, both barefooted, started running\nat such a rapid pace that a strange dog from another village, seeing\nthem flying over the road, dropped his tail between his legs and ran\nhome squealing.\n\nThe weather was very cold, a sharp cutting wind blowing continuously;\nbut this did not disturb Polikey, whose mind was engrossed with\npleasant thoughts. As he rode through the wintry blasts he kept\nrepeating to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cSo I am the man they wanted to send to Siberia,\nand whom they threatened to enroll as a soldier\xe2\x80\x94the same man whom every\none abused, and said he was lazy, and who was pointed out as a thief\nand given the meanest work on the estate to do! Now I am going to\nreceive a large sum of money, for which my mistress is sending me\nbecause she trusts me. I am also riding in the same wagon that the\nsuperintendent himself uses when he is riding as a representative of\nthe court. I have the same harness, leather horse-collar, reins, and\nall the other gear.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPolikey, filled with pride at thought of the mission with which he had\nbeen intrusted, drew himself up with an air of pride, and, fixing his\nold hat more firmly on his head, buttoned his coat tightly about him\nand urged his horse to greater speed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust to think,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued; \xe2\x80\x9cI shall have in my possession three\nthousand half-rubles [the peasant manner of speaking of money so as to\nmake it appear a larger sum than it really is], and will carry them in\nmy bosom. If I wished to I might run away to Odessa instead of taking\nthe money to my mistress. But no; I will not do that. I will surely\ncarry the money straight to the one who has been kind enough to trust\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen Polikey reached the first _kabak_ (tavern) he found that from long\nhabit the mare was naturally turning her head toward it; but he would\nnot allow her to stop, though money had been given him to purchase both\nfood and drink. Striking the animal a sharp blow with the whip, he\npassed by the tavern. The performance was repeated when he reached the\nnext kabak, which looked very inviting; but he resolutely set his face\nagainst entering, and passed on.\n\nAbout noon he arrived at his destination, and getting down from the\nwagon approached the gate of the merchant\xe2\x80\x99s house where the servants of\nthe court always stopped. Opening it he led the mare through, and\n(after unharnessing her) fed her. This done, he next entered the house\nand had dinner with the merchant\xe2\x80\x99s workingman, and to them he related\nwhat an important mission he had been sent on, making himself very\namusing by the pompous air which he assumed. Dinner over, he carried a\nletter to the merchant which the noblewoman had given him to deliver.\n\nThe merchant, knowing thoroughly the reputation which Polikey bore,\nfelt doubtful of trusting him with so much money, and somewhat\nanxiously inquired if he really had received orders to carry so many\nrubles.\n\nPolikey tried to appear offended at this question, but did not succeed,\nand he only smiled.\n\nThe merchant, after reading the letter a second time and being\nconvinced that all was right, gave Polikey the money, which he put in\nhis bosom for safe-keeping.\n\nOn his way to the house he did not once stop at any of the shops he\npassed. The clothing establishments possessed no attractions for him,\nand after he had safely passed them all he stood for a moment, feeling\nvery pleased that he had been able to withstand temptation, and then\nwent on his way.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have money enough to buy up everything,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I will not do\nso.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe numerous commissions which he had received compelled him to go to\nthe bazaar. There he bought only what had been ordered, but he could\nnot resist the temptation to ask the price of a very handsome\nsheep-skin coat which attracted his attention. The merchant to whom he\nspoke looked at Polikey and smiled, not believing that he had\nsufficient money to purchase such an expensive coat. But Polikey,\npointing to his breast, said that he could buy out the whole shop if he\nwished to. He thereupon ordered the shop-keeper to take his measure. He\ntried the coat on and looked himself over carefully, testing the\nquality and blowing upon the hair to see that none of it came out.\nFinally, heaving a deep sigh, he took it off.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe price is too high,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you could let me have it for\nfifteen rubles\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut the merchant cut him short by snatching the coat from him and\nthrowing it angrily to one side.\n\nPolikey left the bazaar and returned to the merchant\xe2\x80\x99s house in high\nspirits.\n\nAfter supper he went out and fed the mare, and prepared everything for\nthe night. Returning to the house he got up on the stove to rest, and\nwhile there he took out the envelope which contained the money and\nlooked long and earnestly at it. He could not read, but asked one of\nthose present to tell him what the writing on the envelope meant. It\nwas simply the address and the announcement that it contained fifteen\nhundred rubles.\n\nThe envelope was made of common paper and was sealed with dark-brown\nsealing wax. There was one large seal in the centre and four smaller\nones at the corners. Polikey continued to examine it carefully, even\ninserting his finger till he touched the crisp notes. He appeared to\ntake a childish delight in having so much money in his possession.\n\nHaving finished his examination, he put the envelope inside the lining\nof his old battered hat, and placing both under his head he went to\nsleep; but during the night he frequently awoke and always felt to know\nif the money was safe. Each time that he found that it was safe he\nrejoiced at the thought that he, Polikey, abused and regarded by every\none as a thief, was intrusted with the care of such a large sum of\nmoney, and also that he was about to return with it quite as safely as\nthe superintendent himself could have done.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\nBefore dawn the next morning Polikey was up, and after harnessing the\nmare and looking in his hat to see that the money was all right, he\nstarted on his return journey.\n\nMany times on the way Polikey took off his hat to see that the money\nwas safe. Once he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI think that perhaps it would be\nbetter if I should put it in my bosom.\xe2\x80\x9d This would necessitate the\nuntying of his sash, so he decided to keep it still in his hat, or\nuntil he should have made half the journey, when he would be compelled\nto stop to feed his horse and to rest.\n\nHe said to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cThe lining is not sewn in very strongly and the\nenvelope might fall out, so I think I had better not take off my hat\nuntil I reach home.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe money was safe\xe2\x80\x94at least, so it seemed to him\xe2\x80\x94and he began to think\nhow grateful his mistress would be to him, and in his excited\nimagination he saw the five rubles he was so sure of receiving.\n\nOnce more he examined the hat to see that the money was safe, and\nfinding everything all right he put on his hat and pulled it well down\nover his ears, smiling all the while at his own thoughts.\n\nAkulina had carefully sewed all the holes in the hat, but it burst out\nin other places owing to Polikey\xe2\x80\x99s removing it so often.\n\nIn the darkness he did not notice the new rents, and tried to push the\nenvelope further under the lining, and in doing so pushed one corner of\nit through the plush.\n\nThe sun was getting high in the heavens, and Polikey having slept but\nlittle the previous night and feeling its warm rays fell fast asleep,\nafter first pressing his hat more firmly on his head. By this action he\nforced the envelope still further through the plush, and as he rode\nalong his head bobbed up and down.\n\nPolikey did not awake till he arrived near his own house, and his first\nact was to put his hand to his head to learn if his hat was all right.\nFinding that it was in its place, he did not think it necessary to\nexamine it and see that the money was safe. Touching the mare gently\nwith the whip she started into a trot, and as he rode along he arranged\nin his own mind how much he was to receive. With the air of a man\nalready holding a high position at the court, he looked around him with\nan expression of lofty scorn on his face.\n\nAs he neared his house he could see before him the one room which\nconstituted their humble home, and the joiner\xe2\x80\x99s wife next door carrying\nher rolls of linen. He saw also the office of the court and his\nmistress\xe2\x80\x99s house, where he hoped he would be able presently to prove\nthat he was an honest, trustworthy man.\n\nHe reasoned with himself that any person can be abused by lying\ntongues, but when his mistress would see him she would say: \xe2\x80\x9cWell done,\nPolikey; you have shown that you can be honest. Here are three\xe2\x80\x94it may\nbe five\xe2\x80\x94perhaps ten\xe2\x80\x94rubles for you;\xe2\x80\x9d and also she would order tea for\nhim, and might treat him to vodka\xe2\x80\x94who knows?\n\nThe latter thought gave him great pleasure, as he was feeling very\ncold.\n\nSpeaking aloud he said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a happy holy-day we can have with ten\nrubles! Having so much money, I could pay Nikita the four rubles fifty\nkopecks which I owe him, and yet have some left to buy shoes for the\nchildren.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen near the house Polikey began to arrange his clothes, smoothing\ndown his fur collar, re-tying his sash, and stroking his hair. To do\nthe latter he had to take off his hat, and when doing so felt in the\nlining for the envelope. Quicker and quicker he ran his hand around the\nlining, and not finding the money used both hands, first one and then\nthe other. But the envelope was not to be found.\n\nPolikey was by this time greatly distressed, and his face was white\nwith fear as he passed his hand through the crown of his old hat.\nPolikey stopped the mare and began a diligent search through the wagon\nand its contents. Not finding the precious envelope, he felt in all his\npockets\xe2\x80\x94_but the money could not be found!_\n\nWildly clutching at his hair, he exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9c_Batiushka!_ What will I\ndo now? What will become of me?\xe2\x80\x9d At the same time he realized that he\nwas near his neighbors\xe2\x80\x99 house and could be seen by them; so he turned\nthe mare around, and, pulling his hat down securely upon his head, he\nrode quickly back in search of his lost treasure.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\nThe whole day passed without any one in the village of Pokrovski having\nseen anything of Polikey. During the afternoon his mistress inquired\nmany times as to his whereabouts, and sent Aksiutka frequently to\nAkulina, who each time sent back word that Polikey had not yet\nreturned, saying also that perhaps the merchant had kept him, or that\nsomething had happened to the mare.\n\nHis poor wife felt a heavy load upon her heart, and was scarcely able\nto do her housework and put everything in order for the next day (which\nwas to be a holy-day). The children also anxiously awaited their\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s appearance, and, though for different reasons, could hardly\nrestrain their impatience. The noblewoman and Akulina were concerned\nonly in regard to Polikey himself, while the children were interested\nmost in what he would bring them from the town.\n\nThe only news received by the villagers during the day concerning\nPolikey was to the effect that neighboring peasants had seen him\nrunning up and down the road and asking every one he met if he or she\nhad found an envelope.\n\nOne of them had seen him also walking by the side of his tired-out\nhorse. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the man was drunk, and had not fed\nhis horse for two days\xe2\x80\x94the animal looked so exhausted.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nUnable to sleep, and with her heart palpitating at every sound, Akulina\nlay awake all night vainly awaiting Polikey\xe2\x80\x99s return. When the cock\ncrowed the third time she was obliged to get up to attend to the fire.\nDay was just dawning and the church-bells had begun to ring. Soon all\nthe children were also up, but there was still no tidings of the\nmissing husband and father.\n\nIn the morning the chill blasts of winter entered their humble home,\nand on looking out they saw that the houses, fields, and roads were\nthickly covered with snow. The day was clear and cold, as if befitting\nthe holy-day they were about to celebrate. They were able to see a long\ndistance from the house, but no one was in sight.\n\nAkulina was busy baking cakes, and had it not been for the joyous\nshouts of the children she would not have known that Polikey was coming\nup the road, for a few minutes later he came in with a bundle in his\nhand and walked quietly to his corner. Akulina noticed that he was very\npale and that his face bore an expression of suffering\xe2\x80\x94as if he would\nlike to have cried but could not do so. But she did not stop to study\nit, but excitedly inquired: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Illitch, is everything all right\nwith you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe slowly muttered something, but his wife could not understand what he\nsaid.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried out, \xe2\x80\x9chave you been to see our mistress?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPolikey still sat on the bed in his corner, glaring wildly about him,\nand smiling bitterly. He did not reply for a long time, and Akulina\nagain cried:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh? Illitch! Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you answer me? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you speak?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFinally he said: \xe2\x80\x9cAkulina, I delivered the money to our mistress; and\noh, how she thanked me!\xe2\x80\x9d Then he suddenly looked about him, with an\nanxious, startled air, and with a sad smile on his lips. Two things in\nthe room seemed to engross the most of his attention: the baby in the\ncradle, and the rope which was attached to the ladder. Approaching the\ncradle, he began with his thin fingers quickly to untie the knot in the\nrope by which the two were connected. After untying it he stood for a\nfew moments looking silently at the baby.\n\nAkulina did not notice this proceeding, and with her cakes on the board\nwent to place them in a corner.\n\nPolikey quickly hid the rope beneath his coat, and again seated himself\non the bed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it that troubles you, Illitch?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Akulina. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not slept,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\n\nSuddenly a dark shadow crossed the window, and a minute later the girl\nAksiutka quickly entered the room, exclaiming:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe _boyarinia_ commands you, Polikey Illitch, to come to her this\nmoment!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPolikey looked first at Akulina and then at the girl.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis moment!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat more is wanted?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe spoke the last sentence so softly that Akulina became quieted in her\nmind, thinking that perhaps their mistress intended to reward her\nhusband.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay that I will come immediately,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nBut Polikey failed to follow the girl, and went instead to another\nplace.\n\nFrom the porch of his house there was a ladder reaching to the attic.\nArriving at the foot of the ladder Polikey looked around him, and\nseeing no one about, he quickly ascended to the garret.\n\n\nMeanwhile the girl had reached her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s house.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it mean that Polikey does not come?\xe2\x80\x9d said the noblewoman\nimpatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere can he be? Why does he not come at once?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAksiutka flew again to his house and demanded to see Polikey.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe went a long time ago,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Akulina, and looking around with an\nexpression of fear on her face, she added, \xe2\x80\x9cHe may have fallen asleep\nsomewhere on the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAbout this time the joiner\xe2\x80\x99s wife, with hair unkempt and clothes\nbedraggled, went up to the loft to gather the linen which she had\npreviously put there to dry. Suddenly a cry of horror was heard, and\nthe woman, with her eyes closed, and crazed by fear, ran down the\nladder like a cat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIllitch,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9chas hanged himself!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPoor Akulina ran up the ladder before any of the people, who had\ngathered from the surrounding houses, could prevent her. With a loud\nshriek she fell back as if dead, and would surely have been killed had\nnot one of the spectators succeeded in catching her in his arms.\n\nBefore dark the same day a peasant of the village, while returning from\nthe town, found the envelope containing Polikey\xe2\x80\x99s money on the\nroadside, and soon after delivered it to the _boyarinia_.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CANDLE.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe have heard that it hath been said, an eye for an eye and a tooth\nfor a tooth: but I say unto you, That ye resist not evil.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94ST. MATTHEW\nv. 38, 39.\n\n\nIt was in the time of serfdom\xe2\x80\x94many years before Alexander II.\xe2\x80\x99s\nliberation of the sixty million serfs in 1862. In those days the people\nwere ruled by different kinds of lords. There were not a few who,\nremembering God, treated their slaves in a humane manner, and not as\nbeasts of burden, while there were others who were seldom known to\nperform a kind or generous action; but the most barbarous and\ntyrannical of all were those former serfs who arose from the dirt and\nbecame princes.\n\nIt was this latter class who made life literally a burden to those who\nwere unfortunate enough to come under their rule. Many of them had\narisen from the ranks of the peasantry to become superintendents of\nnoblemen\xe2\x80\x99s estates.\n\nThe peasants were obliged to work for their master a certain number of\ndays each week. There was plenty of land and water and the soil was\nrich and fertile, while the meadows and forests were sufficient to\nsupply the needs of both the peasants and their lord.\n\nThere was a certain nobleman who had chosen a superintendent from the\npeasantry on one of his other estates. No sooner had the power to\ngovern been vested in this newly-made official than he began to\npractice the most outrageous cruelties upon the poor serfs who had been\nplaced under his control. Although this man had a wife and two married\ndaughters, and was making so much money that he could have lived\nhappily without transgressing in any way against either God or man, yet\nhe was filled with envy and jealousy and deeply sunk in sin.\n\nMichael Simeonovitch began his persecutions by compelling the peasants\nto perform more days of service on the estate every week than the laws\nobliged them to work. He established a brick-yard, in which he forced\nthe men and women to do excessive labor, selling the bricks for his own\nprofit.\n\nOn one occasion the overworked serfs sent a delegation to Moscow to\ncomplain of their treatment to their lord, but they obtained no\nsatisfaction. When the poor peasants returned disconsolate from the\nnobleman their superintendent determined to have revenge for their\nboldness in going above him for redress, and their life and that of\ntheir fellow-victims became worse than before.\n\nIt happened that among the serfs there were some very treacherous\npeople who would falsely accuse their fellows of wrong-doing and sow\nseeds of discord among the peasantry, whereupon Michael would become\ngreatly enraged, while his poor subjects began to live in fear of their\nlives. When the superintendent passed through the village the people\nwould run and hide themselves as from a wild beast. Seeing thus the\nterror which he had struck to the hearts of the moujiks, Michael\xe2\x80\x99s\ntreatment of them became still more vindictive, so that from over-work\nand ill-usage the lot of the poor serfs was indeed a hard one.\n\nThere was a time when it was possible for the peasants, when driven to\ndespair, to devise means whereby they could rid themselves of an\ninhuman monster such as Simeonovitch, and so these unfortunate people\nbegan to consider whether something could not be done to relieve _them_\nof their intolerable yoke. They would hold little meetings in secret\nplaces to bewail their misery and to confer with one another as to\nwhich would be the best way to act. Now and then the boldest of the\ngathering would rise and address his companions in this strain: \xe2\x80\x9cHow\nmuch longer can we tolerate such a villain to rule over us? Let us make\nan end of it at once, for it were better for us to perish than to\nsuffer. It is surely not a sin to kill such a devil in human form.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt happened once, before the Easter holidays, that one of these\nmeetings was held in the woods, where Michael had sent the serfs to\nmake a clearance for their master. At noon they assembled to eat their\ndinner and to hold a consultation. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy can\xe2\x80\x99t we leave now?\xe2\x80\x9d said one.\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery soon we shall be reduced to nothing. Already we are almost worked\nto death\xe2\x80\x94there being no rest, night or day, either for us or our poor\nwomen. If anything should be done in a way not exactly to please him he\nwill find fault and perhaps flog some of us to death\xe2\x80\x94as was the case\nwith poor Simeon, whom he killed not long ago. Only recently Anisim was\ntortured in irons till he died. We certainly cannot stand this much\nlonger.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said another, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is the use of waiting? Let us act\nat once. Michael will be here this evening, and will be certain to\nabuse us shamefully. Let us, then, thrust him from his horse and with\none blow of an axe give him what he deserves, and thus end our misery.\nWe can then dig a big hole and bury him like a dog, and no one will\nknow what became of him. Now let us come to an agreement\xe2\x80\x94to stand\ntogether as one man and not to betray one another.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe last speaker was Vasili Minayeff, who, if possible, had more cause\nto complain of Michael\xe2\x80\x99s cruelty than any of his fellow-serfs. The\nsuperintendent was in the habit of flogging him severely every week,\nand he took also Vasili\xe2\x80\x99s wife to serve him as cook.\n\nAccordingly, during the evening that followed this meeting in the woods\nMichael arrived on the scene on horseback. He began at once to find\nfault with the manner in which the work had been done, and to complain\nbecause some lime-trees had been cut down.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you not to cut down any lime-trees!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the enraged\nsuperintendent. \xe2\x80\x9cWho did this thing? Tell me at once, or I shall flog\nevery one of you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOn investigation, a peasant named Sidor was pointed out as the guilty\none, and his face was roundly slapped. Michael also severely punished\nVasili, because he had not done sufficient work, after which the master\nrode safely home.\n\nIn the evening the serfs again assembled, and poor Vasili said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\nwhat kind of people _are_ we, anyway? We are only sparrows, and not men\nat all! We agree to stand by each other, but as soon as the time for\naction comes we all run and hide. Once a lot of sparrows conspired\nagainst a hawk, but no sooner did the bird of prey appear than they\nsneaked off in the grass. Selecting one of the choicest sparrows, the\nhawk took it away to eat, after which the others came out crying,\n\xe2\x80\x98Twee-twee!\xe2\x80\x99 and found that one was missing. \xe2\x80\x98Who is killed?\xe2\x80\x99 they\nasked. \xe2\x80\x98Vanka! Well, he deserved it.\xe2\x80\x99 You, my friends, are acting in\njust the same manner. When Michael attacked Sidor you should have stood\nby your promise. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you arise, and with one stroke put an end\nto him and to our misery?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe effect of this speech was to make the peasants more firm in their\ndetermination to kill their superintendent. The latter had already\ngiven orders that they should be ready to plough during the Easter\nholidays, and to sow the field with oats, whereupon the serfs became\nstricken with grief, and gathered in Vasili\xe2\x80\x99s house to hold another\nindignation meeting. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he has really forgotten God,\xe2\x80\x9d they said, \xe2\x80\x9cand\nshall continue to commit such crimes against us, it is truly necessary\nthat we should kill him. If not, let us perish, for it can make no\ndifference to us now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis despairing programme, however, met with considerable opposition\nfrom a peaceably-inclined man named Peter Mikhayeff. \xe2\x80\x9cBrethren,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nhe, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are contemplating a grievous sin. The taking of human life is\na very serious matter. Of course it is easy to end the mortal existence\nof a man, but what will become of the souls of those who commit the\ndeed? If Michael continues to act toward us unjustly God will surely\npunish him. But, my friends, we must have patience.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis pacific utterance only served to intensify the anger of Vasili.\nSaid he: \xe2\x80\x9cPeter is forever repeating the same old story, \xe2\x80\x98It is a sin\nto kill any one.\xe2\x80\x99 Certainly it is sinful to murder; but we should\nconsider the kind of man we are dealing with. We all know it is wrong\nto kill a good man, but even God would take away the life of such a dog\nas he is. It is our duty, if we have any love for mankind, to shoot a\ndog that is mad. It is a sin to let him live. If, therefore, we are to\nsuffer at all, let it be in the interests of the people\xe2\x80\x94and they will\nthank us for it. If we remain quiet any longer a flogging will be our\nonly reward. You are talking nonsense, Mikhayeff. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you think\nof the sin we shall be committing if we work during the Easter\nholidays\xe2\x80\x94for you will refuse to work then yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Peter, \xe2\x80\x9cif they shall send me to plough, I will\ngo. But I shall not be going of my own free will, and God will know\nwhose sin it is, and shall punish the offender accordingly. Yet we must\nnot forget him. Brethren, I am not giving you my own views only. The\nlaw of God is not to return evil for evil; indeed, if you try in this\nway to stamp out wickedness it will come upon you all the stronger. It\nis not difficult for you to kill the man, but his blood will surely\nstain your own soul. You may think you have killed a bad man\xe2\x80\x94that you\nhave gotten rid of evil\xe2\x80\x94but you will soon find out that the seeds of\nstill greater wickedness have been planted within you. If you yield to\nmisfortune it will surely come to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs Peter was not without sympathizers among the peasants, the poor\nserfs were consequently divided into two groups: the followers of\nVasili and those who held the views of Mikhayeff.\n\nOn Easter Sunday no work was done. Toward the evening an elder came to\nthe peasants from the nobleman\xe2\x80\x99s court and said: \xe2\x80\x9cOur superintendent,\nMichael Simeonovitch, orders you to go to-morrow to plough the field\nfor the oats.\xe2\x80\x9d Thus the official went through the village and directed\nthe men to prepare for work the next day\xe2\x80\x94some by the river and others\nby the roadway. The poor people were almost overcome with grief, many\nof them shedding tears, but none dared to disobey the orders of their\nmaster.\n\nOn the morning of Easter Monday, while the church bells were calling\nthe inhabitants to religious services, and while every one else was\nabout to enjoy a holiday, the unfortunate serfs started for the field\nto plough. Michael arose rather late and took a walk about the farm.\nThe domestic servants were through with their work and had dressed\nthemselves for the day, while Michael\xe2\x80\x99s wife and their widowed daughter\n(who was visiting them, as was her custom on holidays) had been to\nchurch and returned. A steaming samovar awaited them, and they began to\ndrink tea with Michael, who, after lighting his pipe, called the elder\nto him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the superintendent, \xe2\x80\x9chave you ordered the moujiks to\nplough to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, I did,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave they all gone to the field?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir; all of them. I directed them myself where to begin.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all very well. You gave the orders, but are they ploughing? Go\nat once and see, and you may tell them that I shall be there after\ndinner. I shall expect to find one and a half acres done for every two\nploughs, and the work must be well done; otherwise they shall be\nseverely punished, notwithstanding the holiday.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear, sir, and obey.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe elder started to go, but Michael called him back. After hesitating\nfor some time, as if he felt very uneasy, he said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, listen to what those scoundrels say about me. Doubtless\nsome of them will curse me, and I want you to report the exact words. I\nknow what villains they are. They don\xe2\x80\x99t find work at all pleasant. They\nwould rather lie down all day and do nothing. They would like to eat\nand drink and make merry on holidays, but they forget that if the\nploughing is not done it will soon be too late. So you go and listen to\nwhat is said, and tell it to me in detail. Go at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear, sir, and obey.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTurning his back and mounting his horse, the elder was soon at the\nfield where the serfs were hard at work.\n\nIt happened that Michael\xe2\x80\x99s wife, a very good-hearted woman, overheard\nthe conversation which her husband had just been holding with the\nelder. Approaching him, she said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good friend, Mishinka [diminutive of Michael], I beg of you to\nconsider the importance and solemnity of this holy-day. Do not sin, for\nChrist\xe2\x80\x99s sake. Let the poor moujiks go home.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMichael laughed, but made no reply to his wife\xe2\x80\x99s humane request.\nFinally he said to her:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve not been whipped for a very long time, and now you have become\nbold enough to interfere in affairs that are not your own.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMishinka,\xe2\x80\x9d she persisted, \xe2\x80\x9cI have had a frightful dream concerning\nyou. You had better let the moujiks go.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cI perceive that you have gained so much flesh of late\nthat you think you would not feel the whip. Lookout!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRudely thrusting his hot pipe against her cheek, Michael chased his\nwife from the room, after which he ordered his dinner. After eating a\nhearty meal consisting of cabbage-soup, roast pig, meat-cake, pastry\nwith milk, jelly, sweet cakes, and vodka, he called his woman cook to\nhim and ordered her to be seated and sing songs, Simeonovitch\naccompanying her on the guitar.\n\nWhile the superintendent was thus enjoying himself to the fullest\nsatisfaction in the musical society of his cook the elder returned,\nand, making a low bow to his superior, proceeded to give the desired\ninformation concerning the serfs.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Michael, \xe2\x80\x9cdid they plough?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the elder; \xe2\x80\x9cthey have accomplished about half the\nfield.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there no fault to be found?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot that I could discover. The work seems to be well done. They are\nevidently afraid of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is the soil?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good. It appears to be quite soft.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Simeonovitch, after a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat did they say about me?\nCursed me, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs the elder hesitated somewhat, Michael commanded him to speak and\ntell him the whole truth. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me all,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cI want to know their\nexact words. If you tell me the truth I shall reward you; but if you\nconceal anything from me you will be punished. See here, Catherine,\npour out a glass of vodka to give him courage!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAfter drinking to the health of his superior, the elder said to\nhimself: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not my fault if they do not praise him. I shall tell\nhim the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d Then turning suddenly to the superintendent he said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey complain, Michael Simeonovitch! They complain bitterly.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what did they say?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Michael. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, one thing they said was, \xe2\x80\x98He does not believe in God.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMichael laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cWho said that?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seemed to be their unanimous opinion. \xe2\x80\x98He has been overcome by the\nEvil One,\xe2\x80\x99 they said.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed the superintendent; \xe2\x80\x9cbut tell me what each of them\nsaid. What did Vasili say?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe elder did not wish to betray his people, but he had a certain\ngrudge against Vasili, and he said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe cursed you more than did any of the others.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what did he say?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is awful to repeat it, sir. Vasili said, \xe2\x80\x98He shall die like a dog,\nhaving no chance to repent!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the villain!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Michael. \xe2\x80\x9cHe would kill me if he were not\nafraid. All right, Vasili; we shall have an accounting with you. And\nTishka\xe2\x80\x94he called me a dog, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder, \xe2\x80\x9cthey all spoke of you in anything but\ncomplimentary terms; but it is mean in me to repeat what they said.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMean or not you must tell me, I say!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome of them declared that your back should be broken.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSimeonovitch appeared to enjoy this immensely, for he laughed outright.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall see whose back will be the first to be broken,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cWas\nthat Tishka\xe2\x80\x99s opinion? While I did not suppose they would say anything\ngood about me, I did not expect such curses and threats. And Peter\nMikhayeff\xe2\x80\x94was that fool cursing me too?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; he did not curse you at all. He appeared to be the only silent one\namong them. Mikhayeff is a very wise moujik, and he surprises me very\nmuch. At his actions all the other peasants seemed amazed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did he do?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did something remarkable. He was diligently ploughing, and as I\napproached him I heard some one singing very sweetly. Looking between\nthe ploughshares, I observed a bright object shining.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what was it? Hurry up!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a small, five-kopeck wax candle, burning brightly, and the wind\nwas unable to blow it out. Peter, wearing a new shirt, sang beautiful\nhymns as he ploughed, and no matter how he handled the implement the\ncandle continued to burn. In my presence he fixed the plough, shaking\nit violently, but the bright little object between the colters remained\nundisturbed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did Mikhayeff say?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said nothing\xe2\x80\x94except when, on seeing me, he gave me the holy-day\nsalutation, after which he went on his way singing and ploughing as\nbefore. I did not say anything to him, but, on approaching the other\nmoujiks, I found that they were laughing and making sport of their\nsilent companion. \xe2\x80\x98It is a great sin to plough on Easter Monday,\xe2\x80\x99 they\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x98You could not get absolution from your sin if you were to pray\nall your life.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did Mikhayeff make no reply?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe stood long enough to say: \xe2\x80\x98There should be peace on earth and\ngood-will to men,\xe2\x80\x99 after which he resumed his ploughing and singing,\nthe candle burning even more brightly than before.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSimeonovitch had now ceased to ridicule, and, putting aside his guitar,\nhis head dropped on his breast and he became lost in thought. Presently\nhe ordered the elder and cook to depart, after which Michael went\nbehind a screen and threw himself upon the bed. He was sighing and\nmoaning, as if in great distress, when his wife came in and spoke\nkindly to him. He refused to listen to her, exclaiming:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has conquered me, and my end is near!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMishinka,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, \xe2\x80\x9carise and go to the moujiks in the field.\nLet them go home, and everything will be all right. Heretofore you have\nrun far greater risks without any fear, but now you appear to be very\nmuch alarmed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has conquered me!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cI am lost!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded his wife, angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you will go and do\nas I tell you there will be no danger. Come, Mishinka,\xe2\x80\x9d she added,\ntenderly; \xe2\x80\x9cI shall have the saddle-horse brought for you at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen the horse arrived the woman persuaded her husband to mount the\nanimal, and to fulfil her request concerning the serfs. When he reached\nthe village a woman opened the gate for him to enter, and as he did so\nthe inhabitants, seeing the brutal superintendent whom everybody\nfeared, ran to hide themselves in their houses, gardens, and other\nsecluded places.\n\nAt length Michael reached the other gate, which he found closed also,\nand, being unable to open it himself while seated on his horse, he\ncalled loudly for assistance. As no one responded to his shouts he\ndismounted and opened the gate, but as he was about to remount, and had\none foot in the stirrup, the horse became frightened at some pigs and\nsprang suddenly to one side. The superintendent fell across the fence\nand a very sharp picket pierced his stomach, when Michael fell\nunconscious to the ground.\n\nToward the evening, when the serfs arrived at the village gate, their\nhorses refused to enter. On looking around, the peasants discovered the\ndead body of their superintendent lying face downward in a pool of\nblood, where he had fallen from the fence. Peter Mikhayeff alone had\nsufficient courage to dismount and approach the prostrate form, his\ncompanions riding around the village and entering by way of the back\nyards. Peter closed the dead man\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, after which he put the body in\na wagon and took it home.\n\nWhen the nobleman learned of the fatal accident which had befallen his\nsuperintendent, and of the brutal treatment which he had meted out to\nthose under him, he freed the serfs, exacting a small rent for the use\nof his land and the other agricultural opportunities.\n\nAnd thus the peasants clearly understood that the power of God is\nmanifested not in evil, but in goodness.\n\n\n\n'
