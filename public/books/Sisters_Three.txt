The squeak of wheels is seldom heard in the\nsnow-covered street. There are no lights left in the windows and the\nstreet lamps have been extinguished. Only the sound of bells, borne\nover the city from the church towers, suggests the approach of morning.\nThe streets are deserted. At rare intervals a night-cabman\xe2\x80\x99s sledge\nkneads up the snow and sand in the street as the driver makes his way\nto another corner where he falls asleep while waiting for a fare. An\nold woman passes by on her way to church, where a few wax candles burn\nwith a red light reflected on the gilt mountings of the icons. Workmen\nare already getting up after the long winter night and going to their\nwork\xe2\x80\x94but for the gentlefolk it is still evening.\n\nFrom a window in Chevalier\xe2\x80\x99s Restaurant a light\xe2\x80\x94illegal at that hour\xe2\x80\x94is\nstill to be seen through a chink in the shutter. At the entrance a\ncarriage, a sledge, and a cabman\xe2\x80\x99s sledge, stand close together with\ntheir backs to the curbstone. A three-horse sledge from the\npost-station is there also. A yard-porter muffled up and pinched with\ncold is sheltering behind the corner of the house.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s the good of all this jawing?\xe2\x80\x9d thinks the footman who sits\nin the hall weary and haggard. \xe2\x80\x9cThis always happens when I\xe2\x80\x99m on duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFrom the adjoining room are heard the voices of three young men,\nsitting there at a table on which are wine and the remains of supper.\nOne, a rather plain, thin, neat little man, sits looking with tired\nkindly eyes at his friend, who is about to start on a journey. Another,\na tall man, lies on a sofa beside a table on which are empty bottles,\nand plays with his watch-key. A third, wearing a short, fur-lined coat,\nis pacing up and down the room stopping now and then to crack an almond\nbetween his strong, rather thick, but well-tended fingers. He keeps\nsmiling at something and his face and eyes are all aglow. He speaks\nwarmly and gesticulates, but evidently does not find the words he wants\nand those that occur to him seem to him inadequate to express what has\nrisen to his heart.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I can speak out fully,\xe2\x80\x9d said the traveller. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\ndefend myself, but I should like you at least to understand me as I\nunderstand myself, and not look at the matter superficially. You say I\nhave treated her badly,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, addressing the man with the\nkindly eyes who was watching him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you are to blame,\xe2\x80\x9d said the latter, and his look seemed to\nexpress still more kindliness and weariness.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know why you say that,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the one who was leaving. \xe2\x80\x9cTo be\nloved is in your opinion as great a happiness as to love, and if a man\nobtains it, it is enough for his whole life.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, quite enough, my dear fellow, more than enough!\xe2\x80\x9d confirmed the\nplain little man, opening and shutting his eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the man love too?\xe2\x80\x9d said the traveller thoughtfully,\nlooking at his friend with something like pity. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t one\nlove? Because love doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come ... No, to be beloved is a misfortune.\nIt is a misfortune to feel guilty because you do not give something you\ncannot give. O my God!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with a gesture of his arm. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it all\nhappened reasonably, and not all topsy-turvy\xe2\x80\x94not in our way but in a\nway of its own! Why, it\xe2\x80\x99s as if I had stolen that love! You think so\ntoo, don\xe2\x80\x99t deny it. You must think so. But will you believe it, of all\nthe horrid and stupid things I have found time to do in my life\xe2\x80\x94and\nthere are many\xe2\x80\x94this is one I do not and cannot repent of. Neither at\nthe beginning nor afterwards did I lie to myself or to her. It seemed\nto me that I had at last fallen in love, but then I saw that it was an\ninvoluntary falsehood, and that that was not the way to love, and I\ncould not go on, but she did. Am I to blame that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t? What was I\nto do?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s ended now!\xe2\x80\x9d said his friend, lighting a cigar to master his\nsleepiness. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is that you have not yet loved and do not know\nwhat love is.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe man in the fur-lined coat was going to speak again, and put his\nhands to his head, but could not express what he wanted to say.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever loved! ... Yes, quite true, I never have! But after all, I have\nwithin me a desire to love, and nothing could be stronger than that\ndesire! But then, again, does such love exist? There always remains\nsomething incomplete. Ah well! What\xe2\x80\x99s the use of talking? I\xe2\x80\x99ve made an\nawful mess of life! But anyhow it\xe2\x80\x99s all over now; you are quite right.\nAnd I feel that I am beginning a new life.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich you will again make a mess of,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man who lay on the sofa\nplaying with his watch-key. But the traveller did not listen to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sad and yet glad to go,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy I am sad I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the traveller went on talking about himself, without noticing that\nthis did not interest the others as much as it did him. A man is never\nsuch an egotist as at moments of spiritual ecstasy. At such times it\nseems to him that there is nothing on earth more splendid and\ninteresting than himself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDm\xc3\xadtri Andr\xc3\xa9ich! The coachman won\xe2\x80\x99t wait any longer!\xe2\x80\x9d said a young\nserf, entering the room in a sheepskin coat, with a scarf tied round\nhis head. \xe2\x80\x9cThe horses have been standing since twelve, and it\xe2\x80\x99s now\nfour o\xe2\x80\x99clock!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDm\xc3\xadtri Andr\xc3\xa9ich looked at his serf, Vany\xc3\xbasha. The scarf round\nVany\xc3\xbasha\xe2\x80\x99s head, his felt boots and sleepy face, seemed to be calling\nhis master to a new life of labour, hardship, and activity.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue enough! Good-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, feeling for the unfastened hook and\neye on his coat.\n\nIn spite of advice to mollify the coachman by another tip, he put on\nhis cap and stood in the middle of the room. The friends kissed once,\nthen again, and after a pause, a third time. The man in the fur-lined\ncoat approached the table and emptied a champagne glass, then took the\nplain little man\xe2\x80\x99s hand and blushed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh well, I will speak out all the same ... I must and will be frank\nwith you because I am fond of you ... Of course you love her\xe2\x80\x94I always\nthought so\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered his friend, smiling still more gently.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd perhaps...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease sir, I have orders to put out the candles,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sleepy\nattendant, who had been listening to the last part of the conversation\nand wondering why gentlefolk always talk about one and the same thing.\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo whom shall I make out the bill? To you, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, knowing\nwhom to address and turning to the tall man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the tall man. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty-six rubles.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe tall man considered for a moment, but said nothing and put the bill\nin his pocket.\n\nThe other two continued their talk.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, you are a capital fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d said the short plain man with the\nmild eyes. Tears filled the eyes of both. They stepped into the porch.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, by the by,\xe2\x80\x9d said the traveller, turning with a blush to the tall\nman, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you settle Chevalier\xe2\x80\x99s bill and write and let me know?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, all right!\xe2\x80\x9d said the tall man, pulling on his gloves. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\nI envy you!\xe2\x80\x9d he added quite unexpectedly when they were out in the\nporch.\n\nThe traveller got into his sledge, wrapped his coat about him, and\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cWell then, come along!\xe2\x80\x9d He even moved a little to make room in\nthe sledge for the man who said he envied him\xe2\x80\x94his voice trembled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, M\xc3\xadtya! I hope that with God\xe2\x80\x99s help you...\xe2\x80\x9d said the tall\none. But his wish was that the other would go away quickly, and so he\ncould not finish the sentence.\n\nThey were silent a moment. Then someone again said, \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d and a\nvoice cried, \xe2\x80\x9cReady,\xe2\x80\x9d and the coachman touched up the horses.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHy, Elis\xc3\xa1r!\xe2\x80\x9d One of the friends called out, and the other coachman and\nthe sledge-drivers began moving, clicking their tongues and pulling at\nthe reins. Then the stiffened carriage-wheels rolled squeaking over the\nfrozen snow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fine fellow, that Ol\xc3\xa9nin!\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the friends. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what an\nidea to go to the Caucasus\xe2\x80\x94as a cadet, too! I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it for\nanything. ... Are you dining at the club tomorrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey separated.\n\nThe traveller felt warm, his fur coat seemed too hot. He sat on the\nbottom of the sledge and unfastened his coat, and the three shaggy\npost-horses dragged themselves out of one dark street into another,\npast houses he had never before seen. It seemed to Ol\xc3\xa9nin that only\ntravellers starting on a long journey went through those streets. All\nwas dark and silent and dull around him, but his soul was full of\nmemories, love, regrets, and a pleasant tearful feeling.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter II\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m fond of them, very fond! ... First-rate fellows! ... Fine!\xe2\x80\x9d he\nkept repeating, and felt ready to cry. But why he wanted to cry, who\nwere the first-rate fellows he was so fond of\xe2\x80\x94was more than he quite\nknew. Now and then he looked round at some house and wondered why it\nwas so curiously built; sometimes he began wondering why the post-boy\nand Vany\xc3\xbasha, who were so different from himself, sat so near, and\ntogether with him were being jerked about and swayed by the tugs the\nside-horses gave at the frozen traces, and again he repeated: \xe2\x80\x9cFirst\nrate ... very fond!\xe2\x80\x9d and once he even said: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how it seizes one ...\nexcellent!\xe2\x80\x9d and wondered what made him say it. \xe2\x80\x9cDear me, am I drunk?\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe asked himself. He had had a couple of bottles of wine, but it was\nnot the wine alone that was having this effect on Ol\xc3\xa9nin. He remembered\nall the words of friendship heartily, bashfully, spontaneously (as he\nbelieved) addressed to him on his departure. He remembered the clasp of\nhands, glances, the moments of silence, and the sound of a voice\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, M\xc3\xadtya!\xe2\x80\x9d when he was already in the sledge. He\nremembered his own deliberate frankness. And all this had a touching\nsignificance for him. Not only friends and relatives, not only people\nwho had been indifferent to him, but even those who did not like him,\nseemed to have agreed to become fonder of him, or to forgive him,\nbefore his departure, as people do before confession or death. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps\nI shall not return from the Caucasus,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. And he felt that he\nloved his friends and some one besides. He was sorry for himself. But\nit was not love for his friends that so stirred and uplifted his heart\nthat he could not repress the meaningless words that seemed to rise of\nthemselves to his lips; nor was it love for a woman (he had never yet\nbeen in love) that had brought on this mood. Love for himself, love\nfull of hope\xe2\x80\x94warm young love for all that was good in his own soul (and\nat that moment it seemed to him that there was nothing but good in\nit)\xe2\x80\x94compelled him to weep and to mutter incoherent words.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin was a youth who had never completed his university course, never\nserved anywhere (having only a nominal post in some government office\nor other), who had squandered half his fortune and had reached the age\nof twenty-four without having done anything or even chosen a career. He\nwas what in Moscow society is termed _un jeune homme_.\n\nAt the age of eighteen he was free\xe2\x80\x94as only rich young Russians in the\n\xe2\x80\x99forties who had lost their parents at an early age could be. Neither\nphysical nor moral fetters of any kind existed for him; he could do as\nhe liked, lacking nothing and bound by nothing. Neither relatives, nor\nfatherland, nor religion, nor wants, existed for him. He believed in\nnothing and admitted nothing. But although he believed in nothing he\nwas not a morose or blase young man, nor self-opinionated, but on the\ncontrary continually let himself be carried away. He had come to the\nconclusion that there is no such thing as love, yet his heart always\noverflowed in the presence of any young and attractive woman. He had\nlong been aware that honours and position were nonsense, yet\ninvoluntarily he felt pleased when at a ball Prince Sergius came up and\nspoke to him affably. But he yielded to his impulses only in so far as\nthey did not limit his freedom. As soon as he had yielded to any\ninfluence and became conscious of its leading on to labour and\nstruggle, he instinctively hastened to free himself from the feeling or\nactivity into which he was being drawn and to regain his freedom. In\nthis way he experimented with society-life, the civil service, farming,\nmusic\xe2\x80\x94to which at one time he intended to devote his life\xe2\x80\x94and even with\nthe love of women in which he did not believe. He meditated on the use\nto which he should devote that power of youth which is granted to man\nonly once in a lifetime: that force which gives a man the power of\nmaking himself, or even\xe2\x80\x94as it seemed to him\xe2\x80\x94of making the universe,\ninto anything he wishes: should it be to art, to science, to love of\nwoman, or to practical activities? It is true that some people are\ndevoid of this impulse, and on entering life at once place their necks\nunder the first yoke that offers itself and honestly labour under it\nfor the rest of their lives. But Ol\xc3\xa9nin was too strongly conscious of\nthe presence of that all-powerful God of Youth\xe2\x80\x94of that capacity to be\nentirely transformed into an aspiration or idea\xe2\x80\x94the capacity to wish\nand to do\xe2\x80\x94to throw oneself headlong into a bottomless abyss without\nknowing why or wherefore. He bore this consciousness within himself,\nwas proud of it and, without knowing it, was happy in that\nconsciousness. Up to that time he had loved only himself, and could not\nhelp loving himself, for he expected nothing but good of himself and\nhad not yet had time to be disillusioned. On leaving Moscow he was in\nthat happy state of mind in which a young man, conscious of past\nmistakes, suddenly says to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cThat was not the real thing.\xe2\x80\x9d All\nthat had gone before was accidental and unimportant. Till then he had\nnot really tried to live, but now with his departure from Moscow a new\nlife was beginning\xe2\x80\x94a life in which there would be no mistakes, no\nremorse, and certainly nothing but happiness.\n\nIt is always the case on a long journey that till the first two or\nthree stages have been passed imagination continues to dwell on the\nplace left behind, but with the first morning on the road it leaps to\nthe end of the journey and there begins building castles in the air. So\nit happened to Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\nAfter leaving the town behind, he gazed at the snowy fields and felt\nglad to be alone in their midst. Wrapping himself in his fur coat, he\nlay at the bottom of the sledge, became tranquil, and fell into a doze.\nThe parting with his friends had touched him deeply, and memories of\nthat last winter spent in Moscow and images of the past, mingled with\nvague thoughts and regrets, rose unbidden in his imagination.\n\nHe remembered the friend who had seen him off and his relations with\nthe girl they had talked about. The girl was rich. \xe2\x80\x9cHow could he love\nher knowing that she loved me?\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, and evil suspicions crossed\nhis mind. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is much dishonesty in men when one comes to reflect.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThen he was confronted by the question: \xe2\x80\x9cBut really, how is it I have\nnever been in love? Every one tells me that I never have. Can it be\nthat I am a moral monstrosity?\xe2\x80\x9d And he began to recall all his\ninfatuations. He recalled his entry into society, and a friend\xe2\x80\x99s sister\nwith whom he spent several evenings at a table with a lamp on it which\nlit up her slender fingers busy with needlework, and the lower part of\nher pretty delicate face. He recalled their conversations that dragged\non like the game in which one passes on a stick which one keeps alight\nas long as possible, and the general awkwardness and restraint and his\ncontinual feeling of rebellion at all that conventionality. Some voice\nhad always whispered: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not it, that\xe2\x80\x99s not it,\xe2\x80\x9d and so it had\nproved. Then he remembered a ball and the mazurka he danced with the\nbeautiful D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much in love I was that night and how happy! And\nhow hurt and vexed I was next morning when I woke and felt myself still\nfree! Why does not love come and bind me hand and foot?\xe2\x80\x9d thought he.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, there is no such thing as love! That neighbour who used to tell\nme, as she told Dubr\xc3\xb3vin and the Marshal, that she loved the stars, was\nnot _it_ either.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd now his farming and work in the country recurred to his mind, and\nin those recollections also there was nothing to dwell on with\npleasure. \xe2\x80\x9cWill they talk long of my departure?\xe2\x80\x9d came into his head;\nbut who \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x9d were he did not quite know. Next came a thought that\nmade him wince and mutter incoherently. It was the recollection of M.\nCappele the tailor, and the six hundred and seventy-eight rubles he\nstill owed him, and he recalled the words in which he had begged him to\nwait another year, and the look of perplexity and resignation which had\nappeared on the tailor\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated,\nwincing and trying to drive away the intolerable thought. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the same\nand in spite of everything she loved me,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he of the girl they\nhad talked about at the farewell supper. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, had I married her I\nshould not now be owing anything, and as it is I am in debt to\nVas\xc3\xadlyev.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he remembered the last night he had played with\nVas\xc3\xadlyev at the club (just after leaving her), and he recalled his\nhumiliating requests for another game and the other\xe2\x80\x99s cold refusal. \xe2\x80\x9cA\nyear\xe2\x80\x99s economizing and they will all be paid, and the devil take\nthem!\xe2\x80\x9d... But despite this assurance he again began calculating his\noutstanding debts, their dates, and when he could hope to pay them off.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I owe something to Morell as well as to Chevalier,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he,\nrecalling the night when he had run up so large a debt. It was at a\ncarousel at the gipsies arranged by some fellows from Petersburg:\nS\xc3\xa1shka B\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, an aide-de-camp to the Tsar, Prince D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, and that pompous\nold\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94. \xe2\x80\x9cHow is it those gentlemen are so self-satisfied?\xe2\x80\x9d thought he,\n\xe2\x80\x9cand by what right do they form a clique to which they think others\nmust be highly flattered to be admitted? Can it be because they are on\nthe Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s staff? Why, it\xe2\x80\x99s awful what fools and scoundrels they\nconsider other people to be! But I showed them that I at any rate, on\nthe contrary, do not at all want their intimacy. All the same, I fancy\nAndrew, the steward, would be amazed to know that I am on familiar\nterms with a man like S\xc3\xa1shka B\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, a colonel and an aide-de-camp to the\nTsar! Yes, and no one drank more than I did that evening, and I taught\nthe gipsies a new song and everyone listened to it. Though I have done\nmany foolish things, all the same I am a very good fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he.\n\nMorning found him at the third post-stage. He drank tea, and himself\nhelped Vany\xc3\xbasha to move his bundles and trunks and sat down among them,\nsensible, erect, and precise, knowing where all his belongings were,\nhow much money he had and where it was, where he had put his passport\nand the post-horse requisition and toll-gate papers, and it all seemed\nto him so well arranged that he grew quite cheerful and the long\njourney before him seemed an extended pleasure-trip.\n\nAll that morning and noon he was deep in calculations of how many\nversts he had travelled, how many remained to the next stage, how many\nto the next town, to the place where he would dine, to the place where\nhe would drink tea, and to Stavr\xc3\xb3pol, and what fraction of the whole\njourney was already accomplished. He also calculated how much money he\nhad with him, how much would be left over, how much would pay off all\nhis debts, and what proportion of his income he would spend each month.\nTowards evening, after tea, he calculated that to Stavr\xc3\xb3pol there still\nremained seven-elevenths of the whole journey, that his debts would\nrequire seven months\xe2\x80\x99 economy and one-eighth of his whole fortune; and\nthen, tranquillized, he wrapped himself up, lay down in the sledge, and\nagain dozed off. His imagination was now turned to the future: to the\nCaucasus. All his dreams of the future were mingled with pictures of\nAmalat-Beks, Circassian women, mountains, precipices, terrible\ntorrents, and perils. All these things were vague and dim, but the love\nof fame and the danger of death furnished the interest of that future.\nNow, with unprecedented courage and a strength that amazed everyone, he\nslew and subdued an innumerable host of hillsmen; now he was himself a\nhillsman and with them was maintaining their independence against the\nRussians. As soon as he pictured anything definite, familiar Moscow\nfigures always appeared on the scene. S\xc3\xa1shka B\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 fights with the\nRussians or the hillsmen against him. Even the tailor Cappele in some\nstrange way takes part in the conqueror\xe2\x80\x99s triumph. Amid all this he\nremembered his former humiliations, weaknesses, and mistakes, and the\nrecollection was not disagreeable. It was clear that there among the\nmountains, waterfalls, fair Circassians, and dangers, such mistakes\ncould not recur. Having once made full confession to himself there was\nan end of it all. One other vision, the sweetest of them all, mingled\nwith the young man\xe2\x80\x99s every thought of the future\xe2\x80\x94the vision of a woman.\nAnd there, among the mountains, she appeared to his imagination as a\nCircassian slave, a fine figure with a long plait of hair and deep\nsubmissive eyes. He pictured a lonely hut in the mountains, and on the\nthreshold _she_ stands awaiting him when, tired and covered with dust,\nblood, and fame, he returns to her. He is conscious of her kisses, her\nshoulders, her sweet voice, and her submissiveness. She is enchanting,\nbut uneducated, wild, and rough. In the long winter evenings he begins\nher education. She is clever and gifted and quickly acquires all the\nknowledge essential. Why not? She can quite easily learn foreign\nlanguages, read the French masterpieces and understand them: _Notre\nDame de Paris_, for instance, is sure to please her. She can also speak\nFrench. In a drawing-room she can show more innate dignity than a lady\nof the highest society. She can sing, simply, powerfully, and\npassionately.... \xe2\x80\x9cOh, what nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d said he to himself. But here they\nreached a post-station and he had to change into another sledge and\ngive some tips. But his fancy again began searching for the \xe2\x80\x9cnonsense\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe had relinquished, and again fair Circassians, glory, and his return\nto Russia with an appointment as aide-de-camp and a lovely wife rose\nbefore his imagination. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there\xe2\x80\x99s no such thing as love,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to\nhimself. \xe2\x80\x9cFame is all rubbish. But the six hundred and seventy-eight\nrubles?... And the conquered land that will bring me more wealth than I\nneed for a lifetime? It will not be right though to keep all that\nwealth for myself. I shall have to distribute it. But to whom? Well,\nsix hundred and seventy-eight rubles to Cappele and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xe2\x80\x9d\n... Quite vague visions now cloud his mind, and only Vany\xc3\xbasha\xe2\x80\x99s voice\nand the interrupted motion of the sledge break his healthy youthful\nslumber. Scarcely conscious, he changes into another sledge at the next\nstage and continues his journey.\n\nNext morning everything goes on just the same: the same kind of\npost-stations and tea-drinking, the same moving horses\xe2\x80\x99 cruppers, the\nsame short talks with Vany\xc3\xbasha, the same vague dreams and drowsiness,\nand the same tired, healthy, youthful sleep at night.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter III\n\n\nThe farther Ol\xc3\xa9nin travelled from Central Russia the farther he left\nhis memories behind, and the nearer he drew to the Caucasus the lighter\nhis heart became. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll stay away for good and never return to show\nmyself in society,\xe2\x80\x9d was a thought that sometimes occurred to him.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese people whom I see here are _not_ people. None of them know me\nand none of them can ever enter the Moscow society I was in or find out\nabout my past. And no one in that society will ever know what I am\ndoing, living among these people.\xe2\x80\x9d And quite a new feeling of freedom\nfrom his whole past came over him among the rough beings he met on the\nroad whom he did not consider to be _people_ in the sense that his\nMoscow acquaintances were.\n\nThe rougher the people and the fewer the signs of civilization the\nfreer he felt. Stavr\xc3\xb3pol, through which he had to pass, irked him. The\nsignboards, some of them even in French, ladies in carriages, cabs in\nthe marketplace, and a gentleman wearing a fur cloak and tall hat who\nwas walking along the boulevard and staring at the passersby, quite\nupset him. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps these people know some of my acquaintances,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nthought; and the club, his tailor, cards, society ... came back to his\nmind. But after Stavr\xc3\xb3pol everything was satisfactory\xe2\x80\x94wild and also\nbeautiful and warlike, and Ol\xc3\xa9nin felt happier and happier. All the\nCossacks, post-boys, and post-station masters seemed to him simple folk\nwith whom he could jest and converse simply, without having to consider\nto what class they belonged. They all belonged to the human race which,\nwithout his thinking about it, all appeared dear to Ol\xc3\xa9nin, and they\nall treated him in a friendly way.\n\nAlready in the province of the Don Cossacks his sledge had been\nexchanged for a cart, and beyond Stavr\xc3\xb3pol it became so warm that\nOl\xc3\xa9nin travelled without wearing his fur coat. It was already spring\xe2\x80\x94an\nunexpected joyous spring for Ol\xc3\xa9nin. At night he was no longer allowed\nto leave the Cossack villages, and they said it was dangerous to travel\nin the evening. Vany\xc3\xbasha began to be uneasy, and they carried a loaded\ngun in the cart. Ol\xc3\xa9nin became still happier. At one of the\npost-stations the post-master told of a terrible murder that had been\ncommitted recently on the high road. They began to meet armed men. \xe2\x80\x9cSo\nthis is where it begins!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Ol\xc3\xa9nin, and kept expecting to see the\nsnowy mountains of which mention was so often made. Once, towards\nevening, the Nog\xc3\xa1y driver pointed with his whip to the mountains\nshrouded in clouds. Ol\xc3\xa9nin looked eagerly, but it was dull and the\nmountains were almost hidden by the clouds. Ol\xc3\xa9nin made out something\ngrey and white and fleecy, but try as he would he could find nothing\nbeautiful in the mountains of which he had so often read and heard. The\nmountains and the clouds appeared to him quite alike, and he thought\nthe special beauty of the snow peaks, of which he had so often been\ntold, was as much an invention as Bach\xe2\x80\x99s music and the love of women,\nin which he did not believe. So he gave up looking forward to seeing\nthe mountains. But early next morning, being awakened in his cart by\nthe freshness of the air, he glanced carelessly to the right. The\nmorning was perfectly clear. Suddenly he saw, about twenty paces away\nas it seemed to him at first glance, pure white gigantic masses with\ndelicate contours, the distinct fantastic outlines of their summits\nshowing sharply against the far-off sky. When he had realized the\ndistance between himself and them and the sky and the whole immensity\nof the mountains, and felt the infinitude of all that beauty, he became\nafraid that it was but a phantasm or a dream. He gave himself a shake\nto rouse himself, but the mountains were still the same.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that! What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the driver.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the mountains,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Nog\xc3\xa1y driver with indifference.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I too have been looking at them for a long while,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vany\xc3\xbasha.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t they fine? They won\xe2\x80\x99t believe it at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe quick progress of the three-horsed cart along the smooth road\ncaused the mountains to appear to be running along the horizon, while\ntheir rosy crests glittered in the light of the rising sun. At first\nOl\xc3\xa9nin was only astonished at the sight, then gladdened by it; but\nlater on, gazing more and more intently at that snow-peaked chain that\nseemed to rise not from among other black mountains, but straight out\nof the plain, and to glide away into the distance, he began by slow\ndegrees to be penetrated by their beauty and at length to _feel_ the\nmountains. From that moment all he saw, all he thought, and all he\nfelt, acquired for him a new character, sternly majestic like the\nmountains! All his Moscow reminiscences, shame, and repentance, and his\ntrivial dreams about the Caucasus, vanished and did not return. \xe2\x80\x9cNow it\nhas begun,\xe2\x80\x9d a solemn voice seemed to say to him. The road and the\nT\xc3\xa9rek, just becoming visible in the distance, and the Cossack villages\nand the people, all no longer appeared to him as a joke. He looked at\nhimself or Vany\xc3\xbasha, and again thought of the mountains. ... Two\nCossacks ride by, their guns in their cases swinging rhythmically\nbehind their backs, the white and bay legs of their horses mingling\nconfusedly ... and the mountains! Beyond the T\xc3\xa9rek rises the smoke from\na Tartar village... and the mountains! The sun has risen and glitters\non the T\xc3\xa9rek, now visible beyond the reeds ... and the mountains! From\nthe village comes a Tartar wagon, and women, beautiful young women,\npass by... and the mountains! \xe2\x80\x9c_Abreks_ canter about the plain, and\nhere am I driving along and do not fear them! I have a gun, and\nstrength, and youth... and the mountains!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n Chapter IV\n\n\nThat whole part of the T\xc3\xa9rek line (about fifty miles) along which lie\nthe villages of the Greb\xc3\xa9nsk Cossacks is uniform in character both as\nto country and inhabitants. The T\xc3\xa9rek, which separates the Cossacks\nfrom the mountaineers, still flows turbid and rapid though already\nbroad and smooth, always depositing greyish sand on its low reedy right\nbank and washing away the steep, though not high, left bank, with its\nroots of century-old oaks, its rotting plane trees, and young\nbrushwood. On the right bank lie the villages of pro-Russian, though\nstill somewhat restless, Tartars. Along the left bank, back half a mile\nfrom the river and standing five or six miles apart from one another,\nare Cossack villages. In olden times most of these villages were\nsituated on the banks of the river; but the T\xc3\xa9rek, shifting northward\nfrom the mountains year by year, washed away those banks, and now there\nremain only the ruins of the old villages and of the gardens of pear\nand plum trees and poplars, all overgrown with blackberry bushes and\nwild vines. No one lives there now, and one only sees the tracks of the\ndeer, the wolves, the hares, and the pheasants, who have learned to\nlove these places. From village to village runs a road cut through the\nforest as a cannon-shot might fly. Along the roads are cordons of\nCossacks and watch-towers with sentinels in them. Only a narrow strip\nabout seven hundred yards wide of fertile wooded soil belongs to the\nCossacks. To the north of it begin the sand-drifts of the Nog\xc3\xa1y or\nMozd\xc3\xb3k steppes, which fetch far to the north and run, Heaven knows\nwhere, into the Trukhm\xc3\xa9n, Astrakh\xc3\xa1n, and Kirgh\xc3\xadz-Kais\xc3\xa1tsk steppes. To\nthe south, beyond the T\xc3\xa9rek, are the Great Ch\xc3\xa9chnya river, the\nKochk\xc3\xa1lov range, the Black Mountains, yet another range, and at last\nthe snowy mountains, which can just be seen but have never yet been\nscaled. In this fertile wooded strip, rich in vegetation, has dwelt as\nfar back as memory runs the fine warlike and prosperous Russian tribe\nbelonging to the sect of Old Believers, and called the Greb\xc3\xa9nsk\nCossacks.\n\nLong long ago their Old Believer ancestors fled from Russia and settled\nbeyond the T\xc3\xa9rek among the Ch\xc3\xa9chens on the Greb\xc3\xa9n, the first range of\nwooded mountains of Ch\xc3\xa9chnya. Living among the Ch\xc3\xa9chens the Cossacks\nintermarried with them and adopted the manners and customs of the hill\ntribes, though they still retained the Russian language in all its\npurity, as well as their Old Faith. A tradition, still fresh among\nthem, declares that Tsar Iv\xc3\xa1n the Terrible came to the T\xc3\xa9rek, sent for\ntheir Elders, and gave them the land on this side of the river,\nexhorting them to remain friendly to Russia and promising not to\nenforce his rule upon them nor oblige them to change their faith. Even\nnow the Cossack families claim relationship with the Ch\xc3\xa9chens, and the\nlove of freedom, of leisure, of plunder and of war, still form their\nchief characteristics. Only the harmful side of Russian influence shows\nitself\xe2\x80\x94by interference at elections, by confiscation of church bells,\nand by the troops who are quartered in the country or march through it.\n\nA Cossack is inclined to hate less the _dzhigit_ hillsman who maybe has\nkilled his brother, than the soldier quartered on him to defend his\nvillage, but who has defiled his hut with tobacco-smoke. He respects\nhis enemy the hillsman and despises the soldier, who is in his eyes an\nalien and an oppressor. In reality, from a Cossack\xe2\x80\x99s point of view a\nRussian peasant is a foreign, savage, despicable creature, of whom he\nsees a sample in the hawkers who come to the country and in the\nUkrainian immigrants whom the Cossack contemptuously calls\n\xe2\x80\x9cwoolbeaters\xe2\x80\x9d. For him, to be smartly dressed means to be dressed like\na Circassian. The best weapons are obtained from the hillsmen and the\nbest horses are bought, or stolen, from them. A dashing young Cossack\nlikes to show off his knowledge of Tartar, and when carousing talks\nTartar even to his fellow Cossack.\n\nIn spite of all these things this small Christian clan stranded in a\ntiny corner of the earth, surrounded by half-savage Mohammedan tribes\nand by soldiers, considers itself highly advanced, acknowledges none\nbut Cossacks as human beings, and despises everybody else. The Cossack\nspends most of his time in the cordon, in action, or in hunting and\nfishing. He hardly ever works at home. When he stays in the village it\nis an exception to the general rule and then he is holiday-making. All\nCossacks make their own wine, and drunkenness is not so much a general\ntendency as a rite, the non-fulfilment of which would be considered\napostasy. The Cossack looks upon a woman as an instrument for his\nwelfare; only the unmarried girls are allowed to amuse themselves. A\nmarried woman has to work for her husband from youth to very old age:\nhis demands on her are the Oriental ones of submission and labour. In\nconsequence of this outlook women are strongly developed both\nphysically and mentally, and though they are\xe2\x80\x94as everywhere in the\nEast\xe2\x80\x94nominally in subjection, they possess far greater influence and\nimportance in family-life than Western women. Their exclusion from\npublic life and inurement to heavy male labour give the women all the\nmore power and importance in the household. A Cossack, who before\nstrangers considers it improper to speak affectionately or needlessly\nto his wife, when alone with her is involuntarily conscious of her\nsuperiority. His house and all his property, in fact the entire\nhomestead, has been acquired and is kept together solely by her labour\nand care. Though firmly convinced that labour is degrading to a Cossack\nand is only proper for a Nog\xc3\xa1y labourer or a woman, he is vaguely aware\nof the fact that all he makes use of and calls his own is the result of\nthat toil, and that it is in the power of the woman (his mother or his\nwife) whom he considers his slave, to deprive him of all he possesses.\nBesides, the continuous performance of man\xe2\x80\x99s heavy work and the\nresponsibilities entrusted to her have endowed the Greb\xc3\xa9nsk women with\na peculiarly independent masculine character and have remarkably\ndeveloped their physical powers, common sense, resolution, and\nstability. The women are in most cases stronger, more intelligent, more\ndeveloped, and handsomer than the men. A striking feature of a Greb\xc3\xa9nsk\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s beauty is the combination of the purest Circassian type of face\nwith the broad and powerful build of Northern women. Cossack women wear\nthe Circassian dress: a Tartar smock, _beshmet_, and soft slippers; but\nthey tie their kerchiefs round their heads in the Russian fashion.\nSmartness, cleanliness and elegance in dress and in the arrangement of\ntheir huts, are with them a custom and a necessity. In their relations\nwith men the women, and especially the unmarried girls, enjoy perfect\nfreedom.\n\nNovoml\xc3\xadnsk village was considered the very heart of Greb\xc3\xa9nsk\nCossackdom. In it more than elsewhere the customs of the old Greb\xc3\xa9nsk\npopulation have been preserved, and its women have from time immemorial\nbeen renowned all over the Caucasus for their beauty. A Cossack\xe2\x80\x99s\nlivelihood is derived from vineyards, fruit-gardens, water melon and\npumpkin plantations, from fishing, hunting, maize and millet growing,\nand from war plunder. Novoml\xc3\xadnsk village lies about two and a half\nmiles away from the T\xc3\xa9rek, from which it is separated by a dense\nforest. On one side of the road which runs through the village is the\nriver; on the other, green vineyards and orchards, beyond which are\nseen the driftsands of the Nog\xc3\xa1y Steppe. The village is surrounded by\nearth-banks and prickly bramble hedges, and is entered by tall gates\nhung between posts and covered with little reed-thatched roofs. Beside\nthem on a wooden gun-carriage stands an unwieldy cannon captured by the\nCossacks at some time or other, and which has not been fired for a\nhundred years. A uniformed Cossack sentinel with dagger and gun\nsometimes stands, and sometimes does not stand, on guard beside the\ngates, and sometimes presents arms to a passing officer and sometimes\ndoes not.\n\nBelow the roof of the gateway is written in black letters on a white\nboard: \xe2\x80\x9cHouses 266: male inhabitants 897: female 1012.\xe2\x80\x9d The Cossacks\xe2\x80\x99\nhouses are all raised on pillars two and a half feet from the ground.\nThey are carefully thatched with reeds and have large carved gables. If\nnot new they are at least all straight and clean, with high porches of\ndifferent shapes; and they are not built close together but have ample\nspace around them, and are all picturesquely placed along broad streets\nand lanes. In front of the large bright windows of many of the houses,\nbeyond the kitchen gardens, dark green poplars and acacias with their\ndelicate pale verdure and scented white blossoms overtop the houses,\nand beside them grow flaunting yellow sunflowers, creepers, and grape\nvines. In the broad open square are three shops where drapery,\nsunflower and pumpkin seeds, locust beans and gingerbreads are sold;\nand surrounded by a tall fence, loftier and larger than the other\nhouses, stands the Regimental Commander\xe2\x80\x99s dwelling with its casement\nwindows, behind a row of tall poplars. Few people are to be seen in the\nstreets of the village on weekdays, especially in summer. The young men\nare on duty in the cordons or on military expeditions; the old ones are\nfishing or helping the women in the orchards and gardens. Only the very\nold, the sick, and the children, remain at home.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter V\n\n\nIt was one of those wonderful evenings that occur only in the Caucasus.\nThe sun had sunk behind the mountains but it was still light. The\nevening glow had spread over a third of the sky, and against its\nbrilliancy the dull white immensity of the mountains was sharply\ndefined. The air was rarefied, motionless, and full of sound. The\nshadow of the mountains reached for several miles over the steppe. The\nsteppe, the opposite side of the river, and the roads, were all\ndeserted. If very occasionally mounted men appeared, the Cossacks in\nthe cordon and the Ch\xc3\xa9chens in their _aouls_ (villages) watched them\nwith surprised curiosity and tried to guess who those questionable men\ncould be.\n\nAt nightfall people from fear of one another flock to their dwellings,\nand only birds and beasts fearless of man prowl in those deserted\nspaces. Talking merrily, the women who have been tying up the vines\nhurry away from the gardens before sunset. The vineyards, like all the\nsurrounding district, are deserted, but the villages become very\nanimated at that time of the evening. From all sides, walking, riding,\nor driving in their creaking carts, people move towards the village.\nGirls with their smocks tucked up and twigs in their hands run chatting\nmerrily to the village gates to meet the cattle that are crowding\ntogether in a cloud of dust and mosquitoes which they bring with them\nfrom the steppe. The well-fed cows and buffaloes disperse at a run all\nover the streets and Cossack women in coloured _beshmets_ go to and fro\namong them. You can hear their merry laughter and shrieks mingling with\nthe lowing of the cattle. There an armed and mounted Cossack, on leave\nfrom the cordon, rides up to a hut and, leaning towards the window,\nknocks. In answer to the knock the handsome head of a young woman\nappears at the window and you can hear caressing, laughing voices.\nThere a tattered Nog\xc3\xa1y labourer, with prominent cheekbones, brings a\nload of reeds from the steppes, turns his creaking cart into the\nCossack captain\xe2\x80\x99s broad and clean courtyard, and lifts the yoke off the\noxen that stand tossing their heads while he and his master shout to\none another in Tartar. Past a puddle that reaches nearly across the\nstreet, a barefooted Cossack woman with a bundle of firewood on her\nback makes her laborious way by clinging to the fences, holding her\nsmock high and exposing her white legs. A Cossack returning from\nshooting calls out in jest: \xe2\x80\x9cLift it higher, shameless thing!\xe2\x80\x9d and\npoints his gun at her. The woman lets down her smock and drops the\nwood. An old Cossack, returning home from fishing with his trousers\ntucked up and his hairy grey chest uncovered, has a net across his\nshoulder containing silvery fish that are still struggling; and to take\na short cut climbs over his neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s broken fence and gives a tug to\nhis coat which has caught on the fence. There a woman is dragging a dry\nbranch along and from round the corner comes the sound of an axe.\nCossack children, spinning their tops wherever there is a smooth place\nin the street, are shrieking; women are climbing over fences to avoid\ngoing round. From every chimney rises the odorous _kisyak_ smoke. From\nevery homestead comes the sound of increased bustle, precursor to the\nstillness of night.\n\nGranny Ul\xc3\xadtka, the wife of the Cossack cornet who is also teacher in\nthe regimental school, goes out to the gates of her yard like the other\nwomen, and waits for the cattle which her daughter Mary\xc3\xa1nka is driving\nalong the street. Before she has had time fully to open the wattle gate\nin the fence, an enormous buffalo cow surrounded by mosquitoes rushes\nup bellowing and squeezes in. Several well-fed cows slowly follow her,\ntheir large eyes gazing with recognition at their mistress as they\nswish their sides with their tails.\n\nThe beautiful and shapely Mary\xc3\xa1nka enters at the gate and throwing away\nher switch quickly slams the gate to and rushes with all the speed of\nher nimble feet to separate and drive the cattle into their sheds.\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake off your slippers, you devil\xe2\x80\x99s wench!\xe2\x80\x9d shouts her mother, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve\nworn them into holes!\xe2\x80\x9d Mary\xc3\xa1nka is not at all offended at being called\na \xe2\x80\x9cdevil\xe2\x80\x99s wench\xe2\x80\x9d, but accepting it as a term of endearment cheerfully\ngoes on with her task. Her face is covered with a kerchief tied round\nher head. She is wearing a pink smock and a green _beshmet_. She\ndisappears inside the lean-to shed in the yard, following the big fat\ncattle; and from the shed comes her voice as she speaks gently and\npersuasively to the buffalo: \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t she stand still? What a creature!\nCome now, come old dear!\xe2\x80\x9d Soon the girl and the old woman pass from the\nshed to the dairy carrying two large pots of milk, the day\xe2\x80\x99s yield.\nFrom the dairy chimney rises a thin cloud of _kisyak_ smoke: the milk\nis being used to make into clotted cream. The girl makes up the fire\nwhile her mother goes to the gate. Twilight has fallen on the village.\nThe air is full of the smell of vegetables, cattle, and scented\n_kisyak_ smoke. From the gates and along the streets Cossack women come\nrunning, carrying lighted rags. From the yards one hears the snorting\nand quiet chewing of the cattle eased of their milk, while in the\nstreet only the voices of women and children sound as they call to one\nanother. It is rare on a week-day to hear the drunken voice of a man.\n\nOne of the Cossack wives, a tall, masculine old woman, approaches\nGranny Ul\xc3\xadtka from the homestead opposite and asks her for a light. In\nher hand she holds a rag.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you cleared up, Granny?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe girl is lighting the fire. Is it fire you want?\xe2\x80\x9d says Granny\nUl\xc3\xadtka, proud of being able to oblige her neighbour.\n\nBoth women enter the hut, and coarse hands unused to dealing with small\narticles tremblingly lift the lid of a matchbox, which is a rarity in\nthe Caucasus. The masculine-looking new-comer sits down on the doorstep\nwith the evident intention of having a chat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is your man at the school, Mother?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s always teaching the youngsters, Mother. But he writes that he\xe2\x80\x99ll\ncome home for the holidays,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cornet\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he\xe2\x80\x99s a clever man, one sees; it all comes useful.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it does.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd my Luk\xc3\xa1shka is at the cordon; they won\xe2\x80\x99t let him come home,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nthe visitor, though the cornet\xe2\x80\x99s wife had known all this long ago. She\nwanted to talk about her Luk\xc3\xa1shka whom she had lately fitted out for\nservice in the Cossack regiment, and whom she wished to marry to the\ncornet\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, Mary\xc3\xa1nka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo he\xe2\x80\x99s at the cordon?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is, Mother. He\xe2\x80\x99s not been home since last holidays. The other day I\nsent him some shirts by F\xc3\xb3mushkin. He says he\xe2\x80\x99s all right, and that his\nsuperiors are satisfied. He says they are looking out for _abreks_\nagain. Luk\xc3\xa1shka is quite happy, he says.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh well, thank God,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cornet\xe2\x80\x99s wife. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Snatcher\xe2\x80\x99 is certainly\nthe only word for him.\xe2\x80\x9d Luk\xc3\xa1shka was surnamed \xe2\x80\x9cthe Snatcher\xe2\x80\x9d because of\nhis bravery in snatching a boy from a watery grave, and the cornet\xe2\x80\x99s\nwife alluded to this, wishing in her turn to say something agreeable to\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s mother.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank God, Mother, that he\xe2\x80\x99s a good son! He\xe2\x80\x99s a fine fellow,\neveryone praises him,\xe2\x80\x9d says Luk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s mother. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I wish is to get\nhim married; then I could die in peace.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, aren\xe2\x80\x99t there plenty of young women in the village?\xe2\x80\x9d answered the\ncornet\xe2\x80\x99s wife slyly as she carefully replaced the lid of the matchbox\nwith her horny hands.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlenty, Mother, plenty,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Luk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s mother, shaking her head.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s your girl now, your Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of girl! You\xe2\x80\x99d\nhave to search through the whole place to find such another!\xe2\x80\x9d The\ncornet\xe2\x80\x99s wife knows what Luk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s mother is after, but though she\nbelieves him to be a good Cossack she hangs back: first because she is\na cornet\xe2\x80\x99s wife and rich, while Luk\xc3\xa1shka is the son of a simple Cossack\nand fatherless, secondly because she does not want to part with her\ndaughter yet, but chiefly because propriety demands it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, when Mary\xc3\xa1nka grows up she\xe2\x80\x99ll be marriageable too,\xe2\x80\x9d she answers\nsoberly and modestly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll send the matchmakers to you\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll send them! Only let me get the\nvineyard done and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll come and make our bows to you,\xe2\x80\x9d says\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s mother. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we\xe2\x80\x99ll make our bows to Elias Vas\xc3\xadlich too.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cElias, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d says the cornet\xe2\x80\x99s wife proudly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s to me you must\nspeak! All in its own good time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s mother sees by the stern face of the cornet\xe2\x80\x99s wife that it\nis not the time to say anything more just now, so she lights her rag\nwith the match and says, rising: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t refuse us, think of my words.\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll go, it is time to light the fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs she crosses the road swinging the burning rag, she meets Mary\xc3\xa1nka,\nwho bows.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, she\xe2\x80\x99s a regular queen, a splendid worker, that girl!\xe2\x80\x9d she thinks,\nlooking at the beautiful maiden. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat need for her to grow any more?\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s time she was married and to a good home; married to Luk\xc3\xa1shka!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut Granny Ul\xc3\xadtka had her own cares and she remained sitting on the\nthreshold thinking hard about something, till the girl called her.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter VI\n\n\nThe male population of the village spend their time on military\nexpeditions and in the cordon\xe2\x80\x94or \xe2\x80\x9cat their posts\xe2\x80\x9d, as the Cossacks say.\nTowards evening, that same Luk\xc3\xa1shka the Snatcher, about whom the old\nwomen had been talking, was standing on a watch-tower of the\nN\xc3\xadzhni-Prot\xc3\xb3tsk post situated on the very banks of the T\xc3\xa9rek. Leaning\non the railing of the tower and screwing up his eyes, he looked now far\ninto the distance beyond the T\xc3\xa9rek, now down at his fellow Cossacks,\nand occasionally he addressed the latter. The sun was already\napproaching the snowy range that gleamed white above the fleecy clouds.\nThe clouds undulating at the base of the mountains grew darker and\ndarker. The clearness of evening was noticeable in the air. A sense of\nfreshness came from the woods, though round the post it was still hot.\nThe voices of the talking Cossacks vibrated more sonorously than\nbefore. The moving mass of the T\xc3\xa9rek\xe2\x80\x99s rapid brown waters contrasted\nmore vividly with its motionless banks. The waters were beginning to\nsubside and here and there the wet sands gleamed drab on the banks and\nin the shallows. The other side of the river, just opposite the cordon,\nwas deserted; only an immense waste of low-growing reeds stretched far\naway to the very foot of the mountains. On the low bank, a little to\none side, could be seen the flat-roofed clay houses and the\nfunnel-shaped chimneys of a Ch\xc3\xa9chen village. The sharp eyes of the\nCossack who stood on the watch-tower followed, through the evening\nsmoke of the pro-Russian village, the tiny moving figures of the\nCh\xc3\xa9chen women visible in the distance in their red and blue garments.\n\nAlthough the Cossacks expected _abreks_ to cross over and attack them\nfrom the Tartar side at any moment, especially as it was May when the\nwoods by the T\xc3\xa9rek are so dense that it is difficult to pass through\nthem on foot and the river is shallow enough in places for a horseman\nto ford it, and despite the fact that a couple of days before a Cossack\nhad arrived with a circular from the commander of the regiment\nannouncing that spies had reported the intention of a party of some\neight men to cross the T\xc3\xa9rek, and ordering special vigilance\xe2\x80\x94no special\nvigilance was being observed in the cordon. The Cossacks, unarmed and\nwith their horses unsaddled just as if they were at home, spent their\ntime some in fishing, some in drinking, and some in hunting. Only the\nhorse of the man on duty was saddled, and with its feet hobbled was\nmoving about by the brambles near the wood, and only the sentinel had\nhis Circassian coat on and carried a gun and sword. The corporal, a\ntall thin Cossack with an exceptionally long back and small hands and\nfeet, was sitting on the earth-bank of a hut with his _beshmet_\nunbuttoned. On his face was the lazy, bored expression of a superior,\nand having shut his eyes he dropped his head upon the palm first of one\nhand and then of the other. An elderly Cossack with a broad\ngreyish-black beard was lying in his shirt, girdled with a black strap,\nclose to the river and gazing lazily at the waves of the T\xc3\xa9rek as they\nmonotonously foamed and swirled. Others, also overcome by the heat and\nhalf naked, were rinsing clothes in the T\xc3\xa9rek, plaiting a fishing line,\nor humming tunes as they lay on the hot sand of the river bank. One\nCossack, with a thin face much burnt by the sun, lay near the hut\nevidently dead drunk, by a wall which though it had been in shadow some\ntwo hours previously was now exposed to the sun\xe2\x80\x99s fierce slanting rays.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka, who stood on the watch-tower, was a tall handsome lad about\ntwenty years old and very like his mother. His face and whole build, in\nspite of the angularity of youth, indicated great strength, both\nphysical and moral. Though he had only lately joined the Cossacks at\nthe front, it was evident from the expression of his face and the calm\nassurance of his attitude that he had already acquired the somewhat\nproud and warlike bearing peculiar to Cossacks and to men generally who\ncontinually carry arms, and that he felt he was a Cossack and fully\nknew his own value. His ample Circassian coat was torn in some places,\nhis cap was on the back of his head Ch\xc3\xa9chen fashion, and his leggings\nhad slipped below his knees. His clothing was not rich, but he wore it\nwith that peculiar Cossack foppishness which consists in imitating the\nCh\xc3\xa9chen brave. Everything on a real brave is ample, ragged, and\nneglected, only his weapons are costly. But these ragged clothes and\nthese weapons are belted and worn with a certain air and matched in a\ncertain manner, neither of which can be acquired by everybody and which\nat once strike the eye of a Cossack or a hillsman. Luk\xc3\xa1shka had this\nresemblance to a brave. With his hands folded under his sword, and his\neyes nearly closed, he kept looking at the distant Tartar village.\nTaken separately his features were not beautiful, but anyone who saw\nhis stately carriage and his dark-browed intelligent face would\ninvoluntarily say, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fine fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at the women, what a lot of them are walking about in the\nvillage,\xe2\x80\x9d said he in a sharp voice, languidly showing his brilliant\nwhite teeth and not addressing anyone in particular.\n\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka who was lying below immediately lifted his head and remarked:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey must be going for water.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSupposing one scared them with a gun?\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, laughing,\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they be frightened?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t reach.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Mine would carry beyond. Just wait a bit, and when their feast\ncomes round I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and visit Gir\xc3\xa9y Khan and drink _buza_ there,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka, angrily swishing away the mosquitoes which attached\nthemselves to him.\n\nA rustling in the thicket drew the Cossack\xe2\x80\x99s attention. A pied mongrel\nhalf-setter, searching for a scent and violently wagging its scantily\nfurred tail, came running to the cordon. Luk\xc3\xa1shka recognized the dog as\none belonging to his neighbour, Uncle Er\xc3\xb3shka, a hunter, and saw,\nfollowing it through the thicket, the approaching figure of the hunter\nhimself.\n\nUncle Er\xc3\xb3shka was a gigantic Cossack with a broad, snow-white beard and\nsuch broad shoulders and chest that in the wood, where there was no one\nto compare him with, he did not look particularly tall, so well\nproportioned were his powerful limbs. He wore a tattered coat and, over\nthe bands with which his legs were swathed, sandals made of undressed\ndeer\xe2\x80\x99s hide tied on with strings; while on his head he had a rough\nlittle white cap. He carried over one shoulder a screen to hide behind\nwhen shooting pheasants, and a bag containing a hen for luring hawks,\nand a small falcon; over the other shoulder, attached by a strap, was a\nwild cat he had killed; and stuck in his belt behind were some little\nbags containing bullets, gunpowder, and bread, a horse\xe2\x80\x99s tail to swish\naway the mosquitoes, a large dagger in a torn scabbard smeared with old\nbloodstains, and two dead pheasants. Having glanced at the cordon he\nstopped.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHy, Lyam!\xe2\x80\x9d he called to the dog in such a ringing bass that it awoke\nan echo far away in the wood; and throwing over his shoulder his big\ngun, of the kind the Cossacks call a \xe2\x80\x9cflint\xe2\x80\x9d, he raised his cap.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad a good day, good people, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, addressing the Cossacks in\nthe same strong and cheerful voice, quite without effort, but as loudly\nas if he were shouting to someone on the other bank of the river.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, Uncle!\xe2\x80\x9d answered from all sides the voices of the young\nCossacks.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you seen? Tell us!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Uncle Er\xc3\xb3shka, wiping the sweat\nfrom his broad red face with the sleeve of his coat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, there\xe2\x80\x99s a vulture living in the plane tree here, Uncle. As soon as\nnight comes he begins hovering round,\xe2\x80\x9d said Naz\xc3\xa1rka, winking and\njerking his shoulder and leg.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man incredulously.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, Uncle! You must keep watch,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Naz\xc3\xa1rka with a laugh.\n\nThe other Cossacks began laughing.\n\nThe wag had not seen any vulture at all, but it had long been the\ncustom of the young Cossacks in the cordon to tease and mislead Uncle\nEr\xc3\xb3shka every time he came to them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, you fool, always lying!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Luk\xc3\xa1shka from the tower to\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka.\n\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka was immediately silenced.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be watched. I\xe2\x80\x99ll watch,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the old man to the great\ndelight of all the Cossacks. \xe2\x80\x9cBut have you seen any boars?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWatching for boars, are you?\xe2\x80\x9d said the corporal, bending forward and\nscratching his back with both hands, very pleased at the chance of some\ndistraction. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s _abreks_ one has to hunt here and not boars! You\xe2\x80\x99ve\nnot heard anything, Uncle, have you?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, needlessly screwing up\nhis eyes and showing his close-set white teeth.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Abreks_,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t. I say, have you any\n_chikhir?_ Let me have a drink, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good man. I\xe2\x80\x99m really quite\ndone up. When the time comes I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring you some fresh meat, I really\nwill. Give me a drink!\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and are you going to watch?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the corporal, as though he\nhad not heard what the other said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did mean to watch tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Uncle Er\xc3\xb3shka. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe, with\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s help, I shall kill something for the holiday. Then you shall have\na share, you shall indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle! Hallo, Uncle!\xe2\x80\x9d called out Luk\xc3\xa1shka sharply from above,\nattracting everybody\xe2\x80\x99s attention. All the Cossacks looked up at him.\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust go to the upper water-course, there\xe2\x80\x99s a fine herd of boars there.\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not inventing, really! The other day one of our Cossacks shot one\nthere. I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d added he, readjusting the musket at\nhis back and in a tone that showed he was not joking.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Luk\xc3\xa1shka the Snatcher is here!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, looking up.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere has he been shooting?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you seen? I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99re too young!\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka. \xe2\x80\x9cClose\nby the ditch,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on seriously with a shake of the head. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were\njust going along the ditch when all at once we heard something\ncrackling, but my gun was in its case. Elias fired suddenly ... But\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll show you the place, it\xe2\x80\x99s not far. You just wait a bit. I know\nevery one of their footpaths ... Daddy M\xc3\xb3sev,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, turning\nresolutely and almost commandingly to the corporal, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s time to\nrelieve guard!\xe2\x80\x9d and holding aloft his gun he began to descend from the\nwatch-tower without waiting for the order.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome down!\xe2\x80\x9d said the corporal, after Luk\xc3\xa1shka had started, and glanced\nround. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it your turn, G\xc3\xbarka? Then go ... True enough your Luk\xc3\xa1shka\nhas become very skilful,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, addressing the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cHe keeps\ngoing about just like you, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stay at home. The other day he\nkilled a boar.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n Chapter VII\n\n\nThe sun had already set and the shades of night were rapidly spreading\nfrom the edge of the wood. The Cossacks finished their task round the\ncordon and gathered in the hut for supper. Only the old man still\nstayed under the plane tree watching for the vulture and pulling the\nstring tied to the falcon\xe2\x80\x99s leg, but though a vulture was really\nperching on the plane tree it declined to swoop down on the lure.\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka, singing one song after another, was leisurely placing nets\namong the very thickest brambles to trap pheasants. In spite of his\ntall stature and big hands every kind of work, both rough and delicate,\nprospered under Luk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s fingers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo, Luke!\xe2\x80\x9d came Naz\xc3\xa1rka\xe2\x80\x99s shrill, sharp voice calling him from the\nthicket close by. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Cossacks have gone in to supper.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka, with a live pheasant under his arm, forced his way through the\nbrambles and emerged on the footpath.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, breaking off in his song, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere did you get that\ncock pheasant? I suppose it was in my trap?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka was of the same age as Luk\xc3\xa1shka and had also only been at the\nfront since the previous spring.\n\nHe was plain, thin and puny, with a shrill voice that rang in one\xe2\x80\x99s\nears. They were neighbours and comrades. Luk\xc3\xa1shka was sitting on the\ngrass cross-legged like a Tartar, adjusting his nets.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whose it was\xe2\x80\x94yours, I expect.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it beyond the pit by the plane tree? Then it is mine! I set the\nnets last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka rose and examined the captured pheasant. After stroking the\ndark burnished head of the bird, which rolled its eyes and stretched\nout its neck in terror, Luk\xc3\xa1shka took the pheasant in his hands.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll have it in a pilau tonight. You go and kill and pluck it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd shall we eat it ourselves or give it to the corporal?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has plenty!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like killing them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Naz\xc3\xa1rka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it here!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka drew a little knife from under his dagger and gave it a swift\njerk. The bird fluttered, but before it could spread its wings the\nbleeding head bent and quivered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s how one should do it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, throwing down the\npheasant. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will make a fat pilau.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka shuddered as he looked at the bird.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Luk\xc3\xa1shka, that fiend will be sending us to the ambush again\ntonight,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, taking up the bird. (He was alluding to the\ncorporal.) \xe2\x80\x9cHe has sent F\xc3\xb3mushkin to get wine, and it ought to be his\nturn. He always puts it on us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka went whistling along the cordon.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake the string with you,\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted.\n\nNazirka obeyed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll give him a bit of my mind today, I really will,\xe2\x80\x9d continued\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s say we won\xe2\x80\x99t go; we\xe2\x80\x99re tired out and there\xe2\x80\x99s an end of\nit! No, really, you tell him, he\xe2\x80\x99ll listen to you. It\xe2\x80\x99s too bad!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet along with you! What a thing to make a fuss about!\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka,\nevidently thinking of something else. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat bosh! If he made us turn\nout of the village at night now, that would be annoying: there one can\nhave some fun, but here what is there? It\xe2\x80\x99s all one whether we\xe2\x80\x99re in\nthe cordon or in ambush. What a fellow you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are you going to the village?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go for the holidays.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cG\xc3\xbarka says your Dun\xc3\xa1yka is carrying on with F\xc3\xb3mushkin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Naz\xc3\xa1rka\nsuddenly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let her go to the devil,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, showing his regular\nwhite teeth, though he did not laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cAs if I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find another!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cG\xc3\xbarka says he went to her house. Her husband was out and there was\nF\xc3\xb3mushkin sitting and eating pie. G\xc3\xbarka stopped awhile and then went\naway, and passing by the window he heard her say, \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s gone, the\nfiend.... Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you eat your pie, my own? You needn\xe2\x80\x99t go home for\nthe night,\xe2\x80\x99 she says. And G\xc3\xbarka under the window says to himself,\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s fine!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re making it up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, quite true, by Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if she\xe2\x80\x99s found another let her go to the devil,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka,\nafter a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no lack of girls and I was sick of her anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, see what a devil you are!\xe2\x80\x9d said Naz\xc3\xa1rka. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should make up to\nthe cornet\xe2\x80\x99s girl, Mary\xc3\xa1nka. Why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t she walk out with any one?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka frowned. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat of Mary\xc3\xa1nka? They\xe2\x80\x99re all alike,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you just try...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think? Are girls so scarce in the village?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Luk\xc3\xa1shka recommenced whistling, and went along the cordon pulling\nleaves and branches from the bushes as he went. Suddenly, catching\nsight of a smooth sapling, he drew the knife from the handle of his\ndagger and cut it down. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a ramrod it will make,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, swinging\nthe sapling till it whistled through the air.\n\nThe Cossacks were sitting round a low Tartar table on the earthen floor\nof the clay-plastered outer room of the hut, when the question of whose\nturn it was to lie in ambush was raised. \xe2\x80\x9cWho is to go tonight?\xe2\x80\x9d\nshouted one of the Cossacks through the open door to the corporal in\nthe next room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is to go?\xe2\x80\x9d the corporal shouted back. \xe2\x80\x9cUncle Burl\xc3\xa1k has been and\nF\xc3\xb3mushkin too,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, not quite confidently. \xe2\x80\x9cYou two had better go,\nyou and Naz\xc3\xa1rka,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, addressing Luk\xc3\xa1shka. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Ergush\xc3\xb3v must\ngo too; surely he has slept it off?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t sleep it off yourself so why should he?\xe2\x80\x9d said Naz\xc3\xa1rka in a\nsubdued voice.\n\nThe Cossacks laughed.\n\nErgush\xc3\xb3v was the Cossack who had been lying drunk and asleep near the\nhut. He had only that moment staggered into the room rubbing his eyes.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka had already risen and was getting his gun ready.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe quick and go! Finish your supper and go!\xe2\x80\x9d said the corporal; and\nwithout waiting for an expression of consent he shut the door,\nevidently not expecting the Cossack to obey. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he,\n\xe2\x80\x9cif I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been ordered to I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t send anyone, but an officer\nmight turn up at any moment. As it is, they say eight _abreks_ have\ncrossed over.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I suppose I must go,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Ergush\xc3\xb3v, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s the regulation.\nCan\xe2\x80\x99t be helped! The times are such. I say, we must go.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMeanwhile Luk\xc3\xa1shka, holding a big piece of pheasant to his mouth with\nboth hands and glancing now at Naz\xc3\xa1rka, now at Ergush\xc3\xb3v, seemed quite\nindifferent to what passed and only laughed at them both. Before the\nCossacks were ready to go into ambush. Uncle Er\xc3\xb3shka, who had been\nvainly waiting under the plane tree till night fell, entered the dark\nouter room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, lads,\xe2\x80\x9d his loud bass resounded through the low-roofed room\ndrowning all the other voices, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going with you. You\xe2\x80\x99ll watch for\nCh\xc3\xa9chens and I for boars!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n Chapter VIII\n\n\nIt was quite dark when Uncle Er\xc3\xb3shka and the three Cossacks, in their\ncloaks and shouldering their guns, left the cordon and went towards the\nplace on the T\xc3\xa9rek where they were to lie in ambush. Naz\xc3\xa1rka did not\nwant to go at all, but Luk\xc3\xa1shka shouted at him and they soon started.\nAfter they had gone a few steps in silence the Cossacks turned aside\nfrom the ditch and went along a path almost hidden by reeds till they\nreached the river. On its bank lay a thick black log cast up by the\nwater. The reeds around it had been recently beaten down.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we lie here?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Naz\xc3\xa1rka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d answered Luk\xc3\xa1shka. \xe2\x80\x9cSit down here and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be back in a\nminute. I\xe2\x80\x99ll only show Daddy where to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the best place; here we can see and not be seen,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nErgush\xc3\xb3v, \xe2\x80\x9cso it\xe2\x80\x99s here we\xe2\x80\x99ll lie. It\xe2\x80\x99s a first-rate place!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka and Ergush\xc3\xb3v spread out their cloaks and settled down behind\nthe log, while Luk\xc3\xa1shka went on with Uncle Er\xc3\xb3shka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not far from here. Daddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, stepping softly in\nfront of the old man; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll show you where they\xe2\x80\x99ve been\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m the only\none that knows, Daddy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow me! You\xe2\x80\x99re a fine fellow, a regular Snatcher!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old\nman, also whispering.\n\nHaving gone a few steps Luk\xc3\xa1shka stopped, stooped down over a puddle,\nand whistled. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s where they come to drink, d\xe2\x80\x99you see?\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke in\na scarcely audible voice, pointing to fresh hoof-prints.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cChrist bless you,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cThe boar will be in the\nhollow beyond the ditch,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll watch, and you can go.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka pulled his cloak up higher and walked back alone, throwing\nswift glances now to the left at the wall of reeds, now to the T\xc3\xa9rek\nrushing by below the bank. \xe2\x80\x9cI daresay he\xe2\x80\x99s watching or creeping along\nsomewhere,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he of a possible Ch\xc3\xa9chen hillsman. Suddenly a loud\nrustling and a splash in the water made him start and seize his musket.\nFrom under the bank a boar leapt up\xe2\x80\x94his dark outline showing for a\nmoment against the glassy surface of the water and then disappearing\namong the reeds. Luk\xc3\xa1shka pulled out his gun and aimed, but before he\ncould fire the boar had disappeared in the thicket. Luk\xc3\xa1shka spat with\nvexation and went on. On approaching the ambuscade he halted again and\nwhistled softly. His whistle was answered and he stepped up to his\ncomrades.\n\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka, all curled up, was already asleep. Ergush\xc3\xb3v sat with his legs\ncrossed and moved slightly to make room for Luk\xc3\xa1shka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow jolly it is to sit here! It\xe2\x80\x99s really a good place,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cDid\nyou take him there?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShowed him where,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Luk\xc3\xa1shka, spreading out his cloak. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\nwhat a big boar I roused just now close to the water! I expect it was\nthe very one! You must have heard the crash?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did hear a beast crashing through. I knew at once it was a beast. I\nthought to myself: \xe2\x80\x98Luk\xc3\xa1shka has roused a beast,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Ergush\xc3\xb3v said,\nwrapping himself up in his cloak. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWake me when the cocks crow. We must have discipline. I\xe2\x80\x99ll lie down\nand have a nap, and then you will have a nap and I\xe2\x80\x99ll watch\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the\nway.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLuckily I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Luk\xc3\xa1shka.\n\nThe night was dark, warm, and still. Only on one side of the sky the\nstars were shining, the other and greater part was overcast by one huge\ncloud stretching from the mountaintops. The black cloud, blending in\nthe absence of any wind with the mountains, moved slowly onwards, its\ncurved edges sharply defined against the deep starry sky. Only in front\nof him could the Cossack discern the T\xc3\xa9rek and the distance beyond.\nBehind and on both sides he was surrounded by a wall of reeds.\nOccasionally the reeds would sway and rustle against one another\napparently without cause. Seen from down below, against the clear part\nof the sky, their waving tufts looked like the feathery branches of\ntrees. Close in front at his very feet was the bank, and at its base\nthe rushing torrent. A little farther on was the moving mass of glassy\nbrown water which eddied rhythmically along the bank and round the\nshallows. Farther still, water, banks, and cloud all merged together in\nimpenetrable gloom. Along the surface of the water floated black\nshadows, in which the experienced eyes of the Cossack detected trees\ncarried down by the current. Only very rarely sheet-lightning, mirrored\nin the water as in a black glass, disclosed the sloping bank opposite.\nThe rhythmic sounds of night\xe2\x80\x94the rustling of the reeds, the snoring of\nthe Cossacks, the hum of mosquitoes, and the rushing water, were every\nnow and then broken by a shot fired in the distance, or by the gurgling\nof water when a piece of bank slipped down, the splash of a big fish,\nor the crashing of an animal breaking through the thick undergrowth in\nthe wood. Once an owl flew past along the T\xc3\xa9rek, flapping one wing\nagainst the other rhythmically at every second beat. Just above the\nCossack\xe2\x80\x99s head it turned towards the wood and then, striking its wings\nno longer after every other flap but at every flap, it flew to an old\nplane tree where it rustled about for a long time before settling down\namong the branches. At every one of these unexpected sounds the\nwatching Cossack listened intently, straining his hearing, and screwing\nup his eyes while he deliberately felt for his musket.\n\nThe greater part of the night was past. The black cloud that had moved\nwestward revealed the clear starry sky from under its torn edge, and\nthe golden upturned crescent of the moon shone above the mountains with\na reddish light. The cold began to be penetrating. Naz\xc3\xa1rka awoke, spoke\na little, and fell asleep again. Luk\xc3\xa1shka feeling bored got up, drew\nthe knife from his dagger-handle and began to fashion his stick into a\nramrod. His head was full of the Ch\xc3\xa9chens who lived over there in the\nmountains, and of how their brave lads came across and were not afraid\nof the Cossacks, and might even now be crossing the river at some other\nspot. He thrust himself out of his hiding-place and looked along the\nriver but could see nothing. And as he continued looking out at\nintervals upon the river and at the opposite bank, now dimly\ndistinguishable from the water in the faint moonlight, he no longer\nthought about the Ch\xc3\xa9chens but only of when it would be time to wake\nhis comrades, and of going home to the village. In the village he\nimagined Dun\xc3\xa1yka, his \xe2\x80\x9clittle soul\xe2\x80\x9d, as the Cossacks call a man\xe2\x80\x99s\nmistress, and thought of her with vexation. Silvery mists, a sign of\ncoming morning, glittered white above the water, and not far from him\nyoung eagles were whistling and flapping their wings. At last the\ncrowing of a cock reached him from the distant village, followed by the\nlong-sustained note of another, which was again answered by yet other\nvoices.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTime to wake them,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Luk\xc3\xa1shka, who had finished his ramrod and\nfelt his eyes growing heavy. Turning to his comrades he managed to make\nout which pair of legs belonged to whom, when it suddenly seemed to him\nthat he heard something splash on the other side of the T\xc3\xa9rek. He\nturned again towards the horizon beyond the hills, where day was\nbreaking under the upturned crescent, glanced at the outline of the\nopposite bank, at the T\xc3\xa9rek, and at the now distinctly visible\ndriftwood upon it. For one instant it seemed to him that he was moving\nand that the T\xc3\xa9rek with the drifting wood remained stationary. Again he\npeered out. One large black log with a branch particularly attracted\nhis attention. The tree was floating in a strange way right down the\nmiddle of the stream, neither rocking nor whirling. It even appeared\nnot to be floating altogether with the current, but to be crossing it\nin the direction of the shallows. Luk\xc3\xa1shka stretching out his neck\nwatched it intently. The tree floated to the shallows, stopped, and\nshifted in a peculiar manner. Luk\xc3\xa1shka thought he saw an arm stretched\nout from beneath the tree.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSupposing I killed an _abrek_ all by myself!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, and seized\nhis gun with a swift, unhurried movement, putting up his gun-rest,\nplacing the gun upon it, and holding it noiselessly in position.\nCocking the trigger, with bated breath he took aim, still peering out\nintently.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t wake them,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. But his heart began beating so fast\nthat he remained motionless, listening. Suddenly the trunk gave a\nplunge and again began to float across the stream towards our bank.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose I miss?...\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, and now by the faint light of the moon\nhe caught a glimpse of a Tartar\xe2\x80\x99s head in front of the floating wood.\nHe aimed straight at the head which appeared to be quite near\xe2\x80\x94just at\nthe end of his rifle\xe2\x80\x99s barrel. He glanced cross. \xe2\x80\x9cRight enough it is an\n_abrek!_\xe2\x80\x9d he thought joyfully, and suddenly rising to his knees he\nagain took aim. Having found the sight, barely visible at the end of\nthe long gun, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the name of the Father and of the Son,\xe2\x80\x9d in\nthe Cossack way learnt in his childhood, and pulled the trigger. A\nflash of lightning lit up for an instant the reeds and the water, and\nthe sharp, abrupt report of the shot was carried across the river,\nchanging into a prolonged roll somewhere in the far distance. The piece\nof driftwood now floated not across, but with the current, rocking and\nwhirling.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, I say!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Ergush\xc3\xb3v, seizing his musket and raising\nhimself behind the log near which he was lying.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut up, you devil!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Luk\xc3\xa1shka, grinding his teeth.\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Abreks!_\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhom have you shot?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Naz\xc3\xa1rka. \xe2\x80\x9cWho was it, Luk\xc3\xa1shka?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka did not answer. He was reloading his gun and watching the\nfloating wood. A little way off it stopped on a sand-bank, and from\nbehind it something large that rocked in the water came into view.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you shoot? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you speak?\xe2\x80\x9d insisted the Cossacks.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Abreks_, I tell you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t humbug! Did the gun go off? ...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve killed an _abrek_, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I fired at,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Luk\xc3\xa1shka in\na voice choked by emotion, as he jumped to his feet. \xe2\x80\x9cA man was\nswimming...\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pointing to the sandbank. \xe2\x80\x9cI killed him. Just\nlook there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave done with your humbugging!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ergush\xc3\xb3v again, rubbing his\neyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave done with what? Look there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, seizing him by the\nshoulders and pulling him with such force that Ergush\xc3\xb3v groaned.\n\nHe looked in the direction in which Luk\xc3\xa1shka pointed, and discerning a\nbody immediately changed his tone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Lord! But I say, more will come! I tell you the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d said he\nsoftly, and began examining his musket. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was a scout swimming\nacross: either the others are here already or are not far off on the\nother side\xe2\x80\x94I tell you for sure!\xe2\x80\x9d Luk\xc3\xa1shka was unfastening his belt and\ntaking off his Circassian coat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you up to, you idiot?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Ergush\xc3\xb3v. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly show\nyourself and you\xe2\x80\x99ve lost all for nothing, I tell you true! If you\xe2\x80\x99ve\nkilled him he won\xe2\x80\x99t escape. Let me have a little powder for my\nmusket-pan\xe2\x80\x94you have some? Naz\xc3\xa1rka, you go back to the cordon and look\nalive; but don\xe2\x80\x99t go along the bank or you\xe2\x80\x99ll be killed\xe2\x80\x94I tell you\ntrue.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCatch me going alone! Go yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d said Naz\xc3\xa1rka angrily.\n\nHaving taken off his coat, Luk\xc3\xa1shka went down to the bank.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go in, I tell you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ergush\xc3\xb3v, putting some powder on the\npan. \xe2\x80\x9cLook, he\xe2\x80\x99s not moving. I can see. It\xe2\x80\x99s nearly morning; wait till\nthey come from the cordon. You go, Naz\xc3\xa1rka. You\xe2\x80\x99re afraid! Don\xe2\x80\x99t be\nafraid, I tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLuke, I say, Luk\xc3\xa1shka! Tell us how you did it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Naz\xc3\xa1rka.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka changed his mind about going into the water just then. \xe2\x80\x9cGo\nquick to the cordon and I will watch. Tell the Cossacks to send out the\npatrol. If the _abreks_ are on this side they must be caught,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I say. They\xe2\x80\x99ll get off,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ergush\xc3\xb3v, rising. \xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\nthey must be caught!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nErgush\xc3\xb3v and Naz\xc3\xa1rka rose and, crossing themselves, started off for the\ncordon\xe2\x80\x94not along the riverbank but breaking their way through the\nbrambles to reach a path in the wood.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow mind, Luk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x94they may cut you down here, so you\xe2\x80\x99d best keep a\nsharp look-out, I tell you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo along; I know,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Luk\xc3\xa1shka; and having examined his gun\nagain he sat down behind the log.\n\nHe remained alone and sat gazing at the shallows and listening for the\nCossacks; but it was some distance to the cordon and he was tormented\nby impatience. He kept thinking that the other _abreks_ who were with\nthe one he had killed would escape. He was vexed with the _abreks_ who\nwere going to escape just as he had been with the boar that had escaped\nthe evening before. He glanced round and at the opposite bank,\nexpecting every moment to see a man, and having arranged his gun-rest\nhe was ready to fire. The idea that he might himself be killed never\nentered his head.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter IX\n\n\nIt was growing light. The Ch\xc3\xa9chen\xe2\x80\x99s body which was gently rocking in\nthe shallow water was now clearly visible. Suddenly the reeds rustled\nnot far from Luke and he heard steps and saw the feathery tops of the\nreeds moving. He set his gun at full cock and muttered: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the name of\nthe Father and of the Son,\xe2\x80\x9d but when the cock clicked the sound of\nsteps ceased.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo, Cossacks! Don\xe2\x80\x99t kill your Daddy!\xe2\x80\x9d said a deep bass voice\ncalmly; and moving the reeds apart Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka came up close to Luke.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI very nearly killed you, by God I did!\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you shot?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the old man.\n\nHis sonorous voice resounded through the wood and downward along the\nriver, suddenly dispelling the mysterious quiet of night around the\nCossack. It was as if everything had suddenly become lighter and more\ndistinct.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now. Uncle, you have not seen anything, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve killed a\nbeast,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, uncocking his gun and getting up with unnatural\ncalmness.\n\nThe old man was staring intently at the white back, now clearly\nvisible, against which the T\xc3\xa9rek rippled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was swimming with a log on his back. I spied him out! ... Look\nthere. There! He\xe2\x80\x99s got blue trousers, and a gun I think.... Do you\nsee?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Luke.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can one help seeing?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man angrily, and a serious and\nstern expression appeared on his face. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve killed a brave,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid, apparently with regret.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I sat here and suddenly saw something dark on the other side. I\nspied him when he was still over there. It was as if a man had come\nthere and fallen in. Strange! And a piece of driftwood, a good-sized\npiece, comes floating, not with the stream but across it; and what do I\nsee but a head appearing from under it! Strange! I stretched out of the\nreeds but could see nothing; then I rose and he must have heard, the\nbeast, and crept out into the shallow and looked about. \xe2\x80\x98No, you\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99 I said, as soon as he landed and looked round, \xe2\x80\x98you won\xe2\x80\x99t get\naway!\xe2\x80\x99 Oh, there was something choking me! I got my gun ready but did\nnot stir, and looked out. He waited a little and then swam out again;\nand when he came into the moonlight I could see his whole back. \xe2\x80\x98In the\nname of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost\xe2\x80\x99... and through\nthe smoke I see him struggling. He moaned, or so it seemed to me. \xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99\nI thought, \xe2\x80\x98the Lord be thanked, I\xe2\x80\x99ve killed him!\xe2\x80\x99 And when he drifted\nonto the sand-bank I could see him distinctly: he tried to get up but\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. He struggled a bit and then lay down. Everything could be\nseen. Look, he does not move\xe2\x80\x94he must be dead! The Cossacks have gone\nback to the cordon in case there should be any more of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you got him!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is far away now, my lad!\n...\xe2\x80\x9d And again he shook his head sadly.\n\nJust then the sound reached them of breaking bushes and the loud voices\nof Cossacks approaching along the bank on horseback and on foot. \xe2\x80\x9cAre\nyou bringing the skiff?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Luk\xc3\xa1shka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a trump, Luke! Lug it to the bank!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted one of the\nCossacks.\n\nWithout waiting for the skiff Luk\xc3\xa1shka began to undress, keeping an eye\nall the while on his prey.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit, Naz\xc3\xa1rka is bringing the skiff,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the corporal.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou fool! Maybe he is alive and only pretending! Take your dagger with\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted another Cossack.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet along,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Luke, pulling off his trousers. He quickly undressed\nand, crossing himself, jumped, plunging with a splash into the river.\nThen with long strokes of his white arms, lifting his back high out of\nthe water and breathing deeply, he swam across the current of the T\xc3\xa9rek\ntowards the shallows. A crowd of Cossacks stood on the bank talking\nloudly. Three horsemen rode off to patrol. The skiff appeared round a\nbend. Luk\xc3\xa1shka stood up on the sandbank, leaned over the body, and gave\nit a couple of shakes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite dead!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted in a shrill voice.\n\nThe Ch\xc3\xa9chen had been shot in the head. He had on a pair of blue\ntrousers, a shirt, and a Circassian coat, and a gun and dagger were\ntied to his back. Above all these a large branch was tied, and it was\nthis which at first had misled Luk\xc3\xa1shka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a carp you\xe2\x80\x99ve landed!\xe2\x80\x9d cried one of the Cossacks who had\nassembled in a circle, as the body, lifted out of the skiff, was laid\non the bank, pressing down the grass.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow yellow he is!\xe2\x80\x9d said another.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere have our fellows gone to search? I expect the rest of them are\non the other bank. If this one had not been a scout he would not have\nswum that way. Why else should he swim alone?\xe2\x80\x9d said a third.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust have been a smart one to offer himself before the others; a\nregular brave!\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka mockingly, shivering as he wrung out his\nclothes that had got wet on the bank.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis beard is dyed and cropped.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he has tied a bag with a coat in it to his back.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would make it easier for him to swim,\xe2\x80\x9d said some one.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Luk\xc3\xa1shka,\xe2\x80\x9d said the corporal, who was holding the dagger and\ngun taken from the dead man. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep the dagger for yourself and the coat\ntoo; but I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you three rubles for the gun. You see it has a hole\nin it,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, blowing into the muzzle. \xe2\x80\x9cI want it just for a\nsouvenir.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka did not answer. Evidently this sort of begging vexed him but\nhe knew it could not be avoided.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, what a devil!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, frowning and throwing down the Ch\xc3\xa9chen\xe2\x80\x99s\ncoat. \xe2\x80\x9cIf at least it were a good coat, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a mere rag.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll do to fetch firewood in,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the Cossacks.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cM\xc3\xb3sev, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, evidently forgetting his vexation\nand wishing to get some advantage out of having to give a present to\nhis superior.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, you may go!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake the body beyond the cordon, lads,\xe2\x80\x9d said the corporal, still\nexamining the gun, \xe2\x80\x9cand put a shelter over him from the sun. Perhaps\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ll send from the mountains to ransom it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t hot yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said someone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd supposing a jackal tears him? Would that be well?\xe2\x80\x9d remarked\nanother Cossack.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll set a watch; if they should come to ransom him it won\xe2\x80\x99t do for\nhim to have been torn.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Luk\xc3\xa1shka, whatever you do you must stand a pail of vodka for the\nlads,\xe2\x80\x9d said the corporal gaily.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course! That\xe2\x80\x99s the custom,\xe2\x80\x9d chimed in the Cossacks. \xe2\x80\x9cSee what luck\nGod has sent you! Without ever having seen anything of the kind before,\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve killed a brave!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBuy the dagger and coat and don\xe2\x80\x99t be stingy, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you have the\ntrousers too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re too tight for me; he was a thin\ndevil.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOne Cossack bought the coat for a ruble and another gave the price of\ntwo pails of vodka for the dagger.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrink, lads! I\xe2\x80\x99ll stand you a pail!\xe2\x80\x9d said Luke. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll bring it myself\nfrom the village.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd cut up the trousers into kerchiefs for the girls!\xe2\x80\x9d said Naz\xc3\xa1rka.\n\nThe Cossacks burst out laughing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave done laughing!\xe2\x80\x9d said the corporal. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd take the body away. Why\nhave you put the nasty thing by the hut?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you standing there for? Haul him along, lads!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka in a commanding voice to the Cossacks, who reluctantly took\nhold of the body, obeying him as though he were their chief. After\ndragging the body along for a few steps the Cossacks let fall the legs,\nwhich dropped with a lifeless jerk, and stepping apart they then stood\nsilent for a few moments. Naz\xc3\xa1rka came up and straightened the head,\nwhich was turned to one side so that the round wound above the temple\nand the whole of the dead man\xe2\x80\x99s face were visible. \xe2\x80\x9cSee what a mark he\nhas made right in the brain,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe won\xe2\x80\x99t get lost. His owners\nwill always know him!\xe2\x80\x9d No one answered, and again the Angel of Silence\nflew over the Cossacks.\n\nThe sun had risen high and its diverging beams were lighting up the\ndewy grass. Near by, the T\xc3\xa9rek murmured in the awakened wood and,\ngreeting the morning, the pheasants called to one another. The Cossacks\nstood still and silent around the dead man, gazing at him. The brown\nbody, with nothing on but the wet blue trousers held by a girdle over\nthe sunken stomach, was well shaped and handsome. The muscular arms lay\nstretched straight out by his sides; the blue, freshly shaven, round\nhead with the clotted wound on one side of it was thrown back. The\nsmooth tanned forehead contrasted sharply with the shaven part of the\nhead. The open glassy eyes with lowered pupils stared upwards, seeming\nto gaze past everything. Under the red trimmed moustache the fine lips,\ndrawn at the corners, seemed stiffened into a smile of good-natured\nsubtle raillery. The fingers of the small hands covered with red hairs\nwere bent inward, and the nails were dyed red.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka had not yet dressed. He was wet. His neck was redder and his\neyes brighter than usual, his broad jaws twitched, and from his healthy\nbody a hardly perceptible steam rose in the fresh morning air.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe too was a man!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, evidently admiring the corpse.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if you had fallen into his hands you would have had short\nshrift,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the Cossacks.\n\nThe Angel of Silence had taken wing. The Cossacks began bustling about\nand talking. Two of them went to cut brushwood for a shelter, others\nstrolled towards the cordon. Luke and Naz\xc3\xa1rka ran to get ready to go to\nthe village.\n\nHalf an hour later they were both on their way homewards, talking\nincessantly and almost running through the dense woods which separated\nthe T\xc3\xa9rek from the village.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell her I sent you, but just go and find out if her\nhusband is at home,\xe2\x80\x9d Luke was saying in his shrill voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ll go round to Y\xc3\xa1mka too,\xe2\x80\x9d said the devoted Naz\xc3\xa1rka. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll have\na spree, shall we?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen should we have one if not today?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Luke.\n\nWhen they reached the village the two Cossacks drank, and lay down to\nsleep till evening.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter X\n\n\nOn the third day after the events above described, two companies of a\nCaucasian infantry regiment arrived at the Cossack village of\nNovoml\xc3\xadnsk. The horses had been unharnessed and the companies\xe2\x80\x99 wagons\nwere standing in the square. The cooks had dug a pit, and with logs\ngathered from various yards (where they had not been sufficiently\nsecurely stored) were now cooking the food; the pay-sergeants were\nsettling accounts with the soldiers. The Service Corps men were driving\npiles in the ground to which to tie the horses, and the quartermasters\nwere going about the streets just as if they were at home, showing\nofficers and men to their quarters. Here were green ammunition boxes in\na line, the company\xe2\x80\x99s carts, horses, and cauldrons in which buckwheat\nporridge was being cooked.\n\nHere were the captain and the lieutenant and the sergeant-major, Onisim\nMikh\xc3\xa1ylovich, and all this was in the Cossack village where it was\nreported that the companies were ordered to take up their quarters:\ntherefore they were at home here.\n\nBut why they were stationed there, who the Cossacks were, and whether\nthey wanted the troops to be there, and whether they were Old Believers\nor not\xe2\x80\x94was all quite immaterial. Having received their pay and been\ndismissed, tired out and covered with dust, the soldiers noisily and in\ndisorder, like a swarm of bees about to settle, spread over the squares\nand streets.\n\nQuite regardless of the Cossacks\xe2\x80\x99 ill will, chattering merrily and with\ntheir muskets clinking, by twos and threes they entered the huts and\nhung up their accoutrements, unpacked their bags, and bantered the\nwomen. At their favourite spot, round the porridge-cauldrons, a large\ngroup of soldiers assembled and with little pipes between their teeth\nthey gazed, now at the smoke which rose into the hot sky, becoming\nvisible when it thickened into white clouds as it rose, and now at the\ncamp fires which were quivering in the pure air like molten glass, and\nbantered and made fun of the Cossack men and women because they do not\nlive at all like Russians. In all the yards one could see soldiers and\nhear their laughter and the exasperated and shrill cries of Cossack\nwomen defending their houses and refusing to give the soldiers water or\ncooking utensils. Little boys and girls, clinging to their mothers and\nto each other, followed all the movements of the troopers (never before\nseen by them) with frightened curiosity, or ran after them at a\nrespectful distance.\n\nThe old Cossacks came out silently and dismally and sat on the earthen\nembankments of their huts, and watched the soldiers\xe2\x80\x99 activity with an\nair of leaving it all to the will of God without understanding what\nwould come of it.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin, who had joined the Caucasian Army as a cadet three months\nbefore, was quartered in one of the best houses in the village, the\nhouse of the cornet, Elias Vas\xc3\xadlich\xe2\x80\x94that is to say at Granny Ul\xc3\xadtka\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness knows what it will be like, Dm\xc3\xadtri Andr\xc3\xa9ich,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\npanting Vany\xc3\xbasha to Ol\xc3\xa9nin, who, dressed in a Circassian coat and\nmounted on a Kabard\xc3\xa1 horse which he had bought in Gr\xc3\xb3znoe, was after a\nfive-hours\xe2\x80\x99 march gaily entering the yard of the quarters assigned to\nhim.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, caressing his horse and looking\nmerrily at the perspiring, dishevelled, and worried Vany\xc3\xbasha, who had\narrived with the baggage wagons and was unpacking.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin looked quite a different man. In place of his clean-shaven lips\nand chin he had a youthful moustache and a small beard. Instead of a\nsallow complexion, the result of nights turned into day, his cheeks,\nhis forehead, and the skin behind his ears were now red with healthy\nsunburn. In place of a clean new black suit he wore a dirty white\nCircassian coat with a deeply pleated skirt, and he bore arms. Instead\nof a freshly starched collar, his neck was tightly clasped by the red\nband of his silk _beshmet_. He wore Circassian dress but did not wear\nit well, and anyone would have known him for a Russian and not a Tartar\nbrave. It was the thing\xe2\x80\x94but not the real thing. But for all that, his\nwhole person breathed health, joy, and satisfaction.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it seems funny to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vany\xc3\xbasha, \xe2\x80\x9cbut just try to talk to\nthese people yourself: they set themselves against one and there\xe2\x80\x99s an\nend of it. You can\xe2\x80\x99t get as much as a word out of them.\xe2\x80\x9d Vany\xc3\xbasha\nangrily threw down a pail on the threshold. \xe2\x80\x9cSomehow they don\xe2\x80\x99t seem\nlike Russians.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should speak to the Chief of the Village!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where he lives,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vany\xc3\xbasha in an offended tone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho has upset you so?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin, looking round.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil only knows. Faugh! There is no real master here. They say he\nhas gone to some kind of _kriga_, and the old woman is a real devil.\nGod preserve us!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Vany\xc3\xbasha, putting his hands to his head.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow we shall live here I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. They are worse than Tartars, I do\ndeclare\xe2\x80\x94though they consider themselves Christians! A Tartar is bad\nenough, but all the same he is more noble. Gone to the _kriga_ indeed!\nWhat this _kriga_ they have invented is, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know!\xe2\x80\x9d concluded\nVany\xc3\xbasha, and turned aside.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not as it is in the serfs\xe2\x80\x99 quarters at home, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d chaffed Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nwithout dismounting.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease sir, may I have your horse?\xe2\x80\x9d said Vany\xc3\xbasha, evidently perplexed\nby this new order of things but resigning himself to his fate.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo a Tartar is more noble, eh, Vany\xc3\xbasha?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Ol\xc3\xa9nin, dismounting\nand slapping the saddle.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you\xe2\x80\x99re laughing! You think it funny,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Vany\xc3\xbasha angrily.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, don\xe2\x80\x99t be angry, Vany\xc3\xbasha,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ol\xc3\xa9nin, still smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cWait\na minute, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and speak to the people of the house; you\xe2\x80\x99ll see I\nshall arrange everything. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a jolly life we shall\nhave here. Only don\xe2\x80\x99t get upset.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nVany\xc3\xbasha did not answer. Screwing up his eyes he looked contemptuously\nafter his master, and shook his head. Vany\xc3\xbasha regarded Ol\xc3\xa9nin as only\nhis master, and Ol\xc3\xa9nin regarded Vany\xc3\xbasha as only his servant; and they\nwould both have been much surprised if anyone had told them that they\nwere friends, as they really were without knowing it themselves.\nVany\xc3\xbasha had been taken into his proprietor\xe2\x80\x99s house when he was only\neleven and when Ol\xc3\xa9nin was the same age. When Ol\xc3\xa9nin was fifteen he\ngave Vany\xc3\xbasha lessons for a time and taught him to read French, of\nwhich the latter was inordinately proud; and when in specially good\nspirits he still let off French words, always laughing stupidly when he\ndid so.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin ran up the steps of the porch and pushed open the door of the\nhut. Mary\xc3\xa1nka, wearing nothing but a pink smock, as all Cossack women\ndo in the house, jumped away from the door, frightened, and pressing\nherself against the wall covered the lower part of her face with the\nbroad sleeve of her Tartar smock. Having opened the door wider, Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nin the semi-darkness of the passage saw the whole tall, shapely figure\nof the young Cossack girl. With the quick and eager curiosity of youth\nhe involuntarily noticed the firm maidenly form revealed by the fine\nprint smock, and the beautiful black eyes fixed on him with childlike\nterror and wild curiosity.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is _she_,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Ol\xc3\xa9nin. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there will be many others like\nher\xe2\x80\x9d came at once into his head, and he opened the inner door.\n\nOld Granny Ul\xc3\xadtka, also dressed only in a smock, was stooping with her\nback turned to him, sweeping the floor.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-day to you. Mother! I\xe2\x80\x99ve come about my lodgings,\xe2\x80\x9d he began.\n\nThe Cossack woman, without unbending, turned her severe but still\nhandsome face towards him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you come here for? Want to mock at us, eh? I\xe2\x80\x99ll teach you to\nmock; may the black plague seize you!\xe2\x80\x9d she shouted, looking askance\nfrom under her frowning brow at the new-comer.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin had at first imagined that the way-worn, gallant Caucasian Army\n(of which he was a member) would be everywhere received joyfully, and\nespecially by the Cossacks, our comrades in the war; and he therefore\nfelt perplexed by this reception. Without losing presence of mind\nhowever he tried to explain that he meant to pay for his lodgings, but\nthe old woman would not give him a hearing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you come for? Who wants a pest like you, with your scraped\nface? You just wait a bit; when the master returns he\xe2\x80\x99ll show you your\nplace. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want your dirty money! A likely thing\xe2\x80\x94just as if we had\nnever seen any! You\xe2\x80\x99ll stink the house out with your beastly tobacco\nand want to put it right with money! Think we\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen a pest! May\nyou be shot in your bowels and your heart!\xe2\x80\x9d shrieked the old woman in a\npiercing voice, interrupting Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems Vany\xc3\xbasha was right!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Ol\xc3\xa9nin. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98A Tartar would be\nnobler\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d and followed by Granny Ul\xc3\xadtka\xe2\x80\x99s abuse he went out of the hut.\nAs he was leaving, Mary\xc3\xa1nka, still wearing only her pink smock, but\nwith her forehead covered down to her eyes by a white kerchief,\nsuddenly slipped out from the passage past him. Pattering rapidly down\nthe steps with her bare feet she ran from the porch, stopped, and\nlooking round hastily with laughing eyes at the young man, vanished\nround the corner of the hut.\n\nHer firm youthful step, the untamed look of the eyes glistening from\nunder the white kerchief, and the firm stately build of the young\nbeauty, struck Ol\xc3\xa9nin even more powerfully than before. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, it must\nbe _she_,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, and troubling his head still less about the\nlodgings, he kept looking round at Mary\xc3\xa1nka as he approached Vany\xc3\xbasha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere you see, the girl too is quite savage, just like a wild filly!\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Vany\xc3\xbasha, who though still busy with the luggage wagon had now\ncheered up a bit. \xe2\x80\x9c_La fame!_\xe2\x80\x9d he added in a loud triumphant voice and\nburst out laughing.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XI\n\n\nTowards evening the master of the house returned from his fishing, and\nhaving learnt that the cadet would pay for the lodging, pacified the\nold woman and satisfied Vany\xc3\xbasha\xe2\x80\x99s demands.\n\nEverything was arranged in the new quarters. Their hosts moved into the\nwinter hut and let their summer hut to the cadet for three rubles a\nmonth. Ol\xc3\xa9nin had something to eat and went to sleep. Towards evening\nhe woke up, washed and made himself tidy, dined, and having lit a\ncigarette sat down by the window that looked onto the street. It was\ncooler. The slanting shadow of the hut with its ornamental gables fell\nacross the dusty road and even bent upwards at the base of the wall of\nthe house opposite. The steep reed-thatched roof of that house shone in\nthe rays of the setting sun. The air grew fresher. Everything was\npeaceful in the village. The soldiers had settled down and become\nquiet. The herds had not yet been driven home and the people had not\nreturned from their work.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s lodging was situated almost at the end of the village. At rare\nintervals, from somewhere far beyond the T\xc3\xa9rek in those parts whence\nOl\xc3\xa9nin had just come (the Ch\xc3\xa9chen or the Kum\xc3\xbdtsk plain), came muffled\nsounds of firing. Ol\xc3\xa9nin was feeling very well contented after three\nmonths of bivouac life. His newly washed face was fresh and his\npowerful body clean (an unaccustomed sensation after the campaign) and\nin all his rested limbs he was conscious of a feeling of tranquillity\nand strength. His mind, too, felt fresh and clear. He thought of the\ncampaign and of past dangers. He remembered that he had faced them no\nworse than other men, and that he was accepted as a comrade among\nvaliant Caucasians. His Moscow recollections were left behind Heaven\nknows how far! The old life was wiped out and a quite new life had\nbegun in which there were as yet no mistakes. Here as a new man among\nnew men he could gain a new and good reputation. He was conscious of a\nyouthful and unreasoning joy of life. Looking now out of the window at\nthe boys spinning their tops in the shadow of the house, now round his\nneat new lodging, he thought how pleasantly he would settle down to\nthis new Cossack village life. Now and then he glanced at the mountains\nand the blue sky, and an appreciation of the solemn grandeur of nature\nmingled with his reminiscences and dreams. His new life had begun, not\nas he imagined it would when he left Moscow, but unexpectedly well.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe mountains, the mountains, the mountains!\xe2\x80\x9d they permeated all his\nthoughts and feelings.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s kissed his dog and licked the jug! ... Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka has kissed\nhis dog!\xe2\x80\x9d suddenly the little Cossacks who had been spinning their tops\nunder the window shouted, looking towards the side street. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s drunk\nhis bitch, and his dagger!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the boys, crowding together and\nstepping backwards.\n\nThese shouts were addressed to Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka, who with his gun on his\nshoulder and some pheasants hanging at his girdle was returning from\nhis shooting expedition.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have done wrong, lads, I have!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, vigorously swinging his\narms and looking up at the windows on both sides of the street. \xe2\x80\x9cI have\ndrunk the bitch; it was wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, evidently vexed but\npretending not to care.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin was surprised by the boys\xe2\x80\x99 behavior towards the old hunter, but\nwas still more struck by the expressive, intelligent face and the\npowerful build of the man whom they called Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere Daddy, here Cossack!\xe2\x80\x9d he called. \xe2\x80\x9cCome here!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old man looked into the window and stopped.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood evening, good man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, lifting his little cap off his\ncropped head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood evening, good man,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ol\xc3\xa9nin. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it the youngsters\nare shouting at you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDaddy Er\xc3\xb3shka came up to the window. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, they\xe2\x80\x99re teasing the old man.\nNo matter, I like it. Let them joke about their old daddy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\nwith those firm musical intonations with which old and venerable people\nspeak. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you an army commander?\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am a cadet. But where did you kill those pheasants?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\nOl\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dispatched these three hens in the forest,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the old man,\nturning his broad back towards the window to show the hen pheasants\nwhich were hanging with their heads tucked into his belt and staining\nhis coat with blood. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you seen any?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cTake a brace if\nyou like! Here you are,\xe2\x80\x9d and he handed two of the pheasants in at the\nwindow. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you a sportsman yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am. During the campaign I killed four myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour? What a lot!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man sarcastically. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd are you a\ndrinker? Do you drink _chikhir?_\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? I like a drink.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I see you are a trump! We shall be _kunaks_, you and I,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nDaddy Er\xc3\xb3shka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStep in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll have a drop of _chikhir_.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might as well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, \xe2\x80\x9cbut take the pheasants.\xe2\x80\x9d The old\nman\xe2\x80\x99s face showed that he liked the cadet. He had seen at once that he\ncould get free drinks from him, and that therefore it would be all\nright to give him a brace of pheasants.\n\nSoon Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka\xe2\x80\x99s figure appeared in the doorway of the hut, and it\nwas only then that Ol\xc3\xa9nin became fully conscious of the enormous size\nand sturdy build of this man, whose red-brown face with its perfectly\nwhite broad beard was all furrowed by deep lines produced by age and\ntoil. For an old man, the muscles of his legs, arms, and shoulders were\nquite exceptionally large and prominent. There were deep scars on his\nhead under the short-cropped hair. His thick sinewy neck was covered\nwith deep intersecting folds like a bull\xe2\x80\x99s. His horny hands were\nbruised and scratched. He stepped lightly and easily over the\nthreshold, unslung his gun and placed it in a corner, and casting a\nrapid glance round the room noted the value of the goods and chattels\ndeposited in the hut, and with out-turned toes stepped softly, in his\nsandals of raw hide, into the middle of the room. He brought with him a\npenetrating but not unpleasant smell of _chikhir_ wine, vodka,\ngunpowder, and congealed blood.\n\nDaddy Er\xc3\xb3shka bowed down before the icons, smoothed his beard, and\napproaching Ol\xc3\xa9nin held out his thick brown hand. \xe2\x80\x9c_Koshkildy_,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nhe; \xe2\x80\x9cThat is Tartar for \xe2\x80\x98Good-day\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Peace be unto you,\xe2\x80\x99 it means in\ntheir tongue.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Koshkildy_, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ol\xc3\xa9nin, shaking hands.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t, you won\xe2\x80\x99t know the right order! Fool!\xe2\x80\x9d said Daddy\nEr\xc3\xb3shka, shaking his head reproachfully. \xe2\x80\x9cIf anyone says \xe2\x80\x98_Koshkildy_\xe2\x80\x99\nto you, you must say \xe2\x80\x98_Allah rasi bo sun_,\xe2\x80\x99 that is, \xe2\x80\x98God save you.\xe2\x80\x99\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way, my dear fellow, and not \xe2\x80\x98_Koshkildy_.\xe2\x80\x99 But I\xe2\x80\x99ll teach\nyou all about it. We had a fellow here, Elias M\xc3\xb3sevich, one of your\nRussians, he and I were _kunaks_. He was a trump, a drunkard, a thief,\na sportsman\xe2\x80\x94and what a sportsman! I taught him everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what will you teach me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin, who was becoming more and\nmore interested in the old man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take you hunting and teach you to fish. I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you Ch\xc3\xa9chens\nand find a girl for you, if you like\xe2\x80\x94even that! That\xe2\x80\x99s the sort I am!\nI\xe2\x80\x99m a wag!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and the old man laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll sit down. I\xe2\x80\x99m tired.\n_Karga?_\xe2\x80\x9d he added inquiringly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what does \xe2\x80\x98_Karga_\xe2\x80\x99 mean?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that means \xe2\x80\x98All right\xe2\x80\x99 in Georgian. But I say it just so. It is a\nway I have, it\xe2\x80\x99s my favourite word. _Karga_, _Karga_. I say it just so;\nin fun I mean. Well, lad, won\xe2\x80\x99t you order the _chikhir?_ You\xe2\x80\x99ve got an\norderly, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey, Iv\xc3\xa1n!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cAll your soldiers are Iv\xc3\xa1ns. Is\nyours Iv\xc3\xa1n?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue enough, his name is Iv\xc3\xa1n\xe2\x80\x94Vany\xc3\xbasha. Here Vany\xc3\xbasha! Please get some\n_chikhir_ from our landlady and bring it here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIv\xc3\xa1n or Vany\xc3\xbasha, that\xe2\x80\x99s all one. Why are all your soldiers Iv\xc3\xa1ns?\nIv\xc3\xa1n, old fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, \xe2\x80\x9cyou tell them to give you some\nfrom the barrel they have begun. They have the best _chikhir_ in the\nvillage. But don\xe2\x80\x99t give more than thirty kopeks for the quart, mind,\nbecause that witch would be only too glad.... Our people are anathema\npeople; stupid people,\xe2\x80\x9d Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka continued in a confidential tone\nafter Vany\xc3\xbasha had gone out. \xe2\x80\x9cThey do not look upon you as on men, you\nare worse than a Tartar in their eyes. \xe2\x80\x98Worldly Russians\xe2\x80\x99 they say. But\nas for me, though you are a soldier you are still a man, and have a\nsoul in you. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that right? Elias M\xc3\xb3sevich was a soldier, yet what a\ntreasure of a man he was! Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that so, my dear fellow? That\xe2\x80\x99s why our\npeople don\xe2\x80\x99t like me; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t care! I\xe2\x80\x99m a merry fellow, and I like\neverybody. I\xe2\x80\x99m Er\xc3\xb3shka; yes, my dear fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the old Cossack patted the young man affectionately on the\nshoulder.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XII\n\n\nVany\xc3\xbasha, who meanwhile had finished his housekeeping arrangements and\nhad even been shaved by the company\xe2\x80\x99s barber and had pulled his\ntrousers out of his high boots as a sign that the company was stationed\nin comfortable quarters, was in excellent spirits. He looked\nattentively but not benevolently at Er\xc3\xb3shka, as at a wild beast he had\nnever seen before, shook his head at the floor which the old man had\ndirtied and, having taken two bottles from under a bench, went to the\nlandlady.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood evening, kind people,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, having made up his mind to be\nvery gentle. \xe2\x80\x9cMy master has sent me to get some _chikhir_. Will you\ndraw some for me, good folk?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old woman gave no answer. The girl, who was arranging the kerchief\non her head before a little Tartar mirror, looked round at Vany\xc3\xbasha in\nsilence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll pay money for it, honoured people,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vany\xc3\xbasha, jingling the\ncoppers in his pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cBe kind to us and we, too will be kind to you,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe added.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the old woman abruptly. \xe2\x80\x9cA quart.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, my own, draw some for them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Granny Ul\xc3\xadtka to her daughter.\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it from the cask that\xe2\x80\x99s begun, my precious.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe girl took the keys and a decanter and went out of the hut with\nVany\xc3\xbasha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, who is that young woman?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin, pointing to Mary\xc3\xa1nka,\nwho was passing the window. The old man winked and nudged the young man\nwith his elbow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d said he and reached out of the window. \xe2\x80\x9cKhm,\xe2\x80\x9d he coughed,\nand bellowed, \xe2\x80\x9cMary\xc3\xa1nka dear. Hallo, Mary\xc3\xa1nka, my girlie, won\xe2\x80\x99t you\nlove me, darling? I\xe2\x80\x99m a wag,\xe2\x80\x9d he added in a whisper to Ol\xc3\xa9nin. The\ngirl, not turning her head and swinging her arms regularly and\nvigorously, passed the window with the peculiarly smart and bold gait\nof a Cossack woman and only turned her dark shaded eyes slowly towards\nthe old man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove me and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be happy,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Er\xc3\xb3shka, winking, and he looked\nquestioningly at the cadet.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a fine fellow, I\xe2\x80\x99m a wag!\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a regular queen, that\ngirl. Eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is lovely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin. \xe2\x80\x9cCall her here!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cFor that one a match is being arranged\nwith Luk\xc3\xa1shka, Luke, a fine Cossack, a brave, who killed an _abrek_ the\nother day. I\xe2\x80\x99ll find you a better one. I\xe2\x80\x99ll find you one that will be\nall dressed up in silk and silver. Once I\xe2\x80\x99ve said it I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\nget you a regular beauty!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, an old man\xe2\x80\x94and say such things,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ol\xc3\xa9nin. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s a\nsin!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA sin? Where\xe2\x80\x99s the sin?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man emphatically. \xe2\x80\x9cA sin to look\nat a nice girl? A sin to have some fun with her? Or is it a sin to love\nher? Is that so in your parts? ... No, my dear fellow, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a sin,\nit\xe2\x80\x99s salvation! God made you and God made the girl too. He made it all;\nso it is no sin to look at a nice girl. That\xe2\x80\x99s what she was made for;\nto be loved and to give joy. That\xe2\x80\x99s how I judge it, my good fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHaving crossed the yard and entered a cool dark storeroom filled with\nbarrels, Mary\xc3\xa1nka went up to one of them and repeating the usual prayer\nplunged a dipper into it. Vany\xc3\xbasha standing in the doorway smiled as he\nlooked at her. He thought it very funny that she had only a smock on,\nclose-fitting behind and tucked up in front, and still funnier that she\nwore a necklace of silver coins. He thought this quite un-Russian and\nthat they would all laugh in the serfs\xe2\x80\x99 quarters at home if they saw a\ngirl like that. \xe2\x80\x9c_La fille comme c\xe2\x80\x99est tres bien_, for a change,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nthought. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell that to my master.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you standing in the light for, you devil!\xe2\x80\x9d the girl suddenly\nshouted. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you pass me the decanter!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHaving filled the decanter with cool red wine, Mary\xc3\xa1nka handed it to\nVany\xc3\xbasha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive the money to Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, pushing away the hand in which he\nheld the money.\n\nVany\xc3\xbasha laughed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you so cross, little dear?\xe2\x80\x9d he said good-naturedly,\nirresolutely shuffling with his feet while the girl was covering the\nbarrel.\n\nShe began to laugh.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you! Are you kind?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe, my master and I, are very kind,\xe2\x80\x9d Vany\xc3\xbasha answered decidedly. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\nare so kind that wherever we have stayed our hosts were always very\ngrateful. It\xe2\x80\x99s because he\xe2\x80\x99s generous.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe girl stood listening.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is your master married?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. The master is young and unmarried, because noble gentlemen can\nnever marry young,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vany\xc3\xbasha didactically.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA likely thing! See what a fed-up buffalo he is\xe2\x80\x94and too young to\nmarry! Is he the chief of you all?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy master is a cadet; that means he\xe2\x80\x99s not yet an officer, but he\xe2\x80\x99s\nmore important than a general\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s an important man! Because not only\nour colonel, but the Tsar himself, knows him,\xe2\x80\x9d proudly explained\nVany\xc3\xbasha. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are not like those other beggars in the line regiment,\nand our papa himself was a Senator. He had more than a thousand serfs,\nall his own, and they send us a thousand rubles at a time. That\xe2\x80\x99s why\neveryone likes us. Another may be a captain but have no money. What\xe2\x80\x99s\nthe use of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo away. I\xe2\x80\x99ll lock up,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl, interrupting him.\n\nVany\xc3\xbasha brought Ol\xc3\xa9nin the wine and announced that \xe2\x80\x9c_La fille c\xe2\x80\x99est\ntres joulie_,\xe2\x80\x9d and, laughing stupidly, at once went out.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XIII\n\n\nMeanwhile the tattoo had sounded in the village square. The people had\nreturned from their work. The herd lowed as in clouds of golden dust it\ncrowded at the village gate. The girls and the women hurried through\nthe streets and yards, turning in their cattle. The sun had quite\nhidden itself behind the distant snowy peaks. One pale bluish shadow\nspread over land and sky. Above the darkened gardens stars just\ndiscernible were kindling, and the sounds were gradually hushed in the\nvillage. The cattle having been attended to and left for the night, the\nwomen came out and gathered at the corners of the streets and, cracking\nsunflower seeds with their teeth, settled down on the earthen\nembankments of the houses. Later on Mary\xc3\xa1nka, having finished milking\nthe buffalo and the other two cows, also joined one of these groups.\n\nThe group consisted of several women and girls and one old Cossack man.\n\nThey were talking about the _abrek_ who had been killed.\n\nThe Cossack was narrating and the women questioning him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect he\xe2\x80\x99ll get a handsome reward,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the women.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course. It\xe2\x80\x99s said that they\xe2\x80\x99ll send him a cross.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cM\xc3\xb3sev did try to wrong him. Took the gun away from him, but the\nauthorities at Kizly\xc3\xa1r heard of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA mean creature that M\xc3\xb3sev is!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say Luk\xc3\xa1shka has come home,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked one of the girls.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe and Naz\xc3\xa1rka are merry-making at Y\xc3\xa1mka\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d (Y\xc3\xa1mka was an unmarried,\ndisreputable Cossack woman who kept an illicit pot-house.) \xe2\x80\x9cI heard say\nthey had drunk half a pailful.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat luck that Snatcher has,\xe2\x80\x9d somebody remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cA real snatcher. But\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no denying he\xe2\x80\x99s a fine lad, smart enough for anything, a\nright-minded lad! His father was just such another. Daddy Kiry\xc3\xa1k was:\nhe takes after his father. When he was killed the whole village howled.\nLook, there they are,\xe2\x80\x9d added the speaker, pointing to the Cossacks who\nwere coming down the street towards them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Ergush\xc3\xb3v has managed to come along with them too! The drunkard!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka, Naz\xc3\xa1rka, and Ergush\xc3\xb3v, having emptied half a pail of vodka,\nwere coming towards the girls. The faces of all three, but especially\nthat of the old Cossack, were redder than usual. Ergush\xc3\xb3v was reeling\nand kept laughing and nudging Naz\xc3\xa1rka in the ribs.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you not singing?\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted to the girls. \xe2\x80\x9cSing to our\nmerry-making, I tell you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey were welcomed with the words, \xe2\x80\x9cHad a good day? Had a good day?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy sing? It\xe2\x80\x99s not a holiday,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the women. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re tight,\nso you go and sing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nErgush\xc3\xb3v roared with laughter and nudged Naz\xc3\xa1rka. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better sing.\nAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ll begin too. I\xe2\x80\x99m clever, I tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you asleep, fair ones?\xe2\x80\x9d said Naz\xc3\xa1rka. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve come from the cordon\nto drink your health. We\xe2\x80\x99ve already drunk Luk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s health.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka, when he reached the group, slowly raised his cap and stopped\nin front of the girls. His broad cheekbones and neck were red. He stood\nand spoke softly and sedately, but in his tranquillity and sedateness\nthere was more of animation and strength than in all Naz\xc3\xa1rka\xe2\x80\x99s\nloquacity and bustle. He reminded one of a playful colt that with a\nsnort and a flourish of its tail suddenly stops short and stands as\nthough nailed to the ground with all four feet. Luk\xc3\xa1shka stood quietly\nin front of the girls, his eyes laughed, and he spoke but little as he\nglanced now at his drunken companions and now at the girls. When\nMary\xc3\xa1nka joined the group he raised his cap with a firm deliberate\nmovement, moved out of her way and then stepped in front of her with\none foot a little forward and with his thumbs in his belt, fingering\nhis dagger. Mary\xc3\xa1nka answered his greeting with a leisurely bow of her\nhead, settled down on the earth-bank, and took some seeds out of the\nbosom of her smock. Luk\xc3\xa1shka, keeping his eyes fixed on Mary\xc3\xa1nka,\nslowly cracked seeds and spat out the shells. All were quiet when\nMary\xc3\xa1nka joined the group.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you come for long?\xe2\x80\x9d asked a woman, breaking the silence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTill tomorrow morning,\xe2\x80\x9d quietly replied Luk\xc3\xa1shka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, God grant you get something good,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Cossack; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad\nof it, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve just been saying.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I say so too,\xe2\x80\x9d put in the tipsy Ergush\xc3\xb3v, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a lot of\nvisitors have come,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, pointing to a soldier who was passing\nby. \xe2\x80\x9cThe soldiers\xe2\x80\x99 vodka is good\xe2\x80\x94I like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve sent three of the devils to us,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the women.\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrandad went to the village Elders, but they say nothing can be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ha! Have you met with trouble?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ergush\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect they have smoked you out with their tobacco?\xe2\x80\x9d asked another\nwoman. \xe2\x80\x9cSmoke as much as you like in the yard, I say, but we won\xe2\x80\x99t\nallow it inside the hut. Not if the Elder himself comes, I won\xe2\x80\x99t allow\nit. Besides, they may rob you. He\xe2\x80\x99s not quartered any of them on\nhimself, no fear, that devil\xe2\x80\x99s son of an Elder.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t like it?\xe2\x80\x9d Ergush\xc3\xb3v began again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ve also heard say that the girls will have to make the soldiers\xe2\x80\x99\nbeds and offer them _chikhir_ and honey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Naz\xc3\xa1rka, putting one\nfoot forward and tilting his cap like Luk\xc3\xa1shka.\n\nErgush\xc3\xb3v burst into a roar of laughter, and seizing the girl nearest to\nhim, he embraced her. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you true.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, you black pitch!\xe2\x80\x9d squealed the girl, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell your old\nwoman.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell her,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted he. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s quite right what Naz\xc3\xa1rka says; a\ncircular has been sent round. He can read, you know. Quite true!\xe2\x80\x9d And\nhe began embracing the next girl.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you up to, you beast?\xe2\x80\x9d squealed the rosy, round-faced\n\xc3\x9astenka, laughing and lifting her arm to hit him.\n\nThe Cossack stepped aside and nearly fell.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, they say girls have no strength, and you nearly killed me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet away, you black pitch, what devil has brought you from the\ncordon?\xe2\x80\x9d said \xc3\x9astenka, and turning away from him she again burst out\nlaughing. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were asleep and missed the _abrek_, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you? Suppose\nhe had done for you it would have been all the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d have howled, I expect,\xe2\x80\x9d said Naz\xc3\xa1rka, laughing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowled! A likely thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust look, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care. She\xe2\x80\x99d howl, Naz\xc3\xa1rka, eh? Would she?\xe2\x80\x9d said\nErgush\xc3\xb3v.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka all this time had stood silently looking at Mary\xc3\xa1nka. His gaze\nevidently confused the girl.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mary\xc3\xa1nka! I hear they\xe2\x80\x99ve quartered one of the chiefs on you?\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid, drawing nearer.\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka, as was her wont, waited before she replied, and slowly\nraising her eyes looked at the Cossack. Luk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were laughing\nas if something special, apart from what was said, was taking place\nbetween himself and the girl.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right for them as they have two huts,\xe2\x80\x9d replied an old\nwoman on Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s behalf, \xe2\x80\x9cbut at F\xc3\xb3mushkin\xe2\x80\x99s now they also have one\nof the chiefs quartered on them and they say one whole corner is packed\nfull with his things, and the family have no room left. Was such a\nthing ever heard of as that they should turn a whole horde loose in the\nvillage?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what the plague are they going to do here?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard say they\xe2\x80\x99ll build a bridge across the T\xc3\xa9rek,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of\nthe girls.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ve been told that they will dig a pit to put the girls in\nbecause they don\xe2\x80\x99t love the lads,\xe2\x80\x9d said Naz\xc3\xa1rka, approaching \xc3\x9astenka;\nand he again made a whimsical gesture which set everybody laughing, and\nErgush\xc3\xb3v, passing by Mary\xc3\xa1nka, who was next in turn, began to embrace\nan old woman.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you hug Mary\xc3\xa1nka? You should do it to each in turn,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my old one is sweeter,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the Cossack, kissing the\nstruggling old woman.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll throttle me,\xe2\x80\x9d she screamed, laughing.\n\nThe tramp of regular footsteps at the other end of the street\ninterrupted their laughter. Three soldiers in their cloaks, with their\nmuskets on their shoulders, were marching in step to relieve guard by\nthe ammunition wagon.\n\nThe corporal, an old cavalry man, looked angrily at the Cossacks and\nled his men straight along the road where Luk\xc3\xa1shka and Naz\xc3\xa1rka were\nstanding, so that they should have to get out of the way. Naz\xc3\xa1rka\nmoved, but Luk\xc3\xa1shka only screwed up his eyes and turned his broad back\nwithout moving from his place.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople are standing here, so you go round,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, half turning\nhis head and tossing it contemptuously in the direction of the\nsoldiers.\n\nThe soldiers passed by in silence, keeping step regularly along the\ndusty road.\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka began laughing and all the other girls chimed in.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat swells!\xe2\x80\x9d said Naz\xc3\xa1rka, \xe2\x80\x9cJust like long-skirted choristers,\xe2\x80\x9d and\nhe walked a few steps down the road imitating the soldiers.\n\nAgain everyone broke into peals of laughter.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka came slowly up to Mary\xc3\xa1nka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where have you put up the chief?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka thought for a moment.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve let him have the new hut,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is he old or young,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Luk\xc3\xa1shka, sitting down beside her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked?\xe2\x80\x9d answered the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cI went to get him some\n_chikhir_ and saw him sitting at the window with Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka.\nRed-headed he seemed. They\xe2\x80\x99ve brought a whole cartload of things.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd she dropped her eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how glad I am that I got leave from the cordon!\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka,\nmoving closer to the girl and looking straight in her eyes all the\ntime.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have you come for long?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mary\xc3\xa1nka, smiling slightly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTill the morning. Give me some sunflower seeds,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, holding out\nhis hand.\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka now smiled outright and unfastened the neckband of her smock.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t take them all,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally I felt so dull all the time without you, I swear I did,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid in a calm, restrained whisper, helping himself to some seeds out\nof the bosom of the girl\xe2\x80\x99s smock, and stooping still closer over her he\ncontinued with laughing eyes to talk to her in low tones.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t come, I tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary\xc3\xa1nka suddenly said aloud, leaning away\nfrom him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo really ... what I wanted to say to you, ...\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Luk\xc3\xa1shka.\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the Heavens! Do come!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka shook her head, but did so with a smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNursey Mary\xc3\xa1nka! Hallo Nursey! Mammy is calling! Supper time!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted\nMary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s little brother, running towards the group.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m coming,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cGo, my dear, go alone\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll come in a\nminute.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka rose and raised his cap.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect I had better go home too, that will be best,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, trying\nto appear unconcerned but hardly able to repress a smile, and he\ndisappeared behind the corner of the house.\n\nMeanwhile night had entirely enveloped the village. Bright stars were\nscattered over the dark sky. The streets became dark and empty. Naz\xc3\xa1rka\nremained with the women on the earth-bank and their laughter was still\nheard, but Luk\xc3\xa1shka, having slowly moved away from the girls, crouched\ndown like a cat and then suddenly started running lightly, holding his\ndagger to steady it: not homeward, however, but towards the cornet\xe2\x80\x99s\nhouse. Having passed two streets he turned into a lane and lifting the\nskirt of his coat sat down on the ground in the shadow of a fence. \xe2\x80\x9cA\nregular cornet\xe2\x80\x99s daughter!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought about Mary\xc3\xa1nka. \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t even have\na lark\xe2\x80\x94the devil! But just wait a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe approaching footsteps of a woman attracted his attention. He began\nlistening, and laughed all by himself. Mary\xc3\xa1nka with bowed head,\nstriking the pales of the fences with a switch, was walking with rapid\nregular strides straight towards him. Luk\xc3\xa1shka rose. Mary\xc3\xa1nka started\nand stopped.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an accursed devil! You frightened me! So you have not gone home?\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe said, and laughed aloud.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka put one arm round her and with the other hand raised her face.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I wanted to tell you, by Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d his voice trembled and broke.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you talking of, at night time!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mary\xc3\xa1nka. \xe2\x80\x9cMother is\nwaiting for me, and you\xe2\x80\x99d better go to your sweetheart.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd freeing herself from his arms she ran away a few steps. When she\nhad reached the wattle fence of her home she stopped and turned to the\nCossack who was running beside her and still trying to persuade her to\nstay a while with him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what do you want to say, midnight-gadabout?\xe2\x80\x9d and she again began\nlaughing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t laugh at me, Mary\xc3\xa1nka! By the Heaven! Well, what if I have a\nsweetheart? May the devil take her! Only say the word and now I\xe2\x80\x99ll love\nyou\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything you wish. Here they are!\xe2\x80\x9d and he jingled the money\nin his pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cNow we can live splendidly. Others have pleasures, and\nI? I get no pleasure from you, Mary\xc3\xa1nka dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe girl did not answer. She stood before him breaking her switch into\nlittle bits with a rapid movement of her fingers.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka suddenly clenched his teeth and fists.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why keep waiting and waiting? Don\xe2\x80\x99t I love you, darling? You can\ndo what you like with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said he suddenly, frowning angrily and\nseizing both her hands.\n\nThe calm expression of Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s face and voice did not change.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t bluster, Luk\xc3\xa1shka, but listen to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, not pulling\naway her hands but holding the Cossack at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s true I am\na girl, but you listen to me! It does not depend on me, but if you love\nme I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you this. Let go my hands, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you without.\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll\nmarry you, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll never get any nonsense from me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary\xc3\xa1nka\nwithout turning her face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, you\xe2\x80\x99ll marry me? Marriage does not depend on us. Love me\nyourself, Mary\xc3\xa1nka dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, from sullen and furious\nbecoming again gentle, submissive, and tender, and smiling as he looked\nclosely into her eyes.\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka clung to him and kissed him firmly on the lips.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrother dear!\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, pressing him convulsively to her. Then,\nsuddenly tearing herself away, she ran into the gate of her house\nwithout looking round.\n\nIn spite of the Cossack\xe2\x80\x99s entreaties to wait another minute to hear\nwhat he had to say, Mary\xc3\xa1nka did not stop.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll be seen! I do believe that devil, our lodger,\nis walking about the yard.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCornet\xe2\x80\x99s daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Luk\xc3\xa1shka. \xe2\x80\x9cShe will marry me. Marriage is\nall very well, but you just love me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe found Naz\xc3\xa1rka at Y\xc3\xa1mka\xe2\x80\x99s house, and after having a spree with him\nwent to Dun\xc3\xa1yka\xe2\x80\x99s house, where, in spite of her not being faithful to\nhim, he spent the night.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XIV\n\n\nIt was quite true that Ol\xc3\xa9nin had been walking about the yard when\nMary\xc3\xa1nka entered the gate, and had heard her say, \xe2\x80\x9cThat devil, our\nlodger, is walking about.\xe2\x80\x9d He had spent that evening with Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka\nin the porch of his new lodging. He had had a table, a samovar, wine,\nand a candle brought out, and over a cup of tea and a cigar he listened\nto the tales the old man told seated on the threshold at his feet.\nThough the air was still, the candle dripped and flickered: now\nlighting up the post of the porch, now the table and crockery, now the\ncropped white head of the old man. Moths circled round the flame and,\nshedding the dust of their wings, fluttered on the table and in the\nglasses, flew into the candle flame, and disappeared in the black space\nbeyond. Ol\xc3\xa9nin and Er\xc3\xb3shka had emptied five bottles of _chikhir_.\nEr\xc3\xb3shka filled the glasses every time, offering one to Ol\xc3\xa9nin, drinking\nhis health, and talking untiringly. He told of Cossack life in the old\ndays: of his father, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Broad\xe2\x80\x9d, who alone had carried on his back a\nboar\xe2\x80\x99s carcass weighing three hundredweight, and drank two pails of\n_chikhir_ at one sitting. He told of his own days and his chum G\xc3\xadrchik,\nwith whom during the plague he used to smuggle felt cloaks across the\nT\xc3\xa9rek. He told how one morning he had killed two deer, and about his\n\xe2\x80\x9clittle soul\xe2\x80\x9d who used to run to him at the cordon at night. He told\nall this so eloquently and picturesquely that Ol\xc3\xa9nin did not notice how\ntime passed. \xe2\x80\x9cAh yes, my dear fellow, you did not know me in my golden\ndays; then I\xe2\x80\x99d have shown you things. Today it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Er\xc3\xb3shka licks the\njug\xe2\x80\x99, but then Er\xc3\xb3shka was famous in the whole regiment. Whose was the\nfinest horse? Who had a Gurda sword? To whom should one go to get a\ndrink? With whom go on the spree? Who should be sent to the mountains\nto kill Ahmet Khan? Why, always Er\xc3\xb3shka! Whom did the girls love?\nAlways Er\xc3\xb3shka had to answer for it. Because I was a real brave: a\ndrinker, a thief (I used to seize herds of horses in the mountains), a\nsinger; I was a master of every art! There are no Cossacks like that\nnowadays. It\xe2\x80\x99s disgusting to look at them. When they\xe2\x80\x99re that high\n(Er\xc3\xb3shka held his hand three feet from the ground) they put on idiotic\nboots and keep looking at them\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all the pleasure they know. Or\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ll drink themselves foolish, not like men but all wrong. And who\nwas I? I was Er\xc3\xb3shka, the thief; they knew me not only in this village\nbut up in the mountains. Tartar princes, my _kunaks_, used to come to\nsee me! I used to be everybody\xe2\x80\x99s _kunak_. If he was a Tartar\xe2\x80\x94with a\nTartar; an Armenian\xe2\x80\x94with an Armenian; a soldier\xe2\x80\x94with a soldier; an\nofficer\xe2\x80\x94with an officer! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t care as long as he was a drinker. He\nsays you should cleanse yourself from intercourse with the world, not\ndrink with soldiers, not eat with a Tartar.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho says all that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, our teacher! But listen to a Mullah or a Tartar Cadi. He says,\n\xe2\x80\x98You unbelieving Giaours, why do you eat pig?\xe2\x80\x99 That shows that everyone\nhas his own law. But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s all one. God has made everything for\nthe joy of man. There is no sin in any of it. Take example from an\nanimal. It lives in the Tartar\xe2\x80\x99s reeds or in ours. Wherever it happens\nto go, there is its home! Whatever God gives it, that it eats! But our\npeople say we have to lick red-hot plates in hell for that. And I think\nit\xe2\x80\x99s all a fraud,\xe2\x80\x9d he added after a pause.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is a fraud?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what the preachers say. We had an army captain in Chervl\xc3\xabna who\nwas my _kunak:_ a fine fellow just like me. He was killed in Ch\xc3\xa9chnya.\nWell, he used to say that the preachers invent all that out of their\nown heads. \xe2\x80\x98When you die the grass will grow on your grave and that\xe2\x80\x99s\nall!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d The old man laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was a desperate fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how old are you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord only knows! I must be about seventy. When a Tsaritsa reigned\nin Russia I was no longer very small. So you can reckon it out. I must\nbe seventy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes you must, but you are still a fine fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, thank Heaven I am healthy, quite healthy, except that a woman, a\nwitch, has harmed me....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, just harmed me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so when you die the grass will grow?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\nEr\xc3\xb3shka evidently did not wish to express his thought clearly. He was\nsilent for a while.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did you think? Drink!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted suddenly, smiling and\nhanding Ol\xc3\xa9nin some wine.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XV\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what was I saying?\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, trying to remember. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of man I am. I am a hunter. There is no hunter to equal\nme in the whole army. I will find and show you any animal and any bird,\nand what and where. I know it all! I have dogs, and two guns, and nets,\nand a screen and a hawk. I have everything, thank the Lord! If you are\nnot bragging but are a real sportsman, I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you everything. Do you\nknow what a man I am? When I have found a track\xe2\x80\x94I know the animal. I\nknow where he will lie down and where he\xe2\x80\x99ll drink or wallow. I make\nmyself a perch and sit there all night watching. What\xe2\x80\x99s the good of\nstaying at home? One only gets into mischief, gets drunk. And here\nwomen come and chatter, and boys shout at me\xe2\x80\x94enough to drive one mad\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a different matter when you go out at nightfall, choose yourself\na place, press down the reeds and sit there and stay waiting, like a\njolly fellow. One knows everything that goes on in the woods. One looks\nup at the sky: the stars move, you look at them and find out from them\nhow the time goes. One looks round\xe2\x80\x94the wood is rustling; one goes on\nwaiting, now there comes a crackling\xe2\x80\x94a boar comes to rub himself; one\nlistens to hear the young eaglets screech and then the cocks give voice\nin the village, or the geese. When you hear the geese you know it is\nnot yet midnight. And I know all about it! Or when a gun is fired\nsomewhere far away, thoughts come to me. One thinks, who is that\nfiring? Is it another Cossack like myself who has been watching for\nsome animal? And has he killed it? Or only wounded it so that now the\npoor thing goes through the reeds smearing them with its blood all for\nnothing? I don\xe2\x80\x99t like that! Oh, how I dislike it! Why injure a beast?\nYou fool, you fool! Or one thinks, \xe2\x80\x98Maybe an _abrek_ has killed some\nsilly little Cossack.\xe2\x80\x99 All this passes through one\xe2\x80\x99s mind. And once as\nI sat watching by the river I saw a cradle floating down. It was sound\nexcept for one corner which was broken off. Thoughts did come that\ntime! I thought some of your soldiers, the devils, must have got into a\nTartar village and seized the Ch\xc3\xa9chen women, and one of the devils has\nkilled the little one: taken it by its legs, and hit its head against a\nwall. Don\xe2\x80\x99t they do such things? Sh! Men have no souls! And thoughts\ncame to me that filled me with pity. I thought: they\xe2\x80\x99ve thrown away the\ncradle and driven the wife out, and her brave has taken his gun and\ncome across to our side to rob us. One watches and thinks. And when one\nhears a litter breaking through the thicket, something begins to knock\ninside one. Dear one, come this way! \xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99ll scent me,\xe2\x80\x99 one thinks;\nand one sits and does not stir while one\xe2\x80\x99s heart goes dun! dun! dun!\nand simply lifts you. Once this spring a fine litter came near me, I\nsaw something black. \xe2\x80\x98In the name of the Father and of the Son,\xe2\x80\x99 and I\nwas just about to fire when she grunts to her pigs: \xe2\x80\x98Danger, children,\xe2\x80\x99\nshe says, \xe2\x80\x98there\xe2\x80\x99s a man here,\xe2\x80\x99 and off they all ran, breaking through\nthe bushes. And she had been so close I could almost have bitten her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could a sow tell her brood that a man was there?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think? You think the beast\xe2\x80\x99s a fool? No, he is wiser than\na man though you do call him a pig! He knows everything. Take this for\ninstance. A man will pass along your track and not notice it; but a pig\nas soon as it gets onto your track turns and runs at once: that shows\nthere is wisdom in him, since he scents your smell and you don\xe2\x80\x99t. And\nthere is this to be said too: you wish to kill it and it wishes to go\nabout the woods alive. You have one law and it has another. It is a\npig, but it is no worse than you\xe2\x80\x94it too is God\xe2\x80\x99s creature. Ah, dear!\nMan is foolish, foolish, foolish!\xe2\x80\x9d The old man repeated this several\ntimes and then, letting his head drop, he sat thinking.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin also became thoughtful, and descending from the porch with his\nhands behind his back began pacing up and down the yard.\n\nEr\xc3\xb3shka, rousing himself, raised his head and began gazing intently at\nthe moths circling round the flickering flame of the candle and burning\nthemselves in it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFool, fool!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you flying to? Fool, fool!\xe2\x80\x9d He rose\nand with his thick fingers began to drive away the moths.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll burn, little fool! Fly this way, there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of room.\xe2\x80\x9d He\nspoke tenderly, trying to catch them delicately by their wings with his\nthick fingers and then letting them fly again. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are killing\nyourself and I am sorry for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe sat a long time chattering and sipping out of the bottle. Ol\xc3\xa9nin\npaced up and down the yard. Suddenly he was struck by the sound of\nwhispering outside the gate. Involuntarily holding his breath, he heard\na woman\xe2\x80\x99s laughter, a man\xe2\x80\x99s voice, and the sound of a kiss.\nIntentionally rustling the grass under his feet he crossed to the\nopposite side of the yard, but after a while the wattle fence creaked.\nA Cossack in a dark Circassian coat and a white sheepskin cap passed\nalong the other side of the fence (it was Luke), and a tall woman with\na white kerchief on her head went past Ol\xc3\xa9nin. \xe2\x80\x9cYou and I have nothing\nto do with one another\xe2\x80\x9d was what Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s firm step gave him to\nunderstand. He followed her with his eyes to the porch of the hut, and\nhe even saw her through the window take off her kerchief and sit down.\nAnd suddenly a feeling of lonely depression and some vague longings and\nhopes, and envy of someone or other, overcame the young man\xe2\x80\x99s soul.\n\nThe last lights had been put out in the huts. The last sounds had died\naway in the village. The wattle fences and the cattle gleaming white in\nthe yards, the roofs of the houses and the stately poplars, all seemed\nto be sleeping the labourers\xe2\x80\x99 healthy peaceful sleep. Only the\nincessant ringing voices of frogs from the damp distance reached the\nyoung man. In the east the stars were growing fewer and fewer and\nseemed to be melting in the increasing light, but overhead they were\ndenser and deeper than before. The old man was dozing with his head on\nhis hand. A cock crowed in the yard opposite, but Ol\xc3\xa9nin still paced up\nand down thinking of something. The sound of a song sung by several\nvoices reached him and he stepped up to the fence and listened. The\nvoices of several young Cossacks carolled a merry song, and one voice\nwas distinguishable among them all by its firm strength.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know who is singing there?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, rousing himself.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the Brave, Luk\xc3\xa1shka. He has killed a Ch\xc3\xa9chen and now he\nrejoices. And what is there to rejoice at? ... The fool, the fool!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have you ever killed people?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou devil!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you asking? One must not\ntalk so. It is a serious thing to destroy a human being ... Ah, a very\nserious thing! Good-bye, my dear fellow. I\xe2\x80\x99ve eaten my fill and am\ndrunk,\xe2\x80\x9d he said rising. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I come tomorrow to go shooting?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, come!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind, get up early; if you oversleep you will be fined!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever fear, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be up before you,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\nThe old man left. The song ceased, but one could hear footsteps and\nmerry talk. A little later the singing broke out again but farther\naway, and Er\xc3\xb3shka\xe2\x80\x99s loud voice chimed in with the other. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat people,\nwhat a life!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Ol\xc3\xa9nin with a sigh as he returned alone to his\nhut.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XVI\n\n\nDaddy Er\xc3\xb3shka was a superannuated and solitary Cossack: twenty years\nago his wife had gone over to the Orthodox Church and run away from him\nand married a Russian sergeant-major, and he had no children. He was\nnot bragging when he spoke of himself as having been the boldest\ndare-devil in the village when he was young. Everybody in the regiment\nknew of his old-time prowess. The death of more than one Russian, as\nwell as Ch\xc3\xa9chen, lay on his conscience. He used to go plundering in the\nmountains, and robbed the Russians too; and he had twice been in\nprison. The greater part of his life was spent in the forests, hunting.\nThere he lived for days on a crust of bread and drank nothing but\nwater. But on the other hand, when he was in the village he made merry\nfrom morning to night. After leaving Ol\xc3\xa9nin he slept for a couple of\nhours and awoke before it was light. He lay on his bed thinking of the\nman he had become acquainted with the evening before. Ol\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s\n\xe2\x80\x9csimplicity\xe2\x80\x9d (simplicity in the sense of not grudging him a drink)\npleased him very much, and so did Ol\xc3\xa9nin himself. He wondered why the\nRussians were all \xe2\x80\x9csimple\xe2\x80\x9d and so rich, and why they were educated, and\nyet knew nothing. He pondered on these questions and also considered\nwhat he might get out of Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\nDaddy Er\xc3\xb3shka\xe2\x80\x99s hut was of a good size and not old, but the absence of\na woman was very noticeable in it. Contrary to the usual cleanliness of\nthe Cossacks, the whole of this hut was filthy and exceedingly untidy.\nA blood-stained coat had been thrown on the table, half a dough-cake\nlay beside a plucked and mangled crow with which to feed the hawk.\nSandals of raw hide, a gun, a dagger, a little bag, wet clothes, and\nsundry rags lay scattered on the benches. In a corner stood a tub with\nstinking water, in which another pair of sandals were being steeped,\nand near by was a gun and a hunting-screen. On the floor a net had been\nthrown down and several dead pheasants lay there, while a hen tied by\nits leg was walking about near the table pecking among the dirt. In the\nunheated oven stood a broken pot with some kind of milky liquid. On the\ntop of the oven a falcon was screeching and trying to break the cord by\nwhich it was tied, and a moulting hawk sat quietly on the edge of the\noven, looking askance at the hen and occasionally bowing its head to\nright and left. Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka himself, in his shirt, lay on his back on\na short bed rigged up between the wall and the oven, with his strong\nlegs raised and his feet on the oven. He was picking with his thick\nfingers at the scratches left on his hands by the hawk, which he was\naccustomed to carry without wearing gloves. The whole room, especially\nnear the old man, was filled with that strong but not unpleasant\nmixture of smells that he always carried about with him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Uyde-ma_, Daddy?\xe2\x80\x9d (Is Daddy in?) came through the window in a sharp\nvoice, which he at once recognized as Luk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Uyde, Uyde, Uyde_. I am in!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cCome in, neighbour\nMark, Luke Mark. Come to see Daddy? On your way to the cordon?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt the sound of his master\xe2\x80\x99s shout the hawk flapped his wings and\npulled at his cord.\n\nThe old man was fond of Luk\xc3\xa1shka, who was the only man he excepted from\nhis general contempt for the younger generation of Cossacks. Besides\nthat, Luk\xc3\xa1shka and his mother, as near neighbours, often gave the old\nman wine, clotted cream, and other home produce which Er\xc3\xb3shka did not\npossess. Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka, who all his life had allowed himself to get\ncarried away, always explained his infatuations from a practical point\nof view. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, why not?\xe2\x80\x9d he used to say to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll give them\nsome fresh meat, or a bird, and they won\xe2\x80\x99t forget Daddy: they\xe2\x80\x99ll\nsometimes bring a cake or a piece of pie.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, Mark! I am glad to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the old man\ncheerfully, and quickly putting down his bare feet he jumped off his\nbed and walked a step or two along the creaking floor, looked down at\nhis out-turned toes, and suddenly, amused by the appearance of his\nfeet, smiled, stamped with his bare heel on the ground, stamped again,\nand then performed a funny dance-step. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s clever, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked,\nhis small eyes glistening. Luk\xc3\xa1shka smiled faintly. \xe2\x80\x9cGoing back to the\ncordon?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the old man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have brought the _chikhir_ I promised you when we were at the\ncordon.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay Christ save you!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, and he took up the extremely\nwide trousers that were lying on the floor, and his _beshmet_, put them\non, fastened a strap round his waist, poured some water from an\nearthenware pot over his hands, wiped them on the old trousers,\nsmoothed his beard with a bit of comb, and stopped in front of\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka. \xe2\x80\x9cReady,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka fetched a cup, wiped it and filled it with wine, and then\nhanded it to the old man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour health! To the Father and the Son!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, accepting\nthe wine with solemnity. \xe2\x80\x9cMay you have what you desire, may you always\nbe a hero, and obtain a cross.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka also drank a little after repeating a prayer, and then put the\nwine on the table. The old man rose and brought out some dried fish\nwhich he laid on the threshold, where he beat it with a stick to make\nit tender; then, having put it with his horny hands on a blue plate\n(his only one), he placed it on the table.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have all I want. I have victuals, thank God!\xe2\x80\x9d he said proudly.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and what of M\xc3\xb3sev?\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka, evidently wishing to know the old man\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, told him how\nthe officer had taken the gun from him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind the gun,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t give the gun you\nwill get no reward.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they say, Daddy, it\xe2\x80\x99s little reward a fellow gets when he is not\nyet a mounted Cossack; and the gun is a fine one, a Crimean, worth\neighty rubles.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, let it go! I had a dispute like that with an officer, he wanted my\nhorse. \xe2\x80\x98Give it me and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be made a cornet,\xe2\x80\x99 says he. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\nand I got nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Daddy, but you see I have to buy a horse; and they say you can\xe2\x80\x99t\nget one the other side of the river under fifty rubles, and mother has\nnot yet sold our wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t bother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man; \xe2\x80\x9cwhen Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka was your\nage he already stole herds of horses from the Nog\xc3\xa1y folk and drove them\nacross the T\xc3\xa9rek. Sometimes we\xe2\x80\x99d give a fine horse for a quart of vodka\nor a cloak.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so cheap?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Luk\xc3\xa1shka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a fool, a fool, Mark,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man contemptuously. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s what one steals for, so as not to be stingy! As for you, I\nsuppose you haven\xe2\x80\x99t so much as seen how one drives off a herd of\nhorses? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you speak?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s one to say, Daddy?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Luk\xc3\xa1shka. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems we are not the\nsame sort of men as you were.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a fool, Mark, a fool! \xe2\x80\x98Not the same sort of men!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the\nold man, mimicking the Cossack lad. \xe2\x80\x9cI was not that sort of Cossack at\nyour age.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Luk\xc3\xa1shka.\n\nThe old man shook his head contemptuously.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDaddy Er\xc3\xb3shka was _simple;_ he did not grudge anything! That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\nwas _kunak_ with all Ch\xc3\xa9chnya. A _kunak_ would come to visit me and I\xe2\x80\x99d\nmake him drunk with vodka and make him happy and put him to sleep with\nme, and when I went to see him I\xe2\x80\x99d take him a present\xe2\x80\x94a dagger! That\xe2\x80\x99s\nthe way it is done, and not as you do nowadays: the only amusement lads\nhave now is to crack seeds and spit out the shells!\xe2\x80\x9d the old man\nfinished contemptuously, imitating the present-day Cossacks cracking\nseeds and spitting out the shells.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s so!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you wish to be a fellow of the right sort, be a brave and not a\npeasant! Because even a peasant can buy a horse\xe2\x80\x94pay the money and take\nthe horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey were silent for a while.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, of course it\xe2\x80\x99s dull both in the village and the cordon, Daddy:\nbut there\xe2\x80\x99s nowhere one can go for a bit of sport. All our fellows are\nso timid. Take Naz\xc3\xa1rka. The other day when we went to the Tartar\nvillage, Gir\xc3\xa9y Khan asked us to come to Nog\xc3\xa1y to take some horses, but\nno one went, and how was I to go alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what of Daddy? Do you think I am quite dried up? ... No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not\ndried up. Let me have a horse and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be off to Nog\xc3\xa1y at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good of talking nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d said Luke. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better tell me\nwhat to do about Gir\xc3\xa9y Khan. He says, \xe2\x80\x98Only bring horses to the T\xc3\xa9rek,\nand then even if you bring a whole stud I\xe2\x80\x99ll find a place for them.\xe2\x80\x99\nYou see he\xe2\x80\x99s also a shaven-headed Tartar\xe2\x80\x94how\xe2\x80\x99s one to believe him?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may trust Gir\xc3\xa9y Khan, all his kin were good people. His father too\nwas a faithful _kunak_. But listen to Daddy and I won\xe2\x80\x99t teach you\nwrong: make him take an oath, then it will be all right. And if you go\nwith him, have your pistol ready all the same, especially when it comes\nto dividing up the horses. I was nearly killed that way once by a\nCh\xc3\xa9chen. I wanted ten rubles from him for a horse. Trusting is all\nright, but don\xe2\x80\x99t go to sleep without a gun.\xe2\x80\x9d Luk\xc3\xa1shka listened\nattentively to the old man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Daddy, have you any stone-break grass?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked after a pause.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t any, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll teach you how to get it. You\xe2\x80\x99re a good lad\nand won\xe2\x80\x99t forget the old man.... Shall I tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, Daddy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know a tortoise? She\xe2\x80\x99s a devil, the tortoise is!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I know!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFind her nest and fence it round so that she can\xe2\x80\x99t get in. Well,\nshe\xe2\x80\x99ll come, go round it, and then will go off to find the stone-break\ngrass and will bring some along and destroy the fence. Anyhow next\nmorning come in good time, and where the fence is broken there you\xe2\x80\x99ll\nfind the stone-break grass lying. Take it wherever you like. No lock\nand no bar will be able to stop you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you tried it yourself, Daddy?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for trying, I have not tried it, but I was told of it by good\npeople. I used only one charm: that was to repeat the Pilgrim rhyme\nwhen mounting my horse; and no one ever killed me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the Pilgrim rhyme, Daddy?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know it? Oh, what people! You\xe2\x80\x99re right to ask Daddy.\nWell, listen, and repeat after me:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHail! Ye, living in Sion,\nThis is your King,\nOur steeds we shall sit on,\nSophonius is weeping.\nZacharias is speaking,\nFather Pilgrim,\nMankind ever loving.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKind ever loving,\xe2\x80\x9d the old man repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know it now? Try it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka laughed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Daddy, was it that that hindered their killing you? Maybe it\njust happened so!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve grown too clever! You learn it all, and say it. It will do you\nno harm. Well, suppose you have sung \xe2\x80\x98Pilgrim\xe2\x80\x99, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d and\nthe old man himself began laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cBut just one thing, Luke, don\xe2\x80\x99t\nyou go to Nog\xc3\xa1y!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTimes have changed. You are not the same men. You\xe2\x80\x99ve become rubbishy\nCossacks! And see how many Russians have come down on us! You\xe2\x80\x99d get to\nprison. Really, give it up! Just as if you could! Now G\xc3\xadrchik and I, we\nused...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the old man was about to begin one of his endless tales, but\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka glanced at the window and interrupted him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is quite light. Daddy. It\xe2\x80\x99s time to be off. Look us up some day.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay Christ save you! I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the officer; I promised to take him\nout shooting. He seems a good fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XVII\n\n\nFrom Er\xc3\xb3shka\xe2\x80\x99s hut Luk\xc3\xa1shka went home. As he returned, the dewy mists\nwere rising from the ground and enveloped the village. In various\nplaces the cattle, though out of sight, could be heard beginning to\nstir. The cocks called to one another with increasing frequency and\ninsistence. The air was becoming more transparent, and the villagers\nwere getting up. Not till he was close to it could Luk\xc3\xa1shka discern the\nfence of his yard, all wet with dew, the porch of the hut, and the open\nshed. From the misty yard he heard the sound of an axe chopping wood.\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka entered the hut. His mother was up, and stood at the oven\nthrowing wood into it. His little sister was still lying in bed asleep.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Luk\xc3\xa1shka, had enough holiday-making?\xe2\x80\x9d asked his mother softly.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you spend the night?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was in the village,\xe2\x80\x9d replied her son reluctantly, reaching for his\nmusket, which he drew from its cover and examined carefully.\n\nHis mother swayed her head.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka poured a little gunpowder onto the pan, took out a little bag\nfrom which he drew some empty cartridge cases which he began filling,\ncarefully plugging each one with a ball wrapped in a rag. Then, having\ntested the loaded cartridges with his teeth and examined them, he put\ndown the bag.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Mother, I told you the bags wanted mending; have they been\ndone?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, our dumb girl was mending something last night. Why, is it\ntime for you to be going back to the cordon? I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen anything of\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, as soon as I have got ready I shall have to go,\xe2\x80\x9d answered\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka, tying up the gunpowder. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd where is our dumb one? Outside?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cChopping wood, I expect. She kept fretting for you. \xe2\x80\x98I shall not see\nhim at all!\xe2\x80\x99 she said. She puts her hand to her face like this, and\nclicks her tongue and presses her hands to her heart as much as to\nsay\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98sorry.\xe2\x80\x99 Shall I call her in? She understood all about the\n_abrek_.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I had some tallow there; bring it: I\nmust grease my sword.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old woman went out, and a few minutes later Luk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s dumb sister\ncame up the creaking steps and entered the hut. She was six years older\nthan her brother and would have been extremely like him had it not been\nfor the dull and coarsely changeable expression (common to all deaf and\ndumb people) of her face. She wore a coarse smock all patched; her feet\nwere bare and muddy, and on her head she had an old blue kerchief. Her\nneck, arms, and face were sinewy like a peasant\xe2\x80\x99s. Her clothing and her\nwhole appearance indicated that she always did the hard work of a man.\nShe brought in a heap of logs which she threw down by the oven. Then\nshe went up to her brother, and with a joyful smile which made her\nwhole face pucker up, touched him on the shoulder and began making\nrapid signs to him with her hands, her face, and whole body.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right, that\xe2\x80\x99s right, St\xc3\xabpka is a trump!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the brother,\nnodding. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s fetched everything and mended everything, she\xe2\x80\x99s a\ntrump! Here, take this for it!\xe2\x80\x9d He brought out two pieces of\ngingerbread from his pocket and gave them to her.\n\nThe dumb woman\xe2\x80\x99s face flushed with pleasure, and she began making a\nweird noise for joy. Having seized the gingerbread she began to\ngesticulate still more rapidly, frequently pointing in one direction\nand passing her thick finger over her eyebrows and her face. Luk\xc3\xa1shka\nunderstood her and kept nodding, while he smiled slightly. She was\ntelling him to give the girls dainties, and that the girls liked him,\nand that one girl, Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x94the best of them all\xe2\x80\x94loved him. She\nindicated Mary\xc3\xa1nka by rapidly pointing in the direction of Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s\nhome and to her own eyebrows and face, and by smacking her lips and\nswaying her head. \xe2\x80\x9cLoves\xe2\x80\x9d she expressed by pressing her hands to her\nbreast, kissing her hand, and pretending to embrace someone. Their\nmother returned to the hut, and seeing what her dumb daughter was\nsaying, smiled and shook her head. Her daughter showed her the\ngingerbread and again made the noise which expressed joy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told Ul\xc3\xadtka the other day that I\xe2\x80\x99d send a matchmaker to them,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nthe mother. \xe2\x80\x9cShe took my words well.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka looked silently at his mother.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how about selling the wine, mother? I need a horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll cart it when I have time. I must get the barrels ready,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\nmother, evidently not wishing her son to meddle in domestic matters.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you go out you\xe2\x80\x99ll find a bag in the passage. I borrowed from the\nneighbours and got something for you to take back to the cordon; or\nshall I put it in your saddle-bag?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Luk\xc3\xa1shka. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if Gir\xc3\xa9y Khan should come across\nthe river send him to me at the cordon, for I shan\xe2\x80\x99t get leave again\nfor a long time now; I have some business with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe began to get ready to start.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will send him on,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems you have been\nspreeing at Y\xc3\xa1mka\xe2\x80\x99s all the time. I went out in the night to see the\ncattle, and I think it was your voice I heard singing songs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka did not reply, but went out into the passage, threw the bags\nover his shoulder, tucked up the skirts of his coat, took his musket,\nand then stopped for a moment on the threshold.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, mother!\xe2\x80\x9d he said as he closed the gate behind him. \xe2\x80\x9cSend me\na small barrel with Naz\xc3\xa1rka. I promised it to the lads, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll call\nfor it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay Christ keep you, Luk\xc3\xa1shka. God be with you! I\xe2\x80\x99ll send you some,\nsome from the new barrel,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, going to the fence: \xe2\x80\x9cBut\nlisten,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, leaning over the fence.\n\nThe Cossack stopped.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been making merry here; well, that\xe2\x80\x99s all right. Why should not\na young man amuse himself? God has sent you luck and that\xe2\x80\x99s good. But\nnow look out and mind, my son. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you go and get into mischief.\nAbove all, satisfy your superiors: one has to! And I will sell the wine\nand find money for a horse and will arrange a match with the girl for\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, all right!\xe2\x80\x9d answered her son, frowning.\n\nHis deaf sister shouted to attract his attention. She pointed to her\nhead and the palm of her hand, to indicate the shaved head of a\nCh\xc3\xa9chen. Then she frowned, and pretending to aim with a gun, she\nshrieked and began rapidly humming and shaking her head. This meant\nthat Luk\xc3\xa1shka should kill another Ch\xc3\xa9chen.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka understood. He smiled, and shifting the gun at his back under\nhis cloak stepped lightly and rapidly, and soon disappeared in the\nthick mist.\n\nThe old woman, having stood a little while at the gate, returned\nsilently to the hut and immediately began working.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XVIII\n\n\nLukasha returned to the cordon and at the same time Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka\nwhistled to his dogs and, climbing over his wattle fence, went to\nOl\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s lodging, passing by the back of the houses (he disliked\nmeeting women before going out hunting or shooting). He found Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nstill asleep, and even Vany\xc3\xbasha, though awake, was still in bed and\nlooking round the room considering whether it was not time to get up,\nwhen Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka, gun on shoulder and in full hunter\xe2\x80\x99s trappings,\nopened the door.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA cudgel!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted in his deep voice. \xe2\x80\x9cAn alarm! The Ch\xc3\xa9chens are\nupon us! Iv\xc3\xa1n! Get the samovar ready for your master, and get up\nyourself\xe2\x80\x94quick,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s our way, my good man! Why\neven the girls are already up! Look out of the window. See, she\xe2\x80\x99s going\nfor water and you\xe2\x80\x99re still sleeping!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin awoke and jumped up, feeling fresh and lighthearted at the sight\nof the old man and at the sound of his voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuick, Vany\xc3\xbasha, quick!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that the way you go hunting?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cOthers are having\ntheir breakfast and you are asleep! Lyam! Here!\xe2\x80\x9d he called to his dog.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs your gun ready?\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, as loud as if a whole crowd were in\nthe hut.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s true I\xe2\x80\x99m guilty, but it can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped! The powder,\nVany\xc3\xbasha, and the wads!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fine!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the old man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Du tay voulay vou?_\xe2\x80\x9d asked Vany\xc3\xbasha, grinning.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not one of us\xe2\x80\x94your gabble is not like our speech, you devil!\xe2\x80\x9d\nthe old man shouted at Vany\xc3\xbasha, showing the stumps of his teeth.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA first offence must be forgiven,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin playfully, drawing on\nhis high boots.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first offence shall be forgiven,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Er\xc3\xb3shka, \xe2\x80\x9cbut if you\noversleep another time you\xe2\x80\x99ll be fined a pail of _chikhir_. When it\ngets warmer you won\xe2\x80\x99t find the deer.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd even if we do find him he is wiser than we are,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin,\nrepeating the words spoken by the old man the evening before, \xe2\x80\x9cand you\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t deceive him!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, laugh away! You kill one first, and then you may talk. Now then,\nhurry up! Look, there\xe2\x80\x99s the master himself coming to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d added\nEr\xc3\xb3shka, looking out of the window. \xe2\x80\x9cJust see how he\xe2\x80\x99s got himself up.\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s put on a new coat so that you should see that he\xe2\x80\x99s an officer. Ah,\nthese people, these people!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSure enough Vany\xc3\xbasha came in and announced that the master of the house\nwished to see Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_L\xe2\x80\x99arjan!_\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked profoundly, to forewarn his master of the\nmeaning of this visitation. Following him, the master of the house in a\nnew Circassian coat with an officer\xe2\x80\x99s stripes on the shoulders and with\npolished boots (quite exceptional among Cossacks) entered the room,\nswaying from side to side, and congratulated his lodger on his safe\narrival.\n\nThe cornet, Elias Vas\xc3\xadlich, was an _educated_ Cossack. He had been to\nRussia proper, was a regimental schoolteacher, and above all he was\nnoble. He wished to appear noble, but one could not help feeling\nbeneath his grotesque pretence of polish, his affectation, his\nself-confidence, and his absurd way of speaking, he was just the same\nas Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka. This could also be clearly seen by his sunburnt face\nand his hands and his red nose. Ol\xc3\xa9nin asked him to sit down.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, Father Elias Vas\xc3\xadlich,\xe2\x80\x9d said Er\xc3\xb3shka, rising with (or so\nit seemed to Ol\xc3\xa9nin) an ironically low bow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning. Daddy. So you\xe2\x80\x99re here already,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cornet, with a\ncareless nod.\n\nThe cornet was a man of about forty, with a grey pointed beard, skinny\nand lean, but handsome and very fresh-looking for his age. Having come\nto see Ol\xc3\xa9nin he was evidently afraid of being taken for an ordinary\nCossack, and wanted to let Ol\xc3\xa9nin feel his importance from the first.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s our Egyptian Nimrod,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, addressing Ol\xc3\xa9nin and\npointing to the old man with a self-satisfied smile. \xe2\x80\x9cA mighty hunter\nbefore the Lord! He\xe2\x80\x99s our foremost man on every hand. You\xe2\x80\x99ve already\nbeen pleased to get acquainted with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDaddy Er\xc3\xb3shka gazed at his feet in their shoes of wet raw hide and\nshook his head thoughtfully at the cornet\xe2\x80\x99s ability and learning, and\nmuttered to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cGyptian Nimvrod! What things he invents!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you see we mean to go hunting,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, exactly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cornet, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have a small business with\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeeing that you are a gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d began the cornet, \xe2\x80\x9cand as I may\nunderstand myself to be in the rank of an officer too, and therefore we\nmay always progressively negotiate, as gentlemen do.\xe2\x80\x9d (He stopped and\nlooked with a smile at Ol\xc3\xa9nin and at the old man.) \xe2\x80\x9cBut if you have the\ndesire with my consent, then, as my wife is a foolish woman of our\nclass, she could not quite comprehend your words of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s date.\nTherefore my quarters might be let for six rubles to the Regimental\nAdjutant, without the stables; but I can always avert that from myself\nfree of charge. But, as you desire, therefore I, being myself of an\nofficer\xe2\x80\x99s rank, can come to an agreement with you in everything\npersonally, as an inhabitant of this district, not according to our\ncustoms, but can maintain the conditions in every way....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeaks clearly!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the old man.\n\nThe cornet continued in the same strain for a long time. At last, not\nwithout difficulty, Ol\xc3\xa9nin gathered that the cornet wished to let his\nrooms to him, Ol\xc3\xa9nin, for six rubles a month. The latter gladly agreed\nto this, and offered his visitor a glass of tea. The cornet declined\nit.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAccording to our silly custom we consider it a sort of sin to drink\nout of a \xe2\x80\x98worldly\xe2\x80\x99 tumbler,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThough, of course, with my\neducation I may understand, but my wife from her human weakness...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, will you have some tea?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you will permit me, I will bring my own particular glass,\xe2\x80\x9d answered\nthe cornet, and stepped out into the porch.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring me my glass!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\n\nIn a few minutes the door opened and a young sunburnt arm in a print\nsleeve thrust itself in, holding a tumbler in the hand. The cornet went\nup, took it, and whispered something to his daughter. Ol\xc3\xa9nin poured tea\nfor the cornet into the latter\xe2\x80\x99s own \xe2\x80\x9cparticular\xe2\x80\x9d glass, and for\nEr\xc3\xb3shka into a \xe2\x80\x9cworldly\xe2\x80\x9d glass.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, I do not desire to detain you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cornet, scalding his\nlips and emptying his tumbler. \xe2\x80\x9cI too have a great liking for fishing,\nand I am here, so to say, only on leave of absence for recreation from\nmy duties. I too have the desire to tempt fortune and see whether some\n_Gifts of the T\xc3\xa9rek_ may not fall to my share. I hope you too will come\nand see us and have a drink of our wine, according to the custom of our\nvillage,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\nThe cornet bowed, shook hands with Ol\xc3\xa9nin, and went out. While Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nwas getting ready, he heard the cornet giving orders to his family in\nan authoritative and sensible tone, and a few minutes later he saw him\npass by the window in a tattered coat with his trousers rolled up to\nhis knees and a fishing net over his shoulder.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA rascal!\xe2\x80\x9d said Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka, emptying his \xe2\x80\x9cworldly\xe2\x80\x9d tumbler. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\nwill you really pay him six rubles? Was such a thing ever heard of?\nThey would let you the best hut in the village for two rubles. What a\nbeast! Why, I\xe2\x80\x99d let you have mine for three!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99ll remain here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSix rubles!... Clearly it\xe2\x80\x99s a fool\xe2\x80\x99s money. Eh, eh, eh!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the\nold man. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s have some _chikhir_, Iv\xc3\xa1n!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHaving had a snack and a drink of vodka to prepare themselves for the\nroad, Ol\xc3\xa9nin and the old man went out together before eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\n\nAt the gate they came up against a wagon to which a pair of oxen were\nharnessed. With a white kerchief tied round her head down to her eyes,\na coat over her smock, and wearing high boots, Mary\xc3\xa1nka with a long\nswitch in her hand was dragging the oxen by a cord tied to their horns.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMammy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, pretending that he was going to seize her.\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka flourished her switch at him and glanced merrily at them both\nwith her beautiful eyes.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin felt still more light-hearted.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, come on, come on,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, throwing his gun on his shoulder\nand conscious of the girl\xe2\x80\x99s eyes upon him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGee up!\xe2\x80\x9d sounded Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s voice behind them, followed by the creak\nof the moving wagon.\n\nAs long as their road lay through the pastures at the back of the\nvillage Er\xc3\xb3shka went on talking. He could not forget the cornet and\nkept on abusing him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you so angry with him?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s stingy. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it\nall behind when he dies! Then who\xe2\x80\x99s he saving up for? He\xe2\x80\x99s built two\nhouses, and he\xe2\x80\x99s got a second garden from his brother by a law-suit.\nAnd in the matter of papers what a dog he is! They come to him from\nother villages to fill up documents. As he writes it out, exactly so it\nhappens. He gets it quite exact. But who is he saving for? He\xe2\x80\x99s only\ngot one boy and the girl; when she\xe2\x80\x99s married who\xe2\x80\x99ll be left?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, he\xe2\x80\x99s saving up for her dowry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat dowry? The girl is sought after, she\xe2\x80\x99s a fine girl. But he\xe2\x80\x99s such\na devil that he must yet marry her to a rich fellow. He wants to get a\nbig price for her. There\xe2\x80\x99s Luke, a Cossack, a neighbour and a nephew of\nmine, a fine lad. It\xe2\x80\x99s he who killed the Ch\xc3\xa9chen\xe2\x80\x94he has been wooing her\nfor a long time, but he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t let him have her. He\xe2\x80\x99s given one excuse,\nand another, and a third. \xe2\x80\x98The girl\xe2\x80\x99s too young,\xe2\x80\x99 he says. But I know\nwhat he is thinking. He wants to keep them bowing to him. He\xe2\x80\x99s been\nacting shamefully about that girl. Still, they will get her for\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka, because he is the best Cossack in the village, a brave, who\nhas killed an _abrek_ and will be rewarded with a cross.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how about this? When I was walking up and down the yard last\nnight, I saw my landlord\xe2\x80\x99s daughter and some Cossack kissing,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nOl\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re pretending!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old man, stopping.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn my word,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWomen are the devil,\xe2\x80\x9d said Er\xc3\xb3shka pondering. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what Cossack was\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what sort of a cap had he, a white one?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a red coat? About your height?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, a bit taller.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s he!\xe2\x80\x9d and Er\xc3\xb3shka burst out laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s himself, it\xe2\x80\x99s Mark. He\nis Luke, but I call him Mark for a joke. His very self! I love him. I\nwas just such a one myself. What\xe2\x80\x99s the good of minding them? My\nsweetheart used to sleep with her mother and her sister-in-law, but I\nmanaged to get in. She used to sleep upstairs; that witch her mother\nwas a regular demon; it\xe2\x80\x99s awful how she hated me. Well, I used to come\nwith a chum, G\xc3\xadrchik his name was. We\xe2\x80\x99d come under her window and I\xe2\x80\x99d\nclimb on his shoulders, push up the window and begin groping about. She\nused to sleep just there on a bench. Once I woke her up and she nearly\ncalled out. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t recognized me. \xe2\x80\x98Who is there?\xe2\x80\x99 she said, and I\ncould not answer. Her mother was even beginning to stir, but I took off\nmy cap and shoved it over her mouth; and she at once knew it by a seam\nin it, and ran out to me. I used not to want anything then. She\xe2\x80\x99d bring\nalong clotted cream and grapes and everything,\xe2\x80\x9d added Er\xc3\xb3shka (who\nalways explained things practically), \xe2\x80\x9cand she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only one. It\nwas a life!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what now?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we\xe2\x80\x99ll follow the dog, get a pheasant to settle on a tree, and then\nyou may fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you have made up to Mary\xc3\xa1nka?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAttend to the dogs. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, pointing\nto his favourite dog, Lyam.\n\nAfter a pause they continued talking, while they went about a hundred\npaces. Then the old man stopped again and pointed to a twig that lay\nacross the path.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of that?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou think it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing? It\xe2\x80\x99s bad\nthat this stick is lying so.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is it bad?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe smiled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything. Just listen to me. When a stick lies like\nthat don\xe2\x80\x99t you step across it, but go round it or throw it off the path\nthis way, and say \xe2\x80\x98Father and Son and Holy Ghost,\xe2\x80\x99 and then go on with\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s blessing. Nothing will happen to you. That\xe2\x80\x99s what the old men\nused to teach me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, what rubbish!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better tell me more about\nMary\xc3\xa1nka. Does she carry on with Luk\xc3\xa1shka?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush ... be quiet now!\xe2\x80\x9d the old man again interrupted in a whisper:\n\xe2\x80\x9cjust listen, we\xe2\x80\x99ll go round through the forest.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the old man, stepping quietly in his soft shoes, led the way by a\nnarrow path leading into the dense, wild, overgrown forest. Now and\nagain with a frown he turned to look at Ol\xc3\xa9nin, who rustled and\nclattered with his heavy boots and, carrying his gun carelessly,\nseveral times caught the twigs of trees that grew across the path.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t make a noise. Step softly, soldier!\xe2\x80\x9d the old man whispered\nangrily.\n\nThere was a feeling in the air that the sun had risen. The mist was\ndissolving but it still enveloped the tops of the trees. The forest\nlooked terribly high. At every step the aspect changed: what had\nappeared like a tree proved to be a bush, and a reed looked like a\ntree.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XIX\n\n\nThe mist had partly lifted, showing the wet reed thatches, and was now\nturning into dew that moistened the road and the grass beside the\nfence. Smoke rose everywhere in clouds from the chimneys. The people\nwere going out of the village, some to their work, some to the river,\nand some to the cordon. The hunters walked together along the damp,\ngrass-grown path. The dogs, wagging their tails and looking at their\nmasters, ran on both sides of them. Myriads of gnats hovered in the air\nand pursued the hunters, covering their backs, eyes, and hands. The air\nwas fragrant with the grass and with the dampness of the forest. Ol\xc3\xa9nin\ncontinually looked round at the ox-cart in which Mary\xc3\xa1nka sat urging on\nthe oxen with a long switch.\n\nIt was calm. The sounds from the village, audible at first, now no\nlonger reached the sportsmen. Only the brambles cracked as the dogs ran\nunder them, and now and then birds called to one another. Ol\xc3\xa9nin knew\nthat danger lurked in the forest, that _abreks_ always hid in such\nplaces. But he knew too that in the forest, for a man on foot, a gun is\na great protection. Not that he was afraid, but he felt that another in\nhis place might be; and looking into the damp misty forest and\nlistening to the rare and faint sounds with strained attention, he\nchanged his hold on his gun and experienced a pleasant feeling that was\nnew to him. Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka went in front, stopping and carefully\nscanning every puddle where an animal had left a double track, and\npointing it out to Ol\xc3\xa9nin. He hardly spoke at all and only occasionally\nmade remarks in a whisper. The track they were following had once been\nmade by wagons, but the grass had long overgrown it. The elm and\nplane-tree forest on both sides of them was so dense and overgrown with\ncreepers that it was impossible to see anything through it. Nearly\nevery tree was enveloped from top to bottom with wild grape vines, and\ndark bramble bushes covered the ground thickly. Every little glade was\novergrown with blackberry bushes and grey feathery reeds. In places,\nlarge hoof-prints and small funnel-shaped pheasant-trails led from the\npath into the thicket. The vigour of the growth of this forest,\nuntrampled by cattle, struck Ol\xc3\xa9nin at every turn, for he had never\nseen anything like it. This forest, the danger, the old man and his\nmysterious whispering, Mary\xc3\xa1nka with her virile upright bearing, and\nthe mountains\xe2\x80\x94all this seemed to him like a dream.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA pheasant has settled,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the old man, looking round and\npulling his cap over his face\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cCover your mug! A pheasant!\xe2\x80\x9d he waved\nhis arm angrily at Ol\xc3\xa9nin and pushed forward almost on all fours. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t like a man\xe2\x80\x99s mug.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin was still behind him when the old man stopped and began\nexamining a tree. A cock-pheasant on the tree clucked at the dog that\nwas barking at it, and Ol\xc3\xa9nin saw the pheasant; but at that moment a\nreport, as of a cannon, came from Er\xc3\xb3shka\xe2\x80\x99s enormous gun, the bird\nfluttered up and, losing some feathers, fell to the ground. Coming up\nto the old man Ol\xc3\xa9nin disturbed another, and raising his gun he aimed\nand fired. The pheasant flew swiftly up and then, catching at the\nbranches as he fell, dropped like a stone to the ground.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood man!\xe2\x80\x9d the old man (who could not hit a flying bird) shouted,\nlaughing.\n\nHaving picked up the pheasants they went on. Ol\xc3\xa9nin, excited by the\nexercise and the praise, kept addressing remarks to the old man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop! Come this way,\xe2\x80\x9d the old man interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cI noticed the track of\ndeer here yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAfter they had turned into the thicket and gone some three hundred\npaces they scrambled through into a glade overgrown with reeds and\npartly under water. Ol\xc3\xa9nin failed to keep up with the old huntsman and\npresently Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka, some twenty paces in front, stooped down,\nnodding and beckoning with his arm. On coming up with him Ol\xc3\xa9nin saw a\nman\xe2\x80\x99s footprint to which the old man was pointing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you see?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, well?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin, trying to speak as calmly as he could. \xe2\x80\x9cA\nman\xe2\x80\x99s footstep!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nInvoluntarily a thought of Cooper\xe2\x80\x99s _Pathfinder_ and of _abreks_\nflashed through Ol\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s mind, but noticing the mysterious manner with\nwhich the old man moved on, he hesitated to question him and remained\nin doubt whether this mysteriousness was caused by fear of danger or by\nthe sport.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it\xe2\x80\x99s my own footprint,\xe2\x80\x9d the old man said quietly, and pointed to\nsome grass under which the track of an animal was just perceptible.\n\nThe old man went on, and Ol\xc3\xa9nin kept up with him. Descending to lower\nground some twenty paces farther on they came upon a spreading\npear-tree, under which, on the black earth, lay the fresh dung of some\nanimal.\n\nThe spot, all covered over with wild vines, was like a cosy arbour,\ndark and cool.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been here this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man with a sigh; \xe2\x80\x9cthe lair\nis still damp, quite fresh.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSuddenly they heard a terrible crash in the forest some ten paces from\nwhere they stood. They both started and seized their guns, but they\ncould see nothing and only heard the branches breaking. The rhythmical\nrapid thud of galloping was heard for a moment and then changed into a\nhollow rumble which resounded farther and farther off, re-echoing in\nwider and wider circles through the forest. Ol\xc3\xa9nin felt as though\nsomething had snapped in his heart. He peered carefully but vainly into\nthe green thicket and then turned to the old man. Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka with\nhis gun pressed to his breast stood motionless; his cap was thrust\nbackwards, his eyes gleamed with an unwonted glow, and his open mouth,\nwith its worn yellow teeth, seemed to have stiffened in that position.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA horned stag!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, and throwing down his gun in despair he\nbegan pulling at his grey beard, \xe2\x80\x9cHere it stood. We should have come\nround by the path.... Fool! fool!\xe2\x80\x9d and he gave his beard an angry tug.\n\xe2\x80\x9cFool! Pig!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, pulling painfully at his own beard. Through\nthe forest something seemed to fly away in the mist, and ever farther\nand farther off was heard the sound of the flight of the stag.\n\nIt was already dusk when, hungry, tired, but full of vigour, Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nreturned with the old man. Dinner was ready. He ate and drank with the\nold man till he felt warm and merry. Ol\xc3\xa9nin then went out into the\nporch. Again, to the west, the mountains rose before his eyes. Again\nthe old man told his endless stories of hunting, of _abreks_, of\nsweethearts, and of all that free and reckless life. Again the fair\nMary\xc3\xa1nka went in and out and across the yard, her beautiful powerful\nform outlined by her smock.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XX\n\n\nThe next day Ol\xc3\xa9nin went alone to the spot where he and the old man\nstartled the stag. Instead of passing round through the gate he climbed\nover the prickly hedge, as everybody else did, and before he had had\ntime to pull out the thorns that had caught in his coat, his dog, which\nhad run on in front, started two pheasants. He had hardly stepped among\nthe briers when the pheasants began to rise at every step (the old man\nhad not shown him that place the day before as he meant to keep it for\nshooting from behind the screen). Ol\xc3\xa9nin fired twelve times and killed\nfive pheasants, but clambering after them through the briers he got so\nfatigued that he was drenched with perspiration. He called off his dog,\nuncocked his gun, put in a bullet above the small shot, and brushing\naway the mosquitoes with the wide sleeve of his Circassian coat he went\nslowly to the spot where they had been the day before. It was however\nimpossible to keep back the dog, who found trails on the very path, and\nOl\xc3\xa9nin killed two more pheasants, so that after being detained by this\nit was getting towards noon before he began to find the place he was\nlooking for.\n\nThe day was perfectly clear, calm, and hot. The morning moisture had\ndried up even in the forest, and myriads of mosquitoes literally\ncovered his face, his back, and his arms. His dog had turned from black\nto grey, its back being covered with mosquitoes, and so had Ol\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s\ncoat through which the insects thrust their stings. Ol\xc3\xa9nin was ready to\nrun away from them and it seemed to him that it was impossible to live\nin this country in the summer. He was about to go home, but remembering\nthat other people managed to endure such pain he resolved to bear it\nand gave himself up to be devoured. And strange to say, by noontime the\nfeeling became actually pleasant. He even felt that without this\nmosquito-filled atmosphere around him, and that mosquito-paste mingled\nwith perspiration which his hand smeared over his face, and that\nunceasing irritation all over his body, the forest would lose for him\nsome of its character and charm. These myriads of insects were so well\nsuited to that monstrously lavish wild vegetation, these multitudes of\nbirds and beasts which filled the forest, this dark foliage, this hot\nscented air, these runlets filled with turbid water which everywhere\nsoaked through from the T\xc3\xa9rek and gurgled here and there under the\noverhanging leaves, that the very thing which had at first seemed to\nhim dreadful and intolerable now seemed pleasant. After going round the\nplace where yesterday they had found the animal and not finding\nanything, he felt inclined to rest. The sun stood right above the\nforest and poured its perpendicular rays down on his back and head\nwhenever he came out into a glade or onto the road. The seven heavy\npheasants dragged painfully at his waist. Having found the traces of\nyesterday\xe2\x80\x99s stag he crept under a bush into the thicket just where the\nstag had lain, and lay down in its lair. He examined the dark foliage\naround him, the place marked by the stag\xe2\x80\x99s perspiration and yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s\ndung, the imprint of the stag\xe2\x80\x99s knees, the bit of black earth it had\nkicked up, and his own footprints of the day before. He felt cool and\ncomfortable and did not think of or wish for anything. And suddenly he\nwas overcome by such a strange feeling of causeless joy and of love for\neverything, that from an old habit of his childhood he began crossing\nhimself and thanking someone. Suddenly, with extraordinary clearness,\nhe thought: \xe2\x80\x9cHere am I, Dm\xc3\xadtri Ol\xc3\xa9nin, a being quite distinct from\nevery other being, now lying all alone Heaven only knows where\xe2\x80\x94where a\nstag used to live\xe2\x80\x94an old stag, a beautiful stag who perhaps had never\nseen a man, and in a place where no human being has ever sat or thought\nthese thoughts. Here I sit, and around me stand old and young trees,\none of them festooned with wild grape vines, and pheasants are\nfluttering, driving one another about and perhaps scenting their\nmurdered brothers.\xe2\x80\x9d He felt his pheasants, examined them, and wiped the\nwarm blood off his hand onto his coat. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps the jackals scent them\nand with dissatisfied faces go off in another direction: above me,\nflying in among the leaves which to them seem enormous islands,\nmosquitoes hang in the air and buzz: one, two, three, four, a hundred,\na thousand, a million mosquitoes, and all of them buzz something or\nother and each one of them is separate from all else and is just such a\nseparate Dm\xc3\xadtri Ol\xc3\xa9nin as I am myself.\xe2\x80\x9d He vividly imagined what the\nmosquitoes buzzed: \xe2\x80\x9cThis way, this way, lads! Here\xe2\x80\x99s some one we can\neat!\xe2\x80\x9d They buzzed and stuck to him. And it was clear to him that he was\nnot a Russian nobleman, a member of Moscow society, the friend and\nrelation of so-and-so and so-and-so, but just such a mosquito, or\npheasant, or deer, as those that were now living all around him. \xe2\x80\x9cJust\nas they, just as Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka, I shall live awhile and die, and as he\nsays truly: \xe2\x80\x98grass will grow and nothing more\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what though the grass does grow?\xe2\x80\x9d he continued thinking. \xe2\x80\x9cStill I\nmust live and be happy, because happiness is all I desire. Never mind\nwhat I am\xe2\x80\x94an animal like all the rest, above whom the grass will grow\nand nothing more; or a frame in which a bit of the one God has been\nset,\xe2\x80\x94still I must live in the very best way. How then must I live to be\nhappy, and why was I not happy before?\xe2\x80\x9d And he began to recall his\nformer life and he felt disgusted with himself. He appeared to himself\nto have been terribly exacting and selfish, though he now saw that all\nthe while he really needed nothing for himself. And he looked round at\nthe foliage with the light shining through it, at the setting sun and\nthe clear sky, and he felt just as happy as before. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy am I happy,\nand what used I to live for?\xe2\x80\x9d thought he. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much I exacted for\nmyself; how I schemed and did not manage to gain anything but shame and\nsorrow! and, there now, I require nothing to be happy;\xe2\x80\x9d and suddenly a\nnew light seemed to reveal itself to him. \xe2\x80\x9cHappiness is this!\xe2\x80\x9d he said\nto himself. \xe2\x80\x9cHappiness lies in living for others. That is evident. The\ndesire for happiness is innate in every man; therefore it is\nlegitimate. When trying to satisfy it selfishly\xe2\x80\x94that is, by seeking for\noneself riches, fame, comforts, or love\xe2\x80\x94it may happen that\ncircumstances arise which make it impossible to satisfy these desires.\nIt follows that it is these desires that are illegitimate, but not the\nneed for happiness. But what desires can always be satisfied despite\nexternal circumstances? What are they? Love, self-sacrifice.\xe2\x80\x9d He was so\nglad and excited when he had discovered this, as it seemed to him, new\ntruth, that he jumped up and began impatiently seeking some one to\nsacrifice himself for, to do good to and to love. \xe2\x80\x9cSince one wants\nnothing for oneself,\xe2\x80\x9d he kept thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy not live for others?\xe2\x80\x9d He\ntook up his gun with the intention of returning home quickly to think\nthis out and to find an opportunity of doing good. He made his way out\nof the thicket. When he had come out into the glade he looked around\nhim; the sun was no longer visible above the tree-tops. It had grown\ncooler and the place seemed to him quite strange and not like the\ncountry round the village. Everything seemed changed\xe2\x80\x94the weather and\nthe character of the forest; the sky was wrapped in clouds, the wind\nwas rustling in the tree-tops, and all around nothing was visible but\nreeds and dying broken-down trees. He called to his dog who had run\naway to follow some animal, and his voice came back as in a desert. And\nsuddenly he was seized with a terrible sense of weirdness. He grew\nfrightened. He remembered the _abreks_ and the murders he had been told\nabout, and he expected every moment that an _abrek_ would spring from\nbehind every bush and he would have to defend his life and die, or be a\ncoward. He thought of God and of the future life as for long he had not\nthought about them. And all around was that same gloomy stern wild\nnature. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd is it worth while living for oneself,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen\nat any moment you may die, and die without having done any good, and so\nthat no one will know of it?\xe2\x80\x9d He went in the direction where he fancied\nthe village lay. Of his shooting he had no further thought; but he felt\ntired to death and peered round at every bush and tree with particular\nattention and almost with terror, expecting every moment to be called\nto account for his life. After having wandered about for a considerable\ntime he came upon a ditch down which was flowing cold sandy water from\nthe T\xc3\xa9rek, and, not to go astray any longer, he decided to follow it.\nHe went on without knowing where the ditch would lead him. Suddenly the\nreeds behind him crackled. He shuddered and seized his gun, and then\nfelt ashamed of himself: the over-excited dog, panting hard, had thrown\nitself into the cold water of the ditch and was lapping it!\n\nHe too had a drink, and then followed the dog in the direction it\nwished to go, thinking it would lead him to the village. But despite\nthe dog\xe2\x80\x99s company everything around him seemed still more dreary. The\nforest grew darker and the wind grew stronger and stronger in the tops\nof the broken old trees. Some large birds circled screeching round\ntheir nests in those trees. The vegetation grew poorer and he came\noftener and oftener upon rustling reeds and bare sandy spaces covered\nwith animal footprints. To the howling of the wind was added another\nkind of cheerless monotonous roar. Altogether his spirits became\ngloomy. Putting his hand behind him he felt his pheasants, and found\none missing. It had broken off and was lost, and only the bleeding head\nand beak remained sticking in his belt. He felt more frightened than he\nhad ever done before. He began to pray to God, and feared above all\nthat he might die without having done anything good or kind; and he so\nwanted to live, and to live so as to perform a feat of self-sacrifice.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXI\n\n\nSuddenly it was as though the sun had shone into his soul. He heard\nRussian being spoken, and also heard the rapid smooth flow of the\nT\xc3\xa9rek, and a few steps farther in front of him saw the brown moving\nsurface of the river, with the dim-coloured wet sand of its banks and\nshallows, the distant steppe, the cordon watch-tower outlined above the\nwater, a saddled and hobbled horse among the brambles, and then the\nmountains opening out before him. The red sun appeared for an instant\nfrom under a cloud and its last rays glittered brightly along the river\nover the reeds, on the watch-tower, and on a group of Cossacks, among\nwhom Luk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s vigorous figure attracted Ol\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s involuntary\nattention.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin felt that he was again, without any apparent cause, perfectly\nhappy. He had come upon the N\xc3\xadzhni-Prot\xc3\xb3tsk post on the T\xc3\xa9rek, opposite\na pro-Russian Tartar village on the other side of the river. He\naccosted the Cossacks, but not finding as yet any excuse for doing\nanyone a kindness, he entered the hut; nor in the hut did he find any\nsuch opportunity. The Cossacks received him coldly. On entering the mud\nhut he lit a cigarette. The Cossacks paid little attention to him,\nfirst because he was smoking a cigarette, and secondly because they had\nsomething else to divert them that evening. Some hostile Ch\xc3\xa9chens,\nrelatives of the _abrek_ who had been killed, had come from the hills\nwith a scout to ransom the body; and the Cossacks were waiting for\ntheir Commanding Officer\xe2\x80\x99s arrival from the village. The dead man\xe2\x80\x99s\nbrother, tall and well shaped with a short cropped beard which was dyed\nred, despite his very tattered coat and cap was calm and majestic as a\nking. His face was very like that of the dead _abrek_. He did not deign\nto look at anyone, and never once glanced at the dead body, but sitting\non his heels in the shade he spat as he smoked his short pipe, and\noccasionally uttered some few guttural sounds of command, which were\nrespectfully listened to by his companion. He was evidently a brave who\nhad met Russians more than once before in quite other circumstances,\nand nothing about them could astonish or even interest him. Ol\xc3\xa9nin was\nabout to approach the dead body and had begun to look at it when the\nbrother, looking up at him from under his brows with calm contempt,\nsaid something sharply and angrily. The scout hastened to cover the\ndead man\xe2\x80\x99s face with his coat. Ol\xc3\xa9nin was struck by the dignified and\nstern expression of the brave\xe2\x80\x99s face. He began to speak to him, asking\nfrom what village he came, but the Ch\xc3\xa9chen, scarcely giving him a\nglance, spat contemptuously and turned away. Ol\xc3\xa9nin was so surprised at\nthe Ch\xc3\xa9chen not being interested in him that he could only put it down\nto the man\xe2\x80\x99s stupidity or ignorance of Russian; so he turned to the\nscout, who also acted as interpreter. The scout was as ragged as the\nother, but instead of being red-haired he was black-haired, restless,\nwith extremely white gleaming teeth and sparkling black eyes. The scout\nwillingly entered into conversation and asked for a cigarette.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were five brothers,\xe2\x80\x9d began the scout in his broken Russian.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the third brother the Russians have killed, only two are left.\nHe is a brave, a great brave!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pointing to the Ch\xc3\xa9chen. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen\nthey killed Ahmet Khan (the dead brave) this one was sitting on the\nopposite bank among the reeds. He saw it all. Saw him laid in the skiff\nand brought to the bank. He sat there till the night and wished to kill\nthe old man, but the others would not let him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka went up to the speaker, and sat down. \xe2\x80\x9cOf what village?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\nhe.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom there in the hills,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the scout, pointing to the misty\nbluish gorge beyond the T\xc3\xa9rek. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know Suuk-su? It is about eight\nmiles beyond that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know Gir\xc3\xa9y Khan in Suuk-su?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Luk\xc3\xa1shka, evidently proud of\nthe acquaintance. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is my _kunak_.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is my neighbour,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the scout.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a trump!\xe2\x80\x9d and Luk\xc3\xa1shka, evidently much interested, began talking\nto the scout in Tartar.\n\nPresently a Cossack captain, with the head of the village, arrived on\nhorseback with a suite of two Cossacks. The captain\xe2\x80\x94one of the new type\nof Cossack officers\xe2\x80\x94wished the Cossacks \xe2\x80\x9cGood health,\xe2\x80\x9d but no one\nshouted in reply, \xe2\x80\x9cHail! Good health to your honour,\xe2\x80\x9d as is customary\nin the Russian Army, and only a few replied with a bow. Some, and among\nthem Luk\xc3\xa1shka, rose and stood erect. The corporal replied that all was\nwell at the outposts. All this seemed ridiculous: it was as if these\nCossacks were playing at being soldiers. But these formalities soon\ngave place to ordinary ways of behaviour, and the captain, who was a\nsmart Cossack just like the others, began speaking fluently in Tartar\nto the interpreter. They filled in some document, gave it to the scout,\nand received from him some money. Then they approached the body.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich of you is Luke Gavr\xc3\xadlov?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the captain.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka took off his cap and came forward.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have reported your exploit to the Commander. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what will\ncome of it. I have recommended you for a cross; you\xe2\x80\x99re too young to be\nmade a sergeant. Can you read?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what a fine fellow to look at!\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, again playing\nthe commander. \xe2\x80\x9cPut on your cap. Which of the Gavr\xc3\xadlovs does he come\nof? ... the Broad, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis nephew,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the corporal.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, I know. Well, lend a hand, help them,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning to the\nCossacks.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s face shone with joy and seemed handsomer than usual. He\nmoved away from the corporal, and having put on his cap sat down beside\nOl\xc3\xa9nin.\n\nWhen the body had been carried to the skiff the brother Ch\xc3\xa9chen\ndescended to the bank. The Cossacks involuntarily stepped aside to let\nhim pass. He jumped into the boat and pushed off from the bank with his\npowerful leg, and now, as Ol\xc3\xa9nin noticed, for the first time threw a\nrapid glance at all the Cossacks and then abruptly asked his companion\na question. The latter answered something and pointed to Luk\xc3\xa1shka. The\nCh\xc3\xa9chen looked at him and, turning slowly away, gazed at the opposite\nbank. That look expressed not hatred but cold contempt. He again made\nsome remark.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is he saying?\xe2\x80\x9d Ol\xc3\xa9nin asked of the fidgety scout.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYours kill ours, ours slay yours. It\xe2\x80\x99s always the same,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the\nscout, evidently inventing, and he smiled, showing his white teeth, as\nhe jumped into the skiff.\n\nThe dead man\xe2\x80\x99s brother sat motionless, gazing at the opposite bank. He\nwas so full of hatred and contempt that there was nothing on this side\nof the river that moved his curiosity. The scout, standing up at one\nend of the skiff and dipping his paddle now on one side now on the\nother, steered skilfully while talking incessantly. The skiff became\nsmaller and smaller as it moved obliquely across the stream, the voices\nbecame scarcely audible, and at last, still within sight, they landed\non the opposite bank where their horses stood waiting. There they\nlifted out the corpse and (though the horse shied) laid it across one\nof the saddles, mounted, and rode at a foot-pace along the road past a\nTartar village from which a crowd came out to look at them. The\nCossacks on the Russian side of the river were highly satisfied and\njovial. Laughter and jokes were heard on all sides. The captain and the\nhead of the village entered the mud hut to regale themselves. Luk\xc3\xa1shka,\nvainly striving to impart a sedate expression to his merry face, sat\ndown with his elbows on his knees beside Ol\xc3\xa9nin and whittled away at a\nstick.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you smoke?\xe2\x80\x9d he said with assumed curiosity. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it good?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe evidently spoke because he noticed Ol\xc3\xa9nin felt ill at ease and\nisolated among the Cossacks.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just a habit,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ol\xc3\xa9nin. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m, if one of us were to smoke there would be a row! Look there now,\nthe mountains are not far off,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Luk\xc3\xa1shka, \xe2\x80\x9cyet you can\xe2\x80\x99t get\nthere! How will you get back alone? It\xe2\x80\x99s getting dark. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you,\nif you like. You ask the corporal to give me leave.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fine fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Ol\xc3\xa9nin, looking at the Cossack\xe2\x80\x99s bright\nface. He remembered Mary\xc3\xa1nka and the kiss he had heard by the gate, and\nhe was sorry for Luk\xc3\xa1shka and his want of culture. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat confusion it\nis,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cA man kills another and is happy and satisfied with\nhimself as if he had done something excellent. Can it be that nothing\ntells him that it is not a reason for any rejoicing, and that happiness\nlies not in killing, but in sacrificing oneself?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you had better not meet him again now, mate!\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the\nCossacks who had seen the skiff off, addressing Luk\xc3\xa1shka. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear\nhim asking about you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka raised his head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy godson?\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, meaning by that word the dead Ch\xc3\xa9chen.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour godson won\xe2\x80\x99t rise, but the red one is the godson\xe2\x80\x99s brother!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him thank God that he got off whole himself,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Luk\xc3\xa1shka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you glad about?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin. \xe2\x80\x9cSupposing your brother had\nbeen killed; would you be glad?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Cossack looked at Ol\xc3\xa9nin with laughing eyes. He seemed to have\nunderstood all that Ol\xc3\xa9nin wished to say to him, but to be above such\nconsiderations.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that happens too! Don\xe2\x80\x99t our fellows get killed sometimes?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXII\n\n\nThe Captain and the head of the village rode away, and Ol\xc3\xa9nin, to\nplease Luk\xc3\xa1shka as well as to avoid going back alone through the dark\nforest, asked the corporal to give Luk\xc3\xa1shka leave, and the corporal did\nso. Ol\xc3\xa9nin thought that Luk\xc3\xa1shka wanted to see Mary\xc3\xa1nka and he was also\nglad of the companionship of such a pleasant-looking and sociable\nCossack. Luk\xc3\xa1shka and Mary\xc3\xa1nka he involuntarily united in his mind, and\nhe found pleasure in thinking about them. \xe2\x80\x9cHe loves Mary\xc3\xa1nka,\xe2\x80\x9d thought\nOl\xc3\xa9nin, \xe2\x80\x9cand I could love her,\xe2\x80\x9d and a new and powerful emotion of\ntenderness overcame him as they walked homewards together through the\ndark forest. Luk\xc3\xa1shka too felt happy; something akin to love made\nitself felt between these two very different young men. Every time they\nglanced at one another they wanted to laugh.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy which gate do you enter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the middle one. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you as far as the marsh. After that\nyou have nothing to fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin laughed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I am afraid? Go back, and thank you. I can get on alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right! What have I to do? And how can you help being afraid?\nEven we are afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka to set Ol\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s self-esteem at rest,\nand he laughed too.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen come in with me. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have a talk and a drink and in the morning\nyou can go back.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I find a place to spend the night?\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Luk\xc3\xa1shka. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\nthe corporal asked me to go back.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard you singing last night, and also saw you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery one...\xe2\x80\x9d and Luke swayed his head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it true you are getting married?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother wants me to marry. But I have not got a horse yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you in the regular service?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear no! I\xe2\x80\x99ve only just joined, and have not got a horse yet, and\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know how to get one. That\xe2\x80\x99s why the marriage does not come off.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what would a horse cost?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were bargaining for one beyond the river the other day and they\nwould not take sixty rubles for it, though it is a Nog\xc3\xa1y horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you come and be my drab\xc3\xa1nt?\xe2\x80\x9d (A drab\xc3\xa1nt was a kind of orderly\nattached to an officer when campaigning.) \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll get it arranged and\nwill give you a horse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cReally now, I have two\nand I don\xe2\x80\x99t want both.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t want it?\xe2\x80\x9d Luk\xc3\xa1shka said, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should you make me a\npresent? We\xe2\x80\x99ll get on by ourselves by God\xe2\x80\x99s help.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, really! Or don\xe2\x80\x99t you want to be a drab\xc3\xa1nt?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin, glad that\nit had entered his head to give a horse to Luk\xc3\xa1shka, though, without\nknowing why, he felt uncomfortable and confused and did not know what\nto say when he tried to speak.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka was the first to break the silence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you a house of your own in Russia?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin could not refrain from replying that he had not only one, but\nseveral houses.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good house? Bigger than ours?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Luk\xc3\xa1shka good-naturedly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch bigger; ten times as big and three storeys high,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have you horses such as ours?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a hundred horses, worth three or four hundred rubles each, but\nthey are not like yours. They are trotters, you know.... But still, I\nlike the horses here best.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and did you come here of your own free will, or were you sent?\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Luk\xc3\xa1shka, laughing at him. \xe2\x80\x9cLook! that\xe2\x80\x99s where you lost your way,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe added, \xe2\x80\x9cyou should have turned to the right.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came by my own wish,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ol\xc3\xa9nin. \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to see your parts\nand to join some expeditions.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would go on an expedition any day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka. \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you hear the\njackals howling?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, listening.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, don\xe2\x80\x99t you feel any horror at having killed a man?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\nOl\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s there to be frightened about? But I should like to join an\nexpedition,\xe2\x80\x9d Luk\xc3\xa1shka repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cHow I want to! How I want to!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps we may be going together. Our company is going before the\nholidays, and your \xe2\x80\x98hundred\xe2\x80\x99 too.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did you want to come here for? You\xe2\x80\x99ve a house and horses and\nserfs. In your place I\xe2\x80\x99d do nothing but make merry! And what is your\nrank?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a cadet, but have been recommended for a commission.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you\xe2\x80\x99re not bragging about your home, if I were you I\xe2\x80\x99d never\nhave left it! Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99d never have gone away anywhere. Do you find it\npleasant living among us?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, very pleasant,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\nIt had grown quite dark before, talking in this way, they approached\nthe village. They were still surrounded by the deep gloom of the\nforest. The wind howled through the tree-tops. The jackals suddenly\nseemed to be crying close beside them, howling, chuckling, and sobbing;\nbut ahead of them in the village the sounds of women\xe2\x80\x99s voices and the\nbarking of dogs could already be heard; the outlines of the huts were\nclearly to be seen; lights gleamed and the air was filled with the\npeculiar smell of _kisyak_ smoke. Ol\xc3\xa9nin felt keenly, that night\nespecially, that here in this village was his home, his family, all his\nhappiness, and that he never had and never would live so happily\nanywhere as he did in this Cossack village. He was so fond of everybody\nand especially of Luk\xc3\xa1shka that night. On reaching home, to Luk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s\ngreat surprise, Ol\xc3\xa9nin with his own hands led out of the shed a horse\nhe had bought in Gr\xc3\xb3znoe\xe2\x80\x94it was not the one he usually rode but\nanother\xe2\x80\x94not a bad horse though no longer young, and gave it to\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should you give me a present?\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, \xe2\x80\x9cI have not yet done\nanything for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally it is nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ol\xc3\xa9nin. \xe2\x80\x9cTake it, and you will give me\na present, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll go on an expedition against the enemy together.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka became confused.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what d\xe2\x80\x99you mean by it? As if a horse were of little value,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid without looking at the horse.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it, take it! If you don\xe2\x80\x99t you will offend me. Vany\xc3\xbasha! Take the\ngrey horse to his house.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka took hold of the halter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, thank you! This is something unexpected, undreamt of.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin was as happy as a boy of twelve.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTie it up here. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good horse. I bought it in Gr\xc3\xb3znoe; it gallops\nsplendidly! Vany\xc3\xbasha, bring us some _chikhir_. Come into the hut.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe wine was brought. Luk\xc3\xa1shka sat down and took the wine-bowl.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod willing I\xe2\x80\x99ll find a way to repay you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, finishing his\nwine. \xe2\x80\x9cHow are you called?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDm\xc3\xadtri Andr\xc3\xa9ich.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, \xe2\x80\x99Mitry Andr\xc3\xa9ich, God bless you. We will be _kunaks_. Now you\nmust come to see us. Though we are not rich people still we can treat a\n_kunak_, and I will tell mother in case you need anything\xe2\x80\x94clotted cream\nor grapes\xe2\x80\x94and if you come to the cordon I\xe2\x80\x99m your servant to go hunting\nor to go across the river, anywhere you like! There now, only the other\nday, what a boar I killed, and I divided it among the Cossacks, but if\nI had only known, I\xe2\x80\x99d have given it to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right, thank you! But don\xe2\x80\x99t harness the horse, it has never\nbeen in harness.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy harness the horse? And there is something else I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you if\nyou like,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, bending his head. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a _kunak_, Gir\xc3\xa9y\nKhan. He asked me to lie in ambush by the road where they come down\nfrom the mountains. Shall we go together? I\xe2\x80\x99ll not betray you. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be\nyour _murid_.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we\xe2\x80\x99ll go; we\xe2\x80\x99ll go some day.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka seemed quite to have quieted down and to have understood\nOl\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s attitude towards him. His calmness and the ease of his\nbehaviour surprised Ol\xc3\xa9nin, and he did not even quite like it. They\ntalked long, and it was late when Luk\xc3\xa1shka, not tipsy (he never was\ntipsy) but having drunk a good deal, left Ol\xc3\xa9nin after shaking hands.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin looked out of the window to see what he would do. Luk\xc3\xa1shka went\nout, hanging his head. Then, having led the horse out of the gate, he\nsuddenly shook his head, threw the reins of the halter over its head,\nsprang onto its back like a cat, gave a wild shout, and galloped down\nthe street. Ol\xc3\xa9nin expected that Luk\xc3\xa1shka would go to share his joy\nwith Mary\xc3\xa1nka, but though he did not do so Ol\xc3\xa9nin still felt his soul\nmore at ease than ever before in his life. He was as delighted as a\nboy, and could not refrain from telling Vany\xc3\xbasha not only that he had\ngiven Luk\xc3\xa1shka the horse, but also why he had done it, as well as his\nnew theory of happiness.\n\nVany\xc3\xbasha did not approve of his theory, and announced that \xe2\x80\x9c_l\xe2\x80\x99argent\nil n\xe2\x80\x99y a pas!_\xe2\x80\x9d and that therefore it was all nonsense.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka rode home, jumped off the horse, and handed it over to his\nmother, telling her to let it out with the communal Cossack herd. He\nhimself had to return to the cordon that same night. His deaf sister\nundertook to take the horse, and explained by signs that when she saw\nthe man who had given the horse, she would bow down at his feet. The\nold woman only shook her head at her son\xe2\x80\x99s story, and decided in her\nown mind that he had stolen it. She therefore told the deaf girl to\ntake it to the herd before daybreak.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka went back alone to the cordon pondering over Ol\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s action.\nThough he did not consider the horse a good one, yet it was worth at\nleast forty rubles and Luk\xc3\xa1shka was very glad to have the present. But\nwhy it had been given him he could not at all understand, and therefore\nhe did not experience the least feeling of gratitude. On the contrary,\nvague suspicions that the cadet had some evil intentions filled his\nmind. What those intentions were he could not decide, but neither could\nhe admit the idea that a stranger would give him a horse worth forty\nrubles for nothing, just out of kindness; it seemed impossible. Had he\nbeen drunk one might understand it! He might have wished to show off.\nBut the cadet had been sober, and therefore must have wished to bribe\nhim to do something wrong. \xe2\x80\x9cEh, humbug!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Luk\xc3\xa1shka. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t I\ngot the horse and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see later on. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a fool myself and we\nshall see who\xe2\x80\x99ll get the better of the other,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, feeling the\nnecessity of being on his guard, and therefore arousing in himself\nunfriendly feelings towards Ol\xc3\xa9nin. He told no one how he had got the\nhorse. To some he said he had bought it, to others he replied\nevasively. However, the truth soon got about in the village, and\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s mother and Mary\xc3\xa1nka, as well as Elias Vas\xc3\xadlich and other\nCossacks, when they heard of Ol\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s unnecessary gift, were perplexed,\nand began to be on their guard against the cadet. But despite their\nfears his action aroused in them a great respect for his simplicity and\nwealth.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you heard,\xe2\x80\x9d said one, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the cadet quartered on Elias Vas\xc3\xadlich\nhas thrown a fifty-ruble horse at Luk\xc3\xa1shka? He\xe2\x80\x99s rich! ...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I heard of it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied another profoundly, \xe2\x80\x9che must have done\nhim some great service. We shall see what will come of this cadet. Eh!\nwhat luck that Snatcher has!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose cadets are crafty, awfully crafty,\xe2\x80\x9d said a third. \xe2\x80\x9cSee if he\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t go setting fire to a building, or doing something!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXIII\n\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s life went on with monotonous regularity. He had little\nintercourse with the commanding officers or with his equals. The\nposition of a rich cadet in the Caucasus was peculiarly advantageous in\nthis respect. He was not sent out to work, or for training. As a reward\nfor going on an expedition he was recommended for a commission, and\nmeanwhile he was left in peace. The officers regarded him as an\naristocrat and behaved towards him with dignity. Cardplaying and the\nofficers\xe2\x80\x99 carousals accompanied by the soldier-singers, of which he had\nhad experience when he was with the detachment, did not seem to him\nattractive, and he also avoided the society and life of the officers in\nthe village. The life of officers stationed in a Cossack village has\nlong had its own definite form. Just as every cadet or officer when in\na fort regularly drinks porter, plays cards, and discusses the rewards\ngiven for taking part in the expeditions, so in the Cossack villages he\nregularly drinks _chikhir_ with his hosts, treats the girls to\nsweet-meats and honey, dangles after the Cossack women, and falls in\nlove, and occasionally marries there. Ol\xc3\xa9nin always took his own path\nand had an unconscious objection to the beaten tracks. And here, too,\nhe did not follow the ruts of a Caucasian officer\xe2\x80\x99s life.\n\nIt came quite naturally to him to wake up at daybreak. After drinking\ntea and admiring from his porch the mountains, the morning, and\nMary\xc3\xa1nka, he would put on a tattered ox-hide coat, sandals of soaked\nraw hide, buckle on a dagger, take a gun, put cigarettes and some lunch\nin a little bag, call his dog, and soon after five o\xe2\x80\x99clock would start\nfor the forest beyond the village. Towards seven in the evening he\nwould return tired and hungry with five or six pheasants hanging from\nhis belt (sometimes with some other animal) and with his bag of food\nand cigarettes untouched. If the thoughts in his head had lain like the\nlunch and cigarettes in the bag, one might have seen that during all\nthose fourteen hours not a single thought had moved in it. He returned\nmorally fresh, strong, and perfectly happy, and he could not tell what\nhe had been thinking about all the time. Were they ideas, memories, or\ndreams that had been flitting through his mind? They were frequently\nall three. He would rouse himself and ask what he had been thinking\nabout; and would see himself as a Cossack working in a vineyard with\nhis Cossack wife, or an _abrek_ in the mountains, or a boar running\naway from himself. And all the time he kept peering and watching for a\npheasant, a boar, or a deer.\n\nIn the evening Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka would be sure to be sitting with him.\nVany\xc3\xbasha would bring a jug of _chikhir_, and they would converse\nquietly, drink, and separate to go quite contentedly to bed. The next\nday he would again go shooting, again be healthily weary, again they\nwould sit conversing and drink their fill, and again be happy.\nSometimes on a holiday or day of rest Ol\xc3\xa9nin spent the whole day at\nhome. Then his chief occupation was watching Mary\xc3\xa1nka, whose every\nmovement, without realizing it himself, he followed greedily from his\nwindow or his porch. He regarded Mary\xc3\xa1nka and loved her (so he thought)\njust as he loved the beauty of the mountains and the sky, and he had no\nthought of entering into any relations with her. It seemed to him that\nbetween him and her such relations as there were between her and the\nCossack Luk\xc3\xa1shka could not exist, and still less such as often existed\nbetween rich officers and other Cossack girls. It seemed to him that if\nhe tried to do as his fellow officers did, he would exchange his\ncomplete enjoyment of contemplation for an abyss of suffering,\ndisillusionment, and remorse. Besides, he had already achieved a\ntriumph of self-sacrifice in connexion with her which had given him\ngreat pleasure, and above all he was in a way afraid of Mary\xc3\xa1nka and\nwould not for anything have ventured to utter a word of love to her\nlightly.\n\nOnce during the summer, when Ol\xc3\xa9nin had not gone out shooting but was\nsitting at home, quite unexpectedly a Moscow acquaintance, a very young\nman whom he had met in society, came in.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, _mon cher_, my dear fellow, how glad I was when I heard that you\nwere here!\xe2\x80\x9d he began in his Moscow French, and he went on intermingling\nFrench words in his remarks. \xe2\x80\x9cThey said, \xe2\x80\x98Ol\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99. What Ol\xc3\xa9nin? and I\nwas so pleased.... Fancy fate bringing us together here! Well, and how\nare you? How? Why?\xe2\x80\x9d and Prince Bel\xc3\xa9tski told his whole story: how he\nhad temporarily entered the regiment, how the Commander-in-Chief had\noffered to take him as an adjutant, and how he would take up the post\nafter this campaign although personally he felt quite indifferent about\nit.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLiving here in this hole one must at least make a career\xe2\x80\x94get a\ncross\xe2\x80\x94or a rank\xe2\x80\x94be transferred to the Guards. That is quite\nindispensable, not for myself but for the sake of my relations and\nfriends. The prince received me very well; he is a very decent fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Bel\xc3\xa9tski, and went on unceasingly. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been recommended for\nthe St. Anna Cross for the expedition. Now I shall stay here a bit\nuntil we start on the campaign. It\xe2\x80\x99s capital here. What women! Well,\nand how are you getting on? I was told by our captain, St\xc3\xa1rtsev you\nknow, a kind-hearted stupid creature.... Well, he said you were living\nlike an awful savage, seeing no one! I quite understand you don\xe2\x80\x99t want\nto be mixed up with the set of officers we have here. I am so glad now\nyou and I will be able to see something of one another. I have put up\nat the Cossack corporal\xe2\x80\x99s house. There is such a girl there. \xc3\x9astenka! I\ntell you she\xe2\x80\x99s just charming.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd more and more French and Russian words came pouring forth from that\nworld which Ol\xc3\xa9nin thought he had left for ever. The general opinion\nabout Bel\xc3\xa9tski was that he was a nice, good-natured fellow. Perhaps he\nreally was; but in spite of his pretty, good-natured face, Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nthought him extremely unpleasant. He seemed just to exhale that\nfilthiness which Ol\xc3\xa9nin had forsworn. What vexed him most was that he\ncould not\xe2\x80\x94had not the strength\xe2\x80\x94abruptly to repulse this man who came\nfrom that world: as if that old world he used to belong to had an\nirresistible claim on him. Ol\xc3\xa9nin felt angry with Bel\xc3\xa9tski and with\nhimself, yet against his wish he introduced French phrases into his own\nconversation, was interested in the Commander-in-Chief and in their\nMoscow acquaintances, and because in this Cossack village he and\nBel\xc3\xa9tski both spoke French, he spoke contemptuously of their fellow\nofficers and of the Cossacks, and was friendly with Bel\xc3\xa9tski, promising\nto visit him and inviting him to drop in to see him. Ol\xc3\xa9nin however did\nnot himself go to see Bel\xc3\xa9tski. Vany\xc3\xbasha for his part approved of\nBel\xc3\xa9tski, remarking that he was a real gentleman.\n\nBel\xc3\xa9tski at once adopted the customary life of a rich officer in a\nCossack village. Before Ol\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, in one month he came to be like\nan old resident of the village; he made the old men drunk, arranged\nevening parties, and himself went to parties arranged by the\ngirls\xe2\x80\x94bragged of his conquests, and even got so far that, for some\nunknown reason, the women and girls began calling him grandad, and the\nCossacks, to whom a man who loved wine and women was clearly\nunderstandable, got used to him and even liked him better than they did\nOl\xc3\xa9nin, who was a puzzle to them.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXIV\n\n\nIt was five in the morning. Vany\xc3\xbasha was in the porch heating the\nsamovar, and using the leg of a long boot instead of bellows. Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nhad already ridden off to bathe in the T\xc3\xa9rek. (He had recently invented\na new amusement: to swim his horse in the river.) His landlady was in\nher outhouse, and the dense smoke of the kindling fire rose from the\nchimney. The girl was milking the buffalo cow in the shed. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t keep\nquiet, the damned thing!\xe2\x80\x9d came her impatient voice, followed by the\nrhythmical sound of milking.\n\nFrom the street in front of the house horses\xe2\x80\x99 hoofs were heard\nclattering briskly, and Ol\xc3\xa9nin, riding bareback on a handsome dark-grey\nhorse which was still wet and shining, rode up to the gate. Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s\nhandsome head, tied round with a red kerchief, appeared from the shed\nand again disappeared. Ol\xc3\xa9nin was wearing a red silk shirt, a white\nCircassian coat girdled with a strap which carried a dagger, and a tall\ncap. He sat his well-fed wet horse with a slightly conscious elegance\nand, holding his gun at his back, stooped to open the gate. His hair\nwas still wet, and his face shone with youth and health. He thought\nhimself handsome, agile, and like a brave; but he was mistaken. To any\nexperienced Caucasian he was still only a soldier. When he noticed that\nthe girl had put out her head he stooped with particular smartness,\nthrew open the gate and, tightening the reins, swished his whip and\nentered the yard. \xe2\x80\x9cIs tea ready, Vany\xc3\xbasha?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried gaily, not looking\nat the door of the shed. He felt with pleasure how his fine horse,\npressing down its flanks, pulling at the bridle and with every muscle\nquivering and with each foot ready to leap over the fence, pranced on\nthe hard clay of the yard. _\xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x99est pr\xc3\xaat_,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Vany\xc3\xbasha. Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nfelt as if Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful head was still looking out of the shed\nbut he did not turn to look at her. As he jumped down from his horse he\nmade an awkward movement and caught his gun against the porch, and\nturned a frightened look towards the shed, where there was no one to be\nseen and whence the sound of milking could still be heard.\n\nSoon after he had entered the hut he came out again and sat down with\nhis pipe and a book on the side of the porch which was not yet exposed\nto the rays of the sun. He meant not to go anywhere before dinner that\nday, and to write some long-postponed letters; but somehow he felt\ndisinclined to leave his place in the porch, and he was as reluctant to\ngo back into the hut as if it had been a prison. The housewife had\nheated her oven, and the girl, having driven the cattle, had come back\nand was collecting _kisyak_ and heaping it up along the fence. Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nwent on reading, but did not understand a word of what was written in\nthe book that lay open before him. He kept lifting his eyes from it and\nlooking at the powerful young woman who was moving about. Whether she\nstepped into the moist morning shadow thrown by the house, or went out\ninto the middle of the yard lit up by the joyous young light, so that\nthe whole of her stately figure in its bright coloured garment gleamed\nin the sunshine and cast a black shadow\xe2\x80\x94he always feared to lose any\none of her movements. It delighted him to see how freely and gracefully\nher figure bent: into what folds her only garment, a pink smock, draped\nitself on her bosom and along her shapely legs; how she drew herself up\nand her tight-drawn smock showed the outline of her heaving bosom, how\nthe soles of her narrow feet in her worn red slippers rested on the\nground without altering their shape; how her strong arms with the\nsleeves rolled up, exerting the muscles, used the spade almost as if in\nanger, and how her deep dark eyes sometimes glanced at him. Though the\ndelicate brows frowned, yet her eyes expressed pleasure and a knowledge\nof her own beauty.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Ol\xc3\xa9nin, have you been up long?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bel\xc3\xa9tski as he entered the\nyard dressed in the coat of a Caucasian officer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Bel\xc3\xa9tski,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ol\xc3\xa9nin, holding out his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cHow is it you\nare out so early?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had to. I was driven out; we are having a ball tonight. Mary\xc3\xa1nka, of\ncourse you\xe2\x80\x99ll come to \xc3\x9astenka\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, turning to the girl.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin felt surprised that Bel\xc3\xa9tski could address this woman so easily.\nBut Mary\xc3\xa1nka, as though she had not heard him, bent her head, and\nthrowing the spade across her shoulder went with her firm masculine\ntread towards the outhouse.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s shy, the wench is shy,\xe2\x80\x9d Bel\xc3\xa9tski called after her. \xe2\x80\x9cShy of you,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe added as, smiling gaily, he ran up the steps of the porch.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is it you are having a ball and have been driven out?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s at \xc3\x9astenka\xe2\x80\x99s, at my landlady\xe2\x80\x99s, that the ball is, and you two are\ninvited. A ball consists of a pie and a gathering of girls.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat should we do there?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBel\xc3\xa9tski smiled knowingly and winked, jerking his head in the direction\nof the outhouse into which Mary\xc3\xa1nka had disappeared.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin shrugged his shoulders and blushed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, really you are a strange fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome now, don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin frowned, and Bel\xc3\xa9tski noticing this smiled insinuatingly. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\ncome, what do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cliving in the same house\xe2\x80\x94and such a\nfine girl, a splendid girl, a perfect beauty\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWonderfully beautiful! I never saw such a woman before,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\nOl\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bel\xc3\xa9tski, quite unable to understand the situation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be strange,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ol\xc3\xa9nin, \xe2\x80\x9cbut why should I not say what is\ntrue? Since I have lived here women don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to exist for me. And it\nis so good, really! Now what can there be in common between us and\nwomen like these? Er\xc3\xb3shka\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s a different matter! He and I have a\npassion in common\xe2\x80\x94sport.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now! In common! And what have I in common with Am\xc3\xa1lia Iv\xc3\xa1novna?\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s the same thing! You may say they\xe2\x80\x99re not very clean\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s another\nmatter... _\xc3\x80 la guerre, comme \xc3\xa0 la guerre!_...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have never known any Am\xc3\xa1lia Iv\xc3\xa1novas, and have never known how\nto behave with women of that sort,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ol\xc3\xa9nin. \xe2\x80\x9cOne cannot respect\nthem, but these I do respect.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell go on respecting them! Who wants to prevent you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin did not reply. He evidently wanted to complete what he had begun\nto say. It was very near his heart.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know I am an exception...\xe2\x80\x9d He was visibly confused. \xe2\x80\x9cBut my life has\nso shaped itself that I not only see no necessity to renounce my rules,\nbut I could not live here, let alone live as happily as I am doing,\nwere I to live as you do. Therefore I look for something quite\ndifferent from what you look for.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBel\xc3\xa9tski raised his eyebrows incredulously. \xe2\x80\x9cAnyhow, come to me this\nevening; Mary\xc3\xa1nka will be there and I will make you acquainted. Do\ncome, please! If you feel dull you can go away. Will you come?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would come, but to speak frankly I am afraid of being seriously\ncarried away.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, oh, oh!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Bel\xc3\xa9tski. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly come, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll see that you\naren\xe2\x80\x99t. Will you? On your word?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would come, but really I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what we shall do; what\npart we shall play!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, I beg of you. You will come?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, perhaps I\xe2\x80\x99ll come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally now! Charming women such as one sees nowhere else, and to live\nlike a monk! What an idea! Why spoil your life and not make use of what\nis at hand? Have you heard that our company is ordered to\nVozdv\xc3\xadzhensk?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHardly. I was told the 8th Company would be sent there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I have had a letter from the adjutant there. He writes that the\nPrince himself will take part in the campaign. I am very glad I shall\nsee something of him. I\xe2\x80\x99m beginning to get tired of this place.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear we shall start on a raid soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not heard of it; but I have heard that Krinov\xc3\xadtsin has received\nthe Order of St. Anna for a raid. He expected a lieutenancy,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nBel\xc3\xa9tski laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was let in! He has set off for headquarters.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was growing dusk and Ol\xc3\xa9nin began thinking about the party. The\ninvitation he had received worried him. He felt inclined to go, but\nwhat might take place there seemed strange, absurd, and even rather\nalarming. He knew that neither Cossack men nor older women, nor anyone\nbesides the girls, were to be there. What was going to happen? How was\nhe to behave? What would they talk about? What connexion was there\nbetween him and those wild Cossack girls? Bel\xc3\xa9tski had told him of such\ncurious, cynical, and yet rigid relations. It seemed strange to think\nthat he would be there in the same hut with Mary\xc3\xa1nka and perhaps might\nhave to talk to her. It seemed to him impossible when he remembered her\nmajestic bearing. But Bel\xc3\xa9tski spoke of it as if it were all perfectly\nsimple. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible that Bel\xc3\xa9tski will treat Mary\xc3\xa1nka in the same\nway? That is interesting,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, better not go. It\xe2\x80\x99s all so\nhorrid, so vulgar, and above all\xe2\x80\x94it leads to nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d But again he was\nworried by the question of what would take place; and besides he felt\nas if bound by a promise. He went out without having made up his mind\none way or the other, but he walked as far as Bel\xc3\xa9tski\xe2\x80\x99s, and went in\nthere.\n\nThe hut in which Bel\xc3\xa9tski lived was like Ol\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s. It was raised nearly\nfive feet from the ground on wooden piles, and had two rooms. In the\nfirst (which Ol\xc3\xa9nin entered by the steep flight of steps) feather beds,\nrugs, blankets, and cushions were tastefully and handsomely arranged,\nCossack fashion, along the main wall. On the side wall hung brass\nbasins and weapons, while on the floor, under a bench, lay watermelons\nand pumpkins. In the second room there was a big brick oven, a table,\nand sectarian icons. It was here that Bel\xc3\xa9tski was quartered, with his\ncamp-bed and his pack and trunks. His weapons hung on the wall with a\nlittle rug behind them, and on the table were his toilet appliances and\nsome portraits. A silk dressing-gown had been thrown on the bench.\nBel\xc3\xa9tski himself, clean and good-looking, lay on the bed in his\nunderclothing, reading _Les Trois Mousquetaires_.\n\nHe jumped up.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, you see how I have arranged things. Fine! Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s good that\nyou have come. They are working furiously. Do you know what the pie is\nmade of? Dough with a stuffing of pork and grapes. But that\xe2\x80\x99s not the\npoint. You just look at the commotion out there!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd really, on looking out of the window they saw an unusual bustle\ngoing on in the hut. Girls ran in and out, now for one thing and now\nfor another.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill it soon be ready?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bel\xc3\xa9tski.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery soon! Why? Is Grandad hungry?\xe2\x80\x9d and from the hut came the sound of\nringing laughter.\n\n\xc3\x9astenka, plump, small, rosy, and pretty, with her sleeves turned up,\nran into Bel\xc3\xa9tski\xe2\x80\x99s hut to fetch some plates.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet away or I shall smash the plates!\xe2\x80\x9d she squeaked, escaping from\nBel\xc3\xa9tski. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better come and help,\xe2\x80\x9d she shouted to Ol\xc3\xa9nin,\nlaughing. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to get some refreshments for the girls.\xe2\x80\x9d\n(\xe2\x80\x9cRefreshments\xe2\x80\x9d meaning spicebread and sweets.)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd has Mary\xc3\xa1nka come?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course! She brought some dough.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bel\xc3\xa9tski, \xe2\x80\x9cif one were to dress \xc3\x9astenka up and\nclean and polish her up a bit, she\xe2\x80\x99d be better than all our beauties.\nHave you ever seen that Cossack woman who married a colonel; she was\ncharming! B\xc3\xb3rsheva? What dignity! Where do they get it...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not seen B\xc3\xb3rsheva, but I think nothing could be better than the\ncostume they wear here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I\xe2\x80\x99m first-rate at fitting into any kind of life,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bel\xc3\xa9tski\nwith a sigh of pleasure. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go and see what they are up to.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe threw his dressing-gown over his shoulders and ran out, shouting,\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you look after the \xe2\x80\x98refreshments\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin sent Bel\xc3\xa9tski\xe2\x80\x99s orderly to buy spice-bread and honey; but it\nsuddenly seemed to him so disgusting to give money (as if he were\nbribing someone) that he gave no definite reply to the orderly\xe2\x80\x99s\nquestion: \xe2\x80\x9cHow much spice-bread with peppermint, and how much with\nhoney?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I spend all the money,\xe2\x80\x9d asked the old soldier impressively. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\npeppermint is dearer. It\xe2\x80\x99s sixteen kopeks.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, spend it all,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ol\xc3\xa9nin and sat down by the window,\nsurprised that his heart was thumping as if he were preparing himself\nfor something serious and wicked.\n\nHe heard screaming and shrieking in the girls\xe2\x80\x99 hut when Bel\xc3\xa9tski went\nthere, and a few moments later saw how he jumped out and ran down the\nsteps, accompanied by shrieks, bustle, and laughter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurned out,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nA little later \xc3\x9astenka entered and solemnly invited her visitors to\ncome in: announcing that all was ready.\n\nWhen they came into the room they saw that everything was really ready.\n\xc3\x9astenka was rearranging the cushions along the wall. On the table,\nwhich was covered by a disproportionately small cloth, was a decanter\nof _chikhir_ and some dried fish. The room smelt of dough and grapes.\nSome half dozen girls in smart tunics, with their heads not covered as\nusual with kerchiefs, were huddled together in a corner behind the\noven, whispering, giggling, and spluttering with laughter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI humbly beg you to do honour to my patron saint,\xe2\x80\x9d said \xc3\x9astenka,\ninviting her guests to the table.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin noticed Mary\xc3\xa1nka among the group of girls, who without exception\nwere all handsome, and he felt vexed and hurt that he met her in such\nvulgar and awkward circumstances. He felt stupid and awkward, and made\nup his mind to do what Bel\xc3\xa9tski did. Bel\xc3\xa9tski stepped to the table\nsomewhat solemnly yet with confidence and ease, drank a glass of wine\nto \xc3\x9astenka\xe2\x80\x99s health, and invited the others to do the same. \xc3\x9astenka\nannounced that girls don\xe2\x80\x99t drink.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe might with a little honey,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed a voice from among the group\nof girls.\n\nThe orderly, who had just returned with the honey and spice-cakes, was\ncalled in. He looked askance (whether with envy or with contempt) at\nthe gentlemen, who in his opinion were on the spree; and carefully and\nconscientiously handed over to them a piece of honeycomb and the cakes\nwrapped up in a piece of greyish paper, and began explaining\ncircumstantially all about the price and the change, but Bel\xc3\xa9tski sent\nhim away.\n\nHaving mixed honey with wine in the glasses, and having lavishly\nscattered the three pounds of spice-cakes on the table, Bel\xc3\xa9tski\ndragged the girls from their corners by force, made them sit down at\nthe table, and began distributing the cakes among them. Ol\xc3\xa9nin\ninvoluntarily noticed how Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s sunburnt but small hand closed on\ntwo round peppermint nuts and one brown one, and that she did not know\nwhat to do with them. The conversation was halting and constrained, in\nspite of \xc3\x9astenka\xe2\x80\x99s and Bel\xc3\xa9tski\xe2\x80\x99s free and easy manner and their wish\nto enliven the company. Ol\xc3\xa9nin faltered, and tried to think of\nsomething to say, feeling that he was exciting curiosity and perhaps\nprovoking ridicule and infecting the others with his shyness. He\nblushed, and it seemed to him that Mary\xc3\xa1nka in particular was feeling\nuncomfortable. \xe2\x80\x9cMost likely they are expecting us to give them some\nmoney,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he. \xe2\x80\x9cHow are we to do it? And how can we manage\nquickest to give it and get away?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXV\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is it you don\xe2\x80\x99t know your own lodger?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bel\xc3\xa9tski, addressing\nMary\xc3\xa1nka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is one to know him if he never comes to see us?\xe2\x80\x9d answered\nMary\xc3\xa1nka, with a look at Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin felt frightened, he did not know of what. He flushed and, hardly\nknowing what he was saying, remarked: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid of your mother. She\ngave me such a scolding the first time I went in.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka burst out laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you were frightened?\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\nand glanced at him and turned away.\n\nIt was the first time Ol\xc3\xa9nin had seen the whole of her beautiful face.\nTill then he had seen her with her kerchief covering her to the eyes.\nIt was not for nothing that she was reckoned the beauty of the village.\n\xc3\x9astenka was a pretty girl, small, plump, rosy, with merry brown eyes,\nand red lips which were perpetually smiling and chattering. Mary\xc3\xa1nka on\nthe contrary was certainly not pretty but beautiful. Her features might\nhave been considered too masculine and almost harsh had it not been for\nher tall stately figure, her powerful chest and shoulders, and\nespecially the severe yet tender expression of her long dark eyes which\nwere darkly shadowed beneath their black brows, and for the gentle\nexpression of her mouth and smile. She rarely smiled, but her smile was\nalways striking. She seemed to radiate virginal strength and health.\nAll the girls were good-looking, but they themselves and Bel\xc3\xa9tski, and\nthe orderly when he brought in the spice-cakes, all involuntarily gazed\nat Mary\xc3\xa1nka, and anyone addressing the girls was sure to address her.\nShe seemed a proud and happy queen among them.\n\nBel\xc3\xa9tski, trying to keep up the spirit of the party, chattered\nincessantly, made the girls hand round _chikhir_, fooled about with\nthem, and kept making improper remarks in French about Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s\nbeauty to Ol\xc3\xa9nin, calling her \xe2\x80\x9cyours\xe2\x80\x9d (_la v\xc3\xb4tre_), and advising him to\nbehave as he did himself. Ol\xc3\xa9nin felt more and more uncomfortable. He\nwas devising an excuse to get out and run away when Bel\xc3\xa9tski announced\nthat \xc3\x9astenka, whose saint\xe2\x80\x99s day it was, must offer _chikhir_ to\neverybody with a kiss. She consented on condition that they should put\nmoney on her plate, as is the custom at weddings.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat fiend brought me to this disgusting feast?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Ol\xc3\xa9nin,\nrising to go away.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you off to?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll fetch some tobacco,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, meaning to escape, but Bel\xc3\xa9tski\nseized his hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have some money,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to him in French.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne can\xe2\x80\x99t go away, one has to pay here,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Ol\xc3\xa9nin bitterly,\nvexed at his own awkwardness. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t I really behave like Bel\xc3\xa9tski? I\nought not to have come, but once I am here I must not spoil their fun.\nI must drink like a Cossack,\xe2\x80\x9d and taking the wooden bowl (holding about\neight tumblers) he almost filled it with _chikhir_ and drank it almost\nall. The girls looked at him, surprised and almost frightened, as he\ndrank. It seemed to them strange and not right. \xc3\x9astenka brought them\nanother glass each, and kissed them both. \xe2\x80\x9cThere girls, now we\xe2\x80\x99ll have\nsome fun,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, clinking on the plate the four rubles the men had\nput there.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin no longer felt awkward, but became talkative.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Mary\xc3\xa1nka, it\xe2\x80\x99s your turn to offer us wine and a kiss,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nBel\xc3\xa9tski, seizing her hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you such a kiss!\xe2\x80\x9d she said playfully, preparing to\nstrike at him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne can kiss Grandad without payment,\xe2\x80\x9d said another girl.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a sensible girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bel\xc3\xa9tski, kissing the struggling girl.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you must offer it,\xe2\x80\x9d he insisted, addressing Mary\xc3\xa1nka. \xe2\x80\x9cOffer a\nglass to your lodger.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd taking her by the hand he led her to the bench and sat her down\nbeside Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a beauty,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning her head to see it in profile.\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka did not resist but proudly smiling turned her long eyes\ntowards Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA beautiful girl,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Bel\xc3\xa9tski.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, see what a beauty I am,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s look seemed to endorse.\nWithout considering what he was doing Ol\xc3\xa9nin embraced Mary\xc3\xa1nka and was\ngoing to kiss her, but she suddenly extricated herself, upsetting\nBel\xc3\xa9tski and pushing the top off the table, and sprang away towards the\noven. There was much shouting and laughter. Then Bel\xc3\xa9tski whispered\nsomething to the girls and suddenly they all ran out into the passage\nand locked the door behind them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you kiss Bel\xc3\xa9tski and won\xe2\x80\x99t kiss me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, just so. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to, that\xe2\x80\x99s all!\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, pouting and\nfrowning. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s Grandad,\xe2\x80\x9d she added with a smile. She went to the door\nand began to bang at it. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you locked the door, you devils?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let them be there and us here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin, drawing closer to\nher.\n\nShe frowned, and sternly pushed him away with her hand. And again she\nappeared so majestically handsome to Ol\xc3\xa9nin that he came to his senses\nand felt ashamed of what he was doing. He went to the door and began\npulling at it himself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBel\xc3\xa9tski! Open the door! What a stupid joke!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka again gave a bright happy laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, you\xe2\x80\x99re afraid of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you know you\xe2\x80\x99re as cross as your mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpend more of your time with Er\xc3\xb3shka; that will make the girls love\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d And she smiled, looking straight and close into his eyes.\n\nHe did not know what to reply. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if I were to come to see you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he\nlet fall.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be a different matter,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, tossing her head.\n\nAt that moment Bel\xc3\xa9tski pushed the door open, and Mary\xc3\xa1nka sprang away\nfrom Ol\xc3\xa9nin and in doing so her thigh struck his leg.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all nonsense what I have been thinking about\xe2\x80\x94love and\nself-sacrifice and Luk\xc3\xa1shka. Happiness is the one thing. He who is\nhappy is right,\xe2\x80\x9d flashed through Ol\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s mind, and with a strength\nunexpected to himself he seized and kissed the beautiful Mary\xc3\xa1nka on\nher temple and her cheek. Mary\xc3\xa1nka was not angry, but only burst into a\nloud laugh and ran out to the other girls.\n\nThat was the end of the party. \xc3\x9astenka\xe2\x80\x99s mother, returned from her\nwork, gave all the girls a scolding, and turned them all out.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXVI\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Ol\xc3\xa9nin, as he walked home. \xe2\x80\x9cI need only slacken the\nreins a bit and I might fall desperately in love with this Cossack\ngirl.\xe2\x80\x9d He went to bed with these thoughts, but expected it all to blow\nover and that he would continue to live as before.\n\nBut the old life did not return. His relations to Mary\xc3\xa1nka were\nchanged. The wall that had separated them was broken down. Ol\xc3\xa9nin now\ngreeted her every time they met.\n\nThe master of the house having returned to collect the rent, on hearing\nof Ol\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s wealth and generosity invited him to his hut. The old woman\nreceived him kindly, and from the day of the party onwards Ol\xc3\xa9nin often\nwent in of an evening and sat with them till late at night. He seemed\nto be living in the village just as he used to, but within him\neverything had changed. He spent his days in the forest, and towards\neight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when it began to grow dusk, he would go to see his\nhosts, alone or with Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka. They grew so used to him that they\nwere surprised when he stayed away. He paid well for his wine and was a\nquiet fellow. Vany\xc3\xbasha would bring him his tea and he would sit down in\na corner near the oven. The old woman did not mind him but went on with\nher work, and over their tea or their _chikhir_ they talked about\nCossack affairs, about the neighbours, or about Russia: Ol\xc3\xa9nin relating\nand the others inquiring. Sometimes he brought a book and read to\nhimself. Mary\xc3\xa1nka crouched like a wild goat with her feet drawn up\nunder her, sometimes on the top of the oven, sometimes in a dark\ncorner. She did not take part in the conversations, but Ol\xc3\xa9nin saw her\neyes and face and heard her moving or cracking sunflower seeds, and he\nfelt that she listened with her whole being when he spoke, and was\naware of his presence while he silently read to himself. Sometimes he\nthought her eyes were fixed on him, and meeting their radiance he\ninvoluntarily became silent and gazed at her. Then she would instantly\nhide her face and he would pretend to be deep in conversation with the\nold woman, while he listened all the time to her breathing and to her\nevery movement and waited for her to look at him again. In the presence\nof others she was generally bright and friendly with him, but when they\nwere alone together she was shy and rough. Sometimes he came in before\nMary\xc3\xa1nka had returned home. Suddenly he would hear her firm footsteps\nand catch a glimmer of her blue cotton smock at the open door. Then she\nwould step into the middle of the hut, catch sight of him, and her eyes\nwould give a scarcely perceptible kindly smile, and he would feel happy\nand frightened.\n\nHe neither sought for nor wished for anything from her, but every day\nher presence became more and more necessary to him.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin had entered into the life of the Cossack village so fully that\nhis past seemed quite foreign to him. As to the future, especially a\nfuture outside the world in which he was now living, it did not\ninterest him at all. When he received letters from home, from relatives\nand friends, he was offended by the evident distress with which they\nregarded him as a lost man, while he in his village considered those as\nlost who did not live as he was living. He felt sure he would never\nrepent of having broken away from his former surroundings and of having\nsettled down in this village to such a solitary and original life. When\nout on expeditions, and when quartered at one of the forts, he felt\nhappy too; but it was here, from under Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka\xe2\x80\x99s wing, from the\nforest and from his hut at the end of the village, and especially when\nhe thought of Mary\xc3\xa1nka and Luk\xc3\xa1shka, that he seemed to see the\nfalseness of his former life. That falseness used to rouse his\nindignation even before, but now it seemed inexpressibly vile and\nridiculous. Here he felt freer and freer every day and more and more of\na man. The Caucasus now appeared entirely different to what his\nimagination had painted it. He had found nothing at all like his\ndreams, nor like the descriptions of the Caucasus he had heard and\nread. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are none of all those chestnut steeds, precipices, Amalet\nBeks, heroes or villains,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he. \xe2\x80\x9cThe people live as nature\nlives: they die, are born, unite, and more are born\xe2\x80\x94they fight, eat and\ndrink, rejoice and die, without any restrictions but those that nature\nimposes on sun and grass, on animal and tree. They have no other laws.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTherefore these people, compared to himself, appeared to him beautiful,\nstrong, and free, and the sight of them made him feel ashamed and sorry\nfor himself. Often it seriously occurred to him to throw up everything,\nto get registered as a Cossack, to buy a hut and cattle and marry a\nCossack woman (only not Mary\xc3\xa1nka, whom he conceded to Luk\xc3\xa1shka), and to\nlive with Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka and go shooting and fishing with him, and go\nwith the Cossacks on their expeditions. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy ever don\xe2\x80\x99t I do it? What\nam I waiting for?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked himself, and he egged himself on and shamed\nhimself. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I afraid of doing what I hold to be reasonable and right?\nIs the wish to be a simple Cossack, to live close to nature, not to\ninjure anyone but even to do good to others, more stupid than my former\ndreams, such as those of becoming a minister of state or a colonel?\xe2\x80\x9d\nbut a voice seemed to say that he should wait, and not take any\ndecision. He was held back by a dim consciousness that he could not\nlive altogether like Er\xc3\xb3shka and Luk\xc3\xa1shka because he had a different\nidea of happiness\xe2\x80\x94he was held back by the thought that happiness lies\nin self-sacrifice. What he had done for Luk\xc3\xa1shka continued to give him\njoy. He kept looking for occasions to sacrifice himself for others, but\ndid not meet with them. Sometimes he forgot this newly discovered\nrecipe for happiness and considered himself capable of identifying his\nlife with Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka\xe2\x80\x99s, but then he quickly bethought himself and\npromptly clutched at the idea of conscious self-sacrifice, and from\nthat basis looked calmly and proudly at all men and at their happiness.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXVII\n\n\nJust before the vintage Luk\xc3\xa1shka came on horseback to see Ol\xc3\xa9nin. He\nlooked more dashing than ever.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell? Are you getting married?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin, greeting him merrily.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka gave no direct reply.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, I\xe2\x80\x99ve exchanged your horse across the river. This _is_ a horse!\nA Kabard\xc3\xa1 horse from the Lov stud. I know horses.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey examined the new horse and made him caracole about the yard. The\nhorse really was an exceptionally fine one, a broad and long gelding,\nwith glossy coat, thick silky tail, and the soft fine mane and crest of\na thoroughbred. He was so well fed that \xe2\x80\x9cyou might go to sleep on his\nback\xe2\x80\x9d as Luk\xc3\xa1shka expressed it. His hoofs, eyes, teeth, were\nexquisitely shaped and sharply outlined, as one only finds them in very\npure-bred horses. Ol\xc3\xa9nin could not help admiring the horse, he had not\nyet met with such a beauty in the Caucasus.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how it goes!\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, patting its neck. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a step! And\nso clever\xe2\x80\x94he simply runs after his master.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you have to add much to make the exchange?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not count it,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Luk\xc3\xa1shka with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI got him from a\n_kunak_.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA wonderfully beautiful horse! What would you take for it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\nOl\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been offered a hundred and fifty rubles for it, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll give\nit you for nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, merrily. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly say the word and\nit\xe2\x80\x99s yours. I\xe2\x80\x99ll unsaddle it and you may take it. Only give me some\nsort of a horse for my duties.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, on no account.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, here is a dagger I\xe2\x80\x99ve brought you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka,\nunfastening his girdle and taking out one of the two daggers which hung\nfrom it. \xe2\x80\x9cI got it from across the river.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, thank you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd mother has promised to bring you some grapes herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s quite unnecessary. We\xe2\x80\x99ll balance up some day. You see I don\xe2\x80\x99t\noffer you any money for the dagger!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could you? We are _kunaks_. It\xe2\x80\x99s just the same as when Gir\xc3\xa9y Khan\nacross the river took me into his home and said, \xe2\x80\x98Choose what you\nlike!\xe2\x80\x99 So I took this sword. It\xe2\x80\x99s our custom.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey went into the hut and had a drink.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you staying here awhile?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have come to say good-bye. They are sending me from the cordon\nto a company beyond the T\xc3\xa9rek. I am going tonight with my comrade\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when is the wedding to be?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be coming back for the betrothal, and then I shall return to\nthe company again,\xe2\x80\x9d Luk\xc3\xa1shka replied reluctantly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, and see nothing of your betrothed?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so\xe2\x80\x94what is the good of looking at her? When you go on campaign\nask in our company for Luk\xc3\xa1shka the Broad. But what a lot of boars\nthere are in our parts! I\xe2\x80\x99ve killed two. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-bye! Christ save you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka mounted his horse, and without calling on Mary\xc3\xa1nka, rode\ncaracoling down the street, where Naz\xc3\xa1rka was already awaiting him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, shan\xe2\x80\x99t we call round?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Naz\xc3\xa1rka, winking in the direction\nof Y\xc3\xa1mka\xe2\x80\x99s house.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a good one!\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka. \xe2\x80\x9cHere, take my horse to her and if\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t come soon give him some hay. I shall reach the company by the\nmorning anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHasn\xe2\x80\x99t the cadet given you anything more?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am thankful to have paid him back with a dagger\xe2\x80\x94he was going to ask\nfor the horse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, dismounting and handing over the horse\nto Naz\xc3\xa1rka.\n\nHe darted into the yard past Ol\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s very window, and came up to the\nwindow of the cornet\xe2\x80\x99s hut. It was already quite dark. Mary\xc3\xa1nka,\nwearing only her smock, was combing her hair preparing for bed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the Cossack.\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s look was severely indifferent, but her face suddenly\nbrightened up when she heard her name. She opened the window and leant\nout, frightened and joyous.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94what do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen!\xe2\x80\x9d uttered Luk\xc3\xa1shka. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me in for a minute. I am so sick of\nwaiting! It\xe2\x80\x99s awful!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe took hold of her head through the window and kissed her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, do open!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you talk nonsense? I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you I won\xe2\x80\x99t! Have you come for\nlong?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe did not answer but went on kissing her, and she did not ask again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, through the window one can\xe2\x80\x99t even hug you properly,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary\xc3\xa1nka dear!\xe2\x80\x9d came the voice of her mother, \xe2\x80\x9cwho is that with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka took off his cap, which might have been seen, and crouched\ndown by the window.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, be quick!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Mary\xc3\xa1nka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLuk\xc3\xa1shka called round,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered; \xe2\x80\x9che was asking for Daddy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then send him here!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s gone; said he was in a hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn fact, Luk\xc3\xa1shka, stooping, as with big strides he passed under the\nwindows, ran out through the yard and towards Y\xc3\xa1mka\xe2\x80\x99s house unseen by\nanyone but Ol\xc3\xa9nin. After drinking two bowls of _chikhir_ he and Naz\xc3\xa1rka\nrode away to the outpost. The night was warm, dark, and calm. They rode\nin silence, only the footfall of their horses was heard. Luk\xc3\xa1shka\nstarted a song about the Cossack, Ming\xc3\xa1l, but stopped before he had\nfinished the first verse, and after a pause, turning to Naz\xc3\xa1rka, said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let me in!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh?\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Naz\xc3\xa1rka. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. D\xe2\x80\x99you know what Y\xc3\xa1mka\ntold me? The cadet has begun going to their house. Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka brags\nthat he got a gun from the cadet for getting him Mary\xc3\xa1nka.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe lies, the old devil!\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s not such a\ngirl. If he does not look out I\xe2\x80\x99ll wallop that old devil\xe2\x80\x99s sides,\xe2\x80\x9d and\nhe began his favourite song:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the village of Izm\xc3\xa1ylov,\nFrom the master\xe2\x80\x99s favourite garden,\nOnce escaped a keen-eyed falcon.\nSoon after him a huntsman came a-riding,\nAnd he beckoned to the falcon that had strayed,\nBut the bright-eyed bird thus answered:\n\xe2\x80\x98In gold cage you could not keep me,\nOn your hand you could not hold me,\nSo now I fly to blue seas far away.\nThere a white swan I will kill,\nOf sweet swan-flesh have my fill.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXVIII\n\n\nThe betrothal was taking place in the cornet\xe2\x80\x99s hut. Luk\xc3\xa1shka had\nreturned to the village, but had not been to see Ol\xc3\xa9nin, and Ol\xc3\xa9nin had\nnot gone to the betrothal though he had been invited. He was sad as he\nhad never been since he settled in this Cossack village. He had seen\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka earlier in the evening and was worried by the question why\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka was so cold towards him. Ol\xc3\xa9nin shut himself up in his hut and\nbegan writing in his diary as follows:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMany things have I pondered over lately and much have I changed,\xe2\x80\x9d\nwrote he, \xe2\x80\x9cand I have come back to the copybook maxim: The one way to\nbe happy is to love, to love self-denyingly, to love everybody and\neverything; to spread a web of love on all sides and to take all who\ncome into it. In this way I caught Vany\xc3\xbasha, Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka, Luk\xc3\xa1shka,\nand Mary\xc3\xa1nka.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs Ol\xc3\xa9nin was finishing this sentence Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka entered the room.\n\nEr\xc3\xb3shka was in the happiest frame of mind. A few evenings before this,\nOl\xc3\xa9nin had gone to see him and had found him with a proud and happy\nface deftly skinning the carcass of a boar with a small knife in the\nyard. The dogs (Lyam his pet among them) were lying close by watching\nwhat he was doing and gently wagging their tails. The little boys were\nrespectfully looking at him through the fence and not even teasing him\nas was their wont. His women neighbours, who were as a rule not too\ngracious towards him, greeted him and brought him, one a jug of\n_chikhir_, another some clotted cream, and a third a little flour. The\nnext day Er\xc3\xb3shka sat in his store-room all covered with blood, and\ndistributed pounds of boar-flesh, taking in payment money from some and\nwine from others. His face clearly expressed, \xe2\x80\x9cGod has sent me luck. I\nhave killed a boar, so now I am wanted.\xe2\x80\x9d Consequently, he naturally\nbegan to drink, and had gone on for four days never leaving the\nvillage. Besides which he had had something to drink at the betrothal.\n\nHe came to Ol\xc3\xa9nin quite drunk: his face red, his beard tangled, but\nwearing a new _beshmet_ trimmed with gold braid; and he brought with\nhim a _balal\xc3\xa1yka_ which he had obtained beyond the river. He had long\npromised Ol\xc3\xa9nin this treat, and felt in the mood for it, so that he was\nsorry to find Ol\xc3\xa9nin writing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWrite on, write on, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, as if he thought that a\nspirit sat between him and the paper and must not be frightened away,\nand he softly and silently sat down on the floor. When Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka\nwas drunk his favourite position was on the floor. Ol\xc3\xa9nin looked round,\nordered some wine to be brought, and continued to write. Er\xc3\xb3shka found\nit dull to drink by himself and he wished to talk.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been to the betrothal at the cornet\xe2\x80\x99s. But there! They\xe2\x80\x99re\nshwine!\xe2\x80\x94Don\xe2\x80\x99t want them!\xe2\x80\x94Have come to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where did you get your _balal\xc3\xa1yka?_\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin, still writing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been beyond the river and got it there, brother mine,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nanswered, also very quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a master at it. Tartar or Cossack,\nsquire or soldiers\xe2\x80\x99 songs, any kind you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin looked at him again, smiled, and went on writing.\n\nThat smile emboldened the old man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, leave off, my lad, leave off!\xe2\x80\x9d he said with sudden firmness.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, perhaps I will.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, people have injured you but leave them alone, spit at them!\nCome, what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of writing and writing, what\xe2\x80\x99s the good?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd he tried to mimic Ol\xc3\xa9nin by tapping the floor with his thick\nfingers, and then twisted his big face to express contempt.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good of writing quibbles. Better have a spree and show\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re a man!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNo other conception of writing found place in his head except that of\nlegal chicanery.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin burst out laughing and so did Er\xc3\xb3shka. Then, jumping up from the\nfloor, the latter began to show off his skill on the _balal\xc3\xa1yka_ and to\nsing Tartar songs.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy write, my good fellow! You\xe2\x80\x99d better listen to what I\xe2\x80\x99ll sing to\nyou. When you\xe2\x80\x99re dead you won\xe2\x80\x99t hear any more songs. Make merry now!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFirst he sang a song of his own composing accompanied by a dance:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dim,\nSay where did they last see him?\nIn a booth, at the fair,\nHe was selling pins, there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nThen he sang a song he had learnt from his former sergeant-major:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeep I fell in love on Monday,\nTuesday nothing did but sigh,\nWednesday I popped the question,\nThursday waited her reply.\nFriday, late, it came at last,\nThen all hope for me was past!\nSaturday my life to take\nI determined like a man,\nBut for my salvation\xe2\x80\x99s sake\nSunday morning changed my plan!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nThen he sang again:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dim,\nSay where did they last see him?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nAnd after that, winking, twitching his shoulders, and footing it to the\ntune, he sang:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will kiss you and embrace,\nRibbons red twine round you;\nAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ll call you little Grace.\nOh, you little Grace now do\nTell me, do you love me true?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nAnd he became so excited that with a sudden dashing movement he started\ndancing around the room accompanying himself the while.\n\nSongs like \xe2\x80\x9cDee, dee, dee\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cgentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s songs\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he sang for Ol\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s\nbenefit, but after drinking three more tumblers of _chikhir_ he\nremembered old times and began singing real Cossack and Tartar songs.\nIn the midst of one of his favourite songs his voice suddenly trembled\nand he ceased singing, and only continued strumming on the _balal\xc3\xa1yka_.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear friend!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nThe peculiar sound of his voice made Ol\xc3\xa9nin look round.\n\nThe old man was weeping. Tears stood in his eyes and one tear was\nrunning down his cheek.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are gone, my young days, and will never come back!\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\nblubbering and halting. \xe2\x80\x9cDrink, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you drink!\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly\nshouted with a deafening roar, without wiping away his tears.\n\nThere was one Tartar song that specially moved him. It had few words,\nbut its charm lay in the sad refrain. \xe2\x80\x9cAy day, dalalay!\xe2\x80\x9d Er\xc3\xb3shka\ntranslated the words of the song: \xe2\x80\x9cA youth drove his sheep from the\n_aoul_ to the mountains: the Russians came and burnt the _aoul_, they\nkilled all the men and took all the women into bondage. The youth\nreturned from the mountains. Where the _aoul_ had stood was an empty\nspace; his mother not there, nor his brothers, nor his house; one tree\nalone was left standing. The youth sat beneath the tree and wept.\n\xe2\x80\x98Alone like thee, alone am I left,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d and Er\xc3\xb3shka began singing: \xe2\x80\x9cAy\nday, dalalay!\xe2\x80\x9d and the old man repeated several times this wailing,\nheart-rending refrain.\n\nWhen he had finished the refrain Er\xc3\xb3shka suddenly seized a gun that\nhung on the wall, rushed hurriedly out into the yard and fired off both\nbarrels into the air. Then again he began, more dolefully, his \xe2\x80\x9cAy day,\ndalalay\xe2\x80\x94ah, ah,\xe2\x80\x9d and ceased.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin followed him into the porch and looked up into the starry sky in\nthe direction where the shots had flashed. In the cornet\xe2\x80\x99s house there\nwere lights and the sound of voices. In the yard girls were crowding\nround the porch and the windows, and running backwards and forwards\nbetween the hut and the outhouse. Some Cossacks rushed out of the hut\nand could not refrain from shouting, re-echoing the refrain of Daddy\nEr\xc3\xb3shka\xe2\x80\x99s song and his shots.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you not at the betrothal?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind them! Never mind them!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the old man, who had\nevidently been offended by something there. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t like them, I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nOh, those people! Come back into the hut! Let them make merry by\nthemselves and we\xe2\x80\x99ll make merry by ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin went in.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Luk\xc3\xa1shka, is he happy? Won\xe2\x80\x99t he come to see me?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Luk\xc3\xa1shka? They\xe2\x80\x99ve lied to him and said I am getting his girl for\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what\xe2\x80\x99s the girl? She will be ours if\nwe want her. Give enough money\xe2\x80\x94and she\xe2\x80\x99s ours. I\xe2\x80\x99ll fix it up for you.\nReally!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Daddy, money can do nothing if she does not love me. You\xe2\x80\x99d better\nnot talk like that!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are not loved, you and I. We are forlorn,\xe2\x80\x9d said Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka\nsuddenly, and again he began to cry.\n\nListening to the old man\xe2\x80\x99s talk Ol\xc3\xa9nin had drunk more than usual. \xe2\x80\x9cSo\nnow my Luk\xc3\xa1shka is happy,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he; yet he felt sad. The old man had\ndrunk so much that evening that he fell down on the floor and Vany\xc3\xbasha\nhad to call soldiers in to help, and spat as they dragged the old man\nout. He was so angry with the old man for his bad behaviour that he did\nnot even say a single French word.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXIX\n\n\nIt was August. For days the sky had been cloudless, the sun scorched\nunbearably and from early morning the warm wind raised a whirl of hot\nsand from the sand-drifts and from the road, and bore it in the air\nthrough the reeds, the trees, and the village. The grass and the leaves\non the trees were covered with dust, the roads and dried-up salt\nmarshes were baked so hard that they rang when trodden on. The water\nhad long since subsided in the T\xc3\xa9rek and rapidly vanished and dried up\nin the ditches. The slimy banks of the pond near the village were\ntrodden bare by the cattle and all day long you could hear the\nsplashing of water and the shouting of girls and boys bathing. The\nsand-drifts and the reeds were already drying up in the steppes, and\nthe cattle, lowing, ran into the fields in the day-time. The boars\nmigrated into the distant reed-beds and to the hills beyond the T\xc3\xa9rek.\nMosquitoes and gnats swarmed in thick clouds over the low lands and\nvillages. The snow-peaks were hidden in grey mist. The air was rarefied\nand smoky. It was said that _abreks_ had crossed the now shallow river\nand were prowling on this side of it. Every night the sun set in a\nglowing red blaze. It was the busiest time of the year. The villagers\nall swarmed in the melon-fields and the vineyards. The vineyards\nthickly overgrown with twining verdure lay in cool, deep shade.\nEverywhere between the broad translucent leaves, ripe, heavy, black\nclusters peeped out. Along the dusty road from the vineyards the\ncreaking carts moved slowly, heaped up with black grapes. Clusters of\nthem, crushed by the wheels, lay in the dirt. Boys and girls in smocks\nstained with grape-juice, with grapes in their hands and mouths, ran\nafter their mothers. On the road you continually came across tattered\nlabourers with baskets of grapes on their powerful shoulders; Cossack\nmaidens, veiled with kerchiefs to their eyes, drove bullocks harnessed\nto carts laden high with grapes. Soldiers who happened to meet these\ncarts asked for grapes, and the maidens, clambering up without stopping\ntheir carts, would take an armful of grapes and drop them into the\nskirts of the soldiers\xe2\x80\x99 coats. In some homesteads they had already\nbegun pressing the grapes; and the smell of the emptied skins filled\nthe air. One saw the blood-red troughs in the pent-houses in the yards\nand Nog\xc3\xa1y labourers with their trousers rolled up and their legs\nstained with the juice. Grunting pigs gorged themselves with the empty\nskins and rolled about in them. The flat roofs of the outhouses were\nall spread over with the dark amber clusters drying in the sun. Daws\nand magpies crowded round the roofs, picking the seeds and fluttering\nfrom one place to another.\n\nThe fruits of the year\xe2\x80\x99s labour were being merrily gathered in, and\nthis year the fruit was unusually fine and plentiful.\n\nIn the shady green vineyards amid a sea of vines, laughter, songs,\nmerriment, and the voices of women were to be heard on all sides, and\nglimpses of their bright-coloured garments could be seen.\n\nJust at noon Mary\xc3\xa1nka was sitting in their vineyard in the shade of a\npeach-tree, getting out the family dinner from under an unharnessed\ncart. Opposite her, on a spread-out horse-cloth, sat the cornet (who\nhad returned from the school) washing his hands by pouring water on\nthem from a little jug. Her little brother, who had just come straight\nout of the pond, stood wiping his face with his wide sleeves, and gazed\nanxiously at his sister and his mother and breathed deeply, awaiting\nhis dinner. The old mother, with her sleeves rolled up over her strong\nsunburnt arms, was arranging grapes, dried fish, and clotted cream on a\nlittle low, circular Tartar table. The cornet wiped his hands, took off\nhis cap, crossed himself, and moved nearer to the table. The boy seized\nthe jug and eagerly began to drink. The mother and daughter crossed\ntheir legs under them and sat down by the table. Even in the shade it\nwas intolerably hot. The air above the vineyard smelt unpleasant: the\nstrong warm wind passing amid the branches brought no coolness, but\nonly monotonously bent the tops of the pear, peach, and mulberry trees\nwith which the vineyard was sprinkled. The cornet, having crossed\nhimself once more, took a little jug of _chikhir_ that stood behind him\ncovered with a vine-leaf, and having had a drink from the mouth of the\njug passed it to the old woman. He had nothing on over his shirt, which\nwas unfastened at the neck and showed his shaggy muscular chest. His\nfine-featured cunning face looked cheerful; neither in his attitude nor\nin his words was his usual wiliness to be seen; he was cheerful and\nnatural.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we finish the bit beyond the shed tonight?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, wiping his\nwet beard.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll manage it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied his wife, \xe2\x80\x9cif only the weather does not\nhinder us. The D\xc3\xabmkins have not half finished yet,\xe2\x80\x9d she added. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly\n\xc3\x9astenka is at work there, wearing herself out.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you expect of them?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man proudly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, have a drink, Mary\xc3\xa1nka dear!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, passing the\njug to the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cGod willing we\xe2\x80\x99ll have enough to pay for the wedding\nfeast,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not yet awhile,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cornet with a slight frown.\n\nThe girl hung her head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we mention it?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman. \xe2\x80\x9cThe affair is\nsettled, and the time is drawing near too.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t make plans beforehand,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cornet. \xe2\x80\x9cNow we have the\nharvest to get in.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen Luk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s new horse?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the old woman. \xe2\x80\x9cThat which\nDm\xc3\xadtri Andr\xc3\xa9ich Ol\xc3\xa9nin gave him is gone \xe2\x80\x94 he\xe2\x80\x99s exchanged it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have not; but I spoke with the servant today,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cornet,\n\xe2\x80\x9cand he said his master has again received a thousand rubles.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRolling in riches, in short,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman.\n\nThe whole family felt cheerful and contented.\n\nThe work was progressing successfully. The grapes were more abundant\nand finer than they had expected. After dinner Mary\xc3\xa1nka threw some\ngrass to the oxen, folded her _beshmet_ for a pillow, and lay down\nunder the wagon on the juicy down-trodden grass. She had on only a red\nkerchief over her head and a faded blue print smock, yet she felt\nunbearably hot. Her face was burning, and she did not know where to put\nher feet, her eyes were moist with sleepiness and weariness, her lips\nparted involuntarily, and her chest heaved heavily and deeply.\n\nThe busy time of year had begun a fortnight ago and the continuous\nheavy labour had filled the girl\xe2\x80\x99s life. At dawn she jumped up, washed\nher face with cold water, wrapped herself in a shawl, and ran out\nbarefoot to see to the cattle. Then she hurriedly put on her shoes and\nher _beshmet_ and, taking a small bundle of bread, she harnessed the\nbullocks and drove away to the vineyards for the whole day. There she\ncut the grapes and carried the baskets with only an hour\xe2\x80\x99s interval for\nrest, and in the evening she returned to the village, bright and not\ntired, dragging the bullocks by a rope or driving them with a long\nstick. After attending to the cattle, she took some sunflower seeds in\nthe wide sleeve of her smock and went to the corner of the street to\ncrack them and have some fun with the other girls. But as soon as it\nwas dusk she returned home, and after having supper with her parents\nand her brother in the dark outhouse, she went into the hut, healthy\nand free from care, and climbed onto the oven, where half drowsing she\nlistened to their lodger\xe2\x80\x99s conversation. As soon as he went away she\nwould throw herself down on her bed and sleep soundly and quietly till\nmorning. And so it went on day after day. She had not seen Luk\xc3\xa1shka\nsince the day of their betrothal, but calmly awaited the wedding. She\nhad got used to their lodger and felt his intent looks with pleasure.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXX\n\n\nAlthough there was no escape from the heat and the mosquitoes swarmed\nin the cool shadow of the wagons, and her little brother tossing about\nbeside her kept pushing her, Mary\xc3\xa1nka having drawn her kerchief over\nher head was just falling asleep, when suddenly their neighbour \xc3\x9astenka\ncame running towards her and, diving under the wagon, lay down beside\nher.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSleep, girls, sleep!\xe2\x80\x9d said \xc3\x9astenka, making herself comfortable under\nthe wagon. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cthis won\xe2\x80\x99t do!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe jumped up, plucked some green branches, and stuck them through the\nwheels on both sides of the wagon and hung her _beshmet_ over them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me in,\xe2\x80\x9d she shouted to the little boy as she again crept under the\nwagon. \xe2\x80\x9cIs this the place for a Cossack\xe2\x80\x94with the girls? Go away!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen alone under the wagon with her friend, \xc3\x9astenka suddenly put both\nher arms round her, and clinging close to her began kissing her cheeks\nand neck.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDarling, sweetheart,\xe2\x80\x9d she kept repeating, between bursts of shrill,\nclear laughter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you\xe2\x80\x99ve learnt it from Grandad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary\xc3\xa1nka, struggling. \xe2\x80\x9cStop\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd they both broke into such peals of laughter that Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s mother\nshouted to them to be quiet.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you jealous?\xe2\x80\x9d asked \xc3\x9astenka in a whisper.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat humbug! Let me sleep. What have you come for?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut \xc3\x9astenka kept on, \xe2\x80\x9cI say! But I wanted to tell you such a thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka raised herself on her elbow and arranged the kerchief which\nhad slipped off.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know something about your lodger!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary\xc3\xa1nka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you rogue of a girl!\xe2\x80\x9d said \xc3\x9astenka, nudging her with her elbow and\nlaughing. \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t tell anything. Does he come to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe does. What of that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary\xc3\xa1nka with a sudden blush.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I\xe2\x80\x99m a simple lass. I tell everybody. Why should I pretend?\xe2\x80\x9d said\n\xc3\x9astenka, and her bright rosy face suddenly became pensive. \xe2\x80\x9cWhom do I\nhurt? I love him, that\xe2\x80\x99s all about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrandad, do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the sin?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Mary\xc3\xa1nka! When is one to have a good time if not while one\xe2\x80\x99s still\nfree? When I marry a Cossack I shall bear children and shall have\ncares. There now, when you get married to Luk\xc3\xa1shka not even a thought\nof joy will enter your head: children will come, and work!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell? Some who are married live happily. It makes no difference!\xe2\x80\x9d\nMary\xc3\xa1nka replied quietly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo tell me just this once what has passed between you and Luk\xc3\xa1shka?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has passed? A match was proposed. Father put it off for a year,\nbut now it\xe2\x80\x99s been settled and they\xe2\x80\x99ll marry us in autumn.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what did he say to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka smiled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat should he say? He said he loved me. He kept asking me to come to\nthe vineyards with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust see what pitch! But you didn\xe2\x80\x99t go, did you? And what a dare-devil\nhe has become: the first among the braves. He makes merry out there in\nthe army too! The other day our K\xc3\xadrka came home; he says: \xe2\x80\x98What a horse\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s got in exchange!\xe2\x80\x99 But all the same I expect he frets after\nyou. And what else did he say?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust you know everything?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary\xc3\xa1nka laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cOne night he came\nto my window tipsy, and asked me to let him in.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you didn\xe2\x80\x99t let him?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him, indeed! Once I have said a thing I keep to it firm as a\nrock,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mary\xc3\xa1nka seriously.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fine fellow! If he wanted her, no girl would refuse him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let him go to the others,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mary\xc3\xa1nka proudly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t pity him?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do pity him, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll have no nonsense. It is wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xc3\x9astenka suddenly dropped her head on her friend\xe2\x80\x99s breast, seized hold\nof her, and shook with smothered laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cYou silly fool!\xe2\x80\x9d she\nexclaimed, quite out of breath. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be happy,\xe2\x80\x9d and she\nbegan tickling Mary\xc3\xa1nka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, leave off!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary\xc3\xa1nka, screaming and laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve crushed\nLaz\xc3\xbatka.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHark at those young devils! Quite frisky! Not tired yet!\xe2\x80\x9d came the old\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s sleepy voice from the wagon.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t want happiness,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated \xc3\x9astenka in a whisper, insistently.\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are lucky, that you are! How they love you! You are so crusty,\nand yet they love you. Ah, if I were in your place I\xe2\x80\x99d soon turn the\nlodger\xe2\x80\x99s head! I noticed him when you were at our house. He was ready\nto eat you with his eyes. What things Grandad has given me! And yours\nthey say is the richest of the Russians. His orderly says they have\nserfs of their own.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka raised herself, and after thinking a moment, smiled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what he once told me: the lodger I mean?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, biting\na bit of grass. \xe2\x80\x9cHe said, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99d like to be Luk\xc3\xa1shka the Cossack, or your\nbrother Laz\xc3\xbatka\xe2\x80\x94.\xe2\x80\x99 What do you think he meant?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, just chattering what came into his head,\xe2\x80\x9d answered \xc3\x9astenka. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\ndoes mine not say! Just as if he was possessed!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka dropped her hand on her folded _beshmet_, threw her arm over\n\xc3\x9astenka\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, and shut her eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wanted to come and work in the vineyard today: father invited him,\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe said, and after a short silence she fell asleep.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXXI\n\n\nThe sun had come out from behind the pear-tree that had shaded the\nwagon, and even through the branches that \xc3\x9astenka had fixed up it\nscorched the faces of the sleeping girls. Mary\xc3\xa1nka woke up and began\narranging the kerchief on her head. Looking about her, beyond the\npear-tree she noticed their lodger, who with his gun on his shoulder\nstood talking to her father. She nudged \xc3\x9astenka and smilingly pointed\nhim out to her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went yesterday and didn\xe2\x80\x99t find a single one,\xe2\x80\x9d Ol\xc3\xa9nin was saying as\nhe looked about uneasily, not seeing Mary\xc3\xa1nka through the branches.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you should go out there in that direction, go right as by\ncompasses, there in a disused vineyard denominated as the Waste, hares\nare always to be found,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cornet, having at once changed his\nmanner of speech.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fine thing to go looking for hares in these busy times! You had\nbetter come and help us, and do some work with the girls,\xe2\x80\x9d the old\nwoman said merrily. \xe2\x80\x9cNow then, girls, up with you!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka and \xc3\x9astenka under the cart were whispering and could hardly\nrestrain their laughter.\n\nSince it had become known that Ol\xc3\xa9nin had given a horse worth fifty\nrubles to Luk\xc3\xa1shka, his hosts had become more amiable and the cornet in\nparticular saw with pleasure his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s growing intimacy with\nOl\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to do the work,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ol\xc3\xa9nin, trying not to\nlook through the green branches under the wagon where he had now\nnoticed Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s blue smock and red kerchief.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you some peaches,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only according to the ancient Cossack hospitality. It\xe2\x80\x99s her old\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s silliness,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cornet, explaining and apparently\ncorrecting his wife\xe2\x80\x99s words. \xe2\x80\x9cIn Russia, I expect, it\xe2\x80\x99s not so much\npeaches as pineapple jam and preserves you have been accustomed to eat\nat your pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you say hares are to be found in the disused vineyard?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\nOl\xc3\xa9nin. \xe2\x80\x9cI will go there,\xe2\x80\x9d and throwing a hasty glance through the\ngreen branches he raised his cap and disappeared between the regular\nrows of green vines.\n\nThe sun had already sunk behind the fence of the vineyards, and its\nbroken rays glittered through the translucent leaves when Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nreturned to his host\xe2\x80\x99s vineyard. The wind was falling and a cool\nfreshness was beginning to spread around. By some instinct Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nrecognized from afar Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s blue smock among the rows of vine, and,\npicking grapes on his way, he approached her. His highly excited dog\nalso now and then seized a low-hanging cluster of grapes in his\nslobbering mouth. Mary\xc3\xa1nka, her face flushed, her sleeves rolled up,\nand her kerchief down below her chin, was rapidly cutting the heavy\nclusters and laying them in a basket. Without letting go of the vine\nshe had hold of, she stopped to smile pleasantly at him and resumed her\nwork. Ol\xc3\xa9nin drew near and threw his gun behind his back to have his\nhands free. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are your people? May God aid you! Are you alone?\xe2\x80\x9d he\nmeant to say but did not say, and only raised his cap in silence.\n\nHe was ill at ease alone with Mary\xc3\xa1nka, but as if purposely to torment\nhimself he went up to her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be shooting the women with your gun like that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary\xc3\xa1nka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I shan\xe2\x80\x99t shoot them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey were both silent.\n\nThen after a pause she said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou should help me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe took out his knife and began silently to cut off the clusters. He\nreached from under the leaves low down a thick bunch weighing about\nthree pounds, the grapes of which grew so close that they flattened\neach other for want of space. He showed it to Mary\xc3\xa1nka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust they all be cut? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t this one too green?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTheir hands touched. Ol\xc3\xa9nin took her hand, and she looked at him\nsmiling.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to be married soon?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\nShe did not answer, but turned away with a stern look.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you love Luk\xc3\xa1shka?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI envy him!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery likely!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo really. You are so beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd he suddenly felt terribly ashamed of having said it, so commonplace\ndid the words seem to him. He flushed, lost control of himself, and\nseized both her hands.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever I am, I\xe2\x80\x99m not for you. Why do you make fun of me?\xe2\x80\x9d replied\nMary\xc3\xa1nka, but her look showed how certainly she knew he was not making\nfun.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaking fun? If you only knew how I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe words sounded still more commonplace, they accorded still less with\nwhat he felt, but yet he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I would not do\nfor you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave me alone, you pitch!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut her face, her shining eyes, her swelling bosom, her shapely legs,\nsaid something quite different. It seemed to him that she understood\nhow petty were all things he had said, but that she was superior to\nsuch considerations. It seemed to him she had long known all he wished\nand was not able to tell her, but wanted to hear how he would say it.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how can she help knowing,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9csince I only want to tell\nher all that she herself is? But she does not wish to understand, does\nnot wish to reply.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo!\xe2\x80\x9d suddenly came \xc3\x9astenka\xe2\x80\x99s high voice from behind the vine at no\ngreat distance, followed by her shrill laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cCome and help me, Dm\xc3\xadtri\nAndr\xc3\xa9ich. I am all alone,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, thrusting her round, na\xc3\xafve little\nface through the vines.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin did not answer nor move from his place.\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka went on cutting and continually looked up at Ol\xc3\xa9nin. He was\nabout to say something, but stopped, shrugged his shoulders and, having\njerked up his gun, walked out of the vineyard with rapid strides.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXXII\n\n\nHe stopped once or twice, listening to the ringing laughter of Mary\xc3\xa1nka\nand \xc3\x9astenka who, having come together, were shouting something. Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nspent the whole evening hunting in the forest and returned home at dusk\nwithout having killed anything. When crossing the road he noticed her\nopen the door of the outhouse, and her blue smock showed through it. He\ncalled to Vany\xc3\xbasha very loud so as to let her know that he was back,\nand then sat down in the porch in his usual place. His hosts now\nreturned from the vineyard; they came out of the outhouse and into\ntheir hut, but did not ask him in. Mary\xc3\xa1nka went twice out of the gate.\nOnce in the twilight it seemed to him that she was looking at him. He\neagerly followed her every movement, but could not make up his mind to\napproach her. When she disappeared into the hut he left the porch and\nbegan pacing up and down the yard, but Mary\xc3\xa1nka did not come out again.\nOl\xc3\xa9nin spent the whole sleepless night out in the yard listening to\nevery sound in his hosts\xe2\x80\x99 hut. He heard them talking early in the\nevening, heard them having their supper and pulling out their cushions,\nand going to bed; he heard Mary\xc3\xa1nka laughing at something, and then\nheard everything growing gradually quiet.\n\nThe cornet and his wife talked a while in whispers, and someone was\nbreathing. Ol\xc3\xa9nin re-entered his hut. Vany\xc3\xbasha lay asleep in his\nclothes. Ol\xc3\xa9nin envied him, and again went out to pace the yard, always\nexpecting something, but no one came, no one moved, and he only heard\nthe regular breathing of three people. He knew Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s breathing and\nlistened to it and to the beating of his own heart. In the village\neverything was quiet. The waning moon rose late, and the deep-breathing\ncattle in the yard became more visible as they lay down and slowly\nrose. Ol\xc3\xa9nin angrily asked himself, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it I want?\xe2\x80\x9d but could not\ntear himself away from the enchantment of the night. Suddenly he\nthought he distinctly heard the floor creak and the sound of footsteps\nin his hosts\xe2\x80\x99 hut. He rushed to the door, but all was silent again\nexcept for the sound of regular breathing, and in the yard the\nbuffalo-cow, after a deep sigh, again moved, rose on her foreknees and\nthen on her feet, swished her tail, and something splashed steadily on\nthe dry clay ground; then she lay down again in the dim moonlight. He\nasked himself: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I to do?\xe2\x80\x9d and definitely decided to go to bed,\nbut again he heard a sound, and in his imagination there arose the\nimage of Mary\xc3\xa1nka coming out into this moonlit misty night, and again\nhe rushed to her window and again heard the sound of footsteps. Not\ntill just before dawn did he go up to her window and push at the\nshutter and then run to the door, and this time he really heard\nMary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s deep breathing and her footsteps. He took hold of the latch\nand knocked. The floor hardly creaked under the bare cautious footsteps\nwhich approached the door. The latch clicked, the door creaked, and he\nnoticed a faint smell of marjoram and pumpkin, and Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s whole\nfigure appeared in the doorway. He saw her only for an instant in the\nmoonlight. She slammed the door and, muttering something, ran lightly\nback again. Ol\xc3\xa9nin began rapping softly but nothing responded. He ran\nto the window and listened. Suddenly he was startled by a shrill,\nsqueaky man\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed a rather small young Cossack in a white cap, coming\nacross the yard close to Ol\xc3\xa9nin. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw ... fine!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin recognized Naz\xc3\xa1rka, and was silent, not knowing what to do or\nsay.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine! I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and tell them at the office, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell her father!\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s a fine cornet\xe2\x80\x99s daughter! One\xe2\x80\x99s not enough for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want of me, what are you after?\xe2\x80\x9d uttered Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing; only I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell them at the office.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka spoke very loud, and evidently did so intentionally, adding:\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust see what a clever cadet!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin trembled and grew pale.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here, here!\xe2\x80\x9d He seized the Cossack firmly by the arm and drew him\ntowards his hut.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing happened, she did not let me in, and I too mean no harm. She\nis an honest girl\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, discuss\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but all the same I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you something now. Wait a bit!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka said nothing. Ol\xc3\xa9nin ran into his hut and brought out ten\nrubles, which he gave to the Cossack.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing happened, but still I was to blame, so I give this!\xe2\x80\x94Only for\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s sake don\xe2\x80\x99t let anyone know, for nothing happened...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you joy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Naz\xc3\xa1rka laughing, and went away.\n\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka had come to the village that night at Luk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s bidding to\nfind a place to hide a stolen horse, and now, passing by on his way\nhome, had heard the sound of footsteps. When he returned next morning\nto his company he bragged to his chum, and told him how cleverly he had\ngot ten rubles. Next morning Ol\xc3\xa9nin met his hosts and they knew nothing\nabout the events of the night. He did not speak to Mary\xc3\xa1nka, and she\nonly laughed a little when she looked at him. Next night he also passed\nwithout sleep, vainly wandering about the yard. The day after he\npurposely spent shooting, and in the evening he went to see Bel\xc3\xa9tski to\nescape from his own thoughts. He was afraid of himself, and promised\nhimself not to go to his hosts\xe2\x80\x99 hut any more.\n\nThat night he was roused by the sergeant-major. His company was ordered\nto start at once on a raid. Ol\xc3\xa9nin was glad this had happened, and\nthought he would not again return to the village.\n\nThe raid lasted four days. The commander, who was a relative of\nOl\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s, wished to see him and offered to let him remain with the\nstaff, but this Ol\xc3\xa9nin declined. He found that he could not live away\nfrom the village, and asked to be allowed to return to it. For having\ntaken part in the raid he received a soldier\xe2\x80\x99s cross, which he had\nformerly greatly desired. Now he was quite indifferent about it, and\neven more indifferent about his promotion, the order for which had\nstill not arrived. Accompanied by Vany\xc3\xbasha he rode back to the cordon\nwithout any accident several hours in advance of the rest of the\ncompany. He spent the whole evening in his porch watching Mary\xc3\xa1nka, and\nhe again walked about the yard, without aim or thought, all night.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXXIII\n\n\nIt was late when he awoke the next day. His hosts were no longer in. He\ndid not go shooting, but now took up a book, and now went out into the\nporch, and now again re-entered the hut and lay down on the bed.\nVany\xc3\xbasha thought he was ill.\n\nTowards evening Ol\xc3\xa9nin got up, resolutely began writing, and wrote on\ntill late at night. He wrote a letter, but did not post it because he\nfelt that no one would have understood what he wanted to say, and\nbesides it was not necessary that anyone but himself should understand\nit.\n\nThis is what he wrote:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI receive letters of condolence from Russia. They are afraid that I\nshall perish, buried in these wilds. They say about me: \xe2\x80\x98He will become\ncoarse; he will be behind the times in everything; he will take to\ndrink, and who knows but that he may marry a Cossack girl.\xe2\x80\x99 It was not\nfor nothing, they say, that Erm\xc3\xb3lov declared: \xe2\x80\x98Anyone serving in the\nCaucasus for ten years either becomes a confirmed drunkard or marries a\nloose woman.\xe2\x80\x99 How terrible! Indeed it won\xe2\x80\x99t do for me to ruin myself\nwhen I might have the great happiness of even becoming the Countess\nB\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99s husband, or a Court chamberlain, or a _Mar\xc3\xa9chal de noblesse_ of\nmy district. Oh, how repulsive and pitiable you all seem to me! You do\nnot know what happiness is and what life is! One must taste life once\nin all its natural beauty, must see and understand what I see every day\nbefore me\xe2\x80\x94those eternally unapproachable snowy peaks, and a majestic\nwoman in that primitive beauty in which the first woman must have come\nfrom her creator\xe2\x80\x99s hands\xe2\x80\x94and then it becomes clear who is ruining\nhimself and who is living truly or falsely\xe2\x80\x94you or I. If you only knew\nhow despicable and pitiable you, in your delusions, seem to me! When I\npicture to myself\xe2\x80\x94in place of my hut, my forests, and my love\xe2\x80\x94those\ndrawing-rooms, those women with their pomatum-greased hair eked out\nwith false curls, those unnaturally grimacing lips, those hidden,\nfeeble, distorted limbs, and that chatter of obligatory drawing-room\nconversation which has no right to the name\xe2\x80\x94I feel unendurably\nrevolted. I then see before me those obtuse faces, those rich eligible\ngirls whose looks seem to say: \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s all right, you may come near\nthough I am rich and eligible\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94and that arranging and rearranging of\nseats, that shameless match-making and that eternal tittle-tattle and\npretence; those rules\xe2\x80\x94with whom to shake hands, to whom only to nod,\nwith whom to converse (and all this done deliberately with a conviction\nof its inevitability), that continual ennui in the blood passing on\nfrom generation to generation. Try to understand or believe just this\none thing: you need only see and comprehend what truth and beauty are,\nand all that you now say and think and all your wishes for me and for\nyourselves will fly to atoms!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHappiness is being with nature, seeing her, and conversing with her.\n\xe2\x80\x98He may even (God forbid) marry a common Cossack girl, and be quite\nlost socially\xe2\x80\x99 I can imagine them saying of me with sincere pity! Yet\nthe one thing I desire is to be quite \xe2\x80\x98lost\xe2\x80\x99 in your sense of the word.\nI wish to marry a Cossack girl, and dare not because it would be a\nheight of happiness of which I am unworthy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree months have passed since I first saw the Cossack girl, Mary\xc3\xa1nka.\nThe views and prejudices of the world I had left were still fresh in\nme. I did not then believe that I could love that woman. I delighted in\nher beauty just as I delighted in the beauty of the mountains and the\nsky, nor could I help delighting in her, for she is as beautiful as\nthey. I found that the sight of her beauty had become a necessity of my\nlife and I began asking myself whether I did not love her. But I could\nfind nothing within myself at all like love as I had imagined it to be.\nMine was not the restlessness of loneliness and desire for marriage,\nnor was it platonic, still less a carnal love such as I have\nexperienced. I needed only to see her, to hear her, to know that she\nwas near\xe2\x80\x94and if I was not happy, I was at peace.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter an evening gathering at which I met her and touched her, I felt\nthat between that woman and myself there existed an indissoluble though\nunacknowledged bond against which I could not struggle, yet I did\nstruggle. I asked myself: \xe2\x80\x98Is it possible to love a woman who will\nnever understand the profoundest interests of my life? Is it possible\nto love a woman simply for her beauty, to love the statue of a woman?\xe2\x80\x99\nBut I was already in love with her, though I did not yet trust to my\nfeelings.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter that evening when I first spoke to her our relations changed.\nBefore that she had been to me an extraneous but majestic object of\nexternal nature: but since then she has become a human being. I began\nto meet her, to talk to her, and sometimes to go to work for her father\nand to spend whole evenings with them, and in this intimate intercourse\nshe remained still in my eyes just as pure, inaccessible, and majestic.\nShe always responded with equal calm, pride, and cheerful equanimity.\nSometimes she was friendly, but generally her every look, every word,\nand every movement expressed equanimity\xe2\x80\x94not contemptuous, but crushing\nand bewitching. Every day with a feigned smile on my lips I tried to\nplay a part, and with torments of passion and desire in my heart I\nspoke banteringly to her. She saw that I was dissembling, but looked\nstraight at me cheerfully and simply. This position became unbearable.\nI wished not to deceive her but to tell her all I thought and felt. I\nwas extremely agitated. We were in the vineyard when I began to tell\nher of my love, in words I am now ashamed to remember. I am ashamed\nbecause I ought not to have dared to speak so to her because she stood\nfar above such words and above the feeling they were meant to express.\nI said no more, but from that day my position has been intolerable. I\ndid not wish to demean myself by continuing our former flippant\nrelations, and at the same time I felt that I had not yet reached the\nlevel of straight and simple relations with her. I asked myself\ndespairingly, \xe2\x80\x98What am I to do?\xe2\x80\x99 In foolish dreams I imagined her now\nas my mistress and now as my wife, but rejected both ideas with\ndisgust. To make her a wanton woman would be dreadful. It would be\nmurder. To turn her into a fine lady, the wife of Dm\xc3\xadtri Andr\xc3\xa9ich\nOl\xc3\xa9nin, like a Cossack woman here who is married to one of our\nofficers, would be still worse. Now could I turn Cossack like Luk\xc3\xa1shka,\nand steal horses, get drunk on _chikhir_, sing rollicking songs, kill\npeople, and when drunk climb in at her window for the night without a\nthought of who and what I am, it would be different: then we might\nunderstand one another and I might be happy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tried to throw myself into that kind of life but was still more\nconscious of my own weakness and artificiality. I cannot forget myself\nand my complex, distorted past, and my future appears to me still more\nhopeless. Every day I have before me the distant snowy mountains and\nthis majestic, happy woman. But not for me is the only happiness\npossible in the world; I cannot have this woman! What is most terrible\nand yet sweetest in my condition is that I feel that I understand her\nbut that she will never understand me; not because she is inferior: on\nthe contrary she ought not to understand me. She is happy, she is like\nnature: consistent, calm, and self-contained; and I, a weak distorted\nbeing, want her to understand my deformity and my torments! I have not\nslept at night, but have aimlessly passed under her windows not\nrendering account to myself of what was happening to me. On the 18th\nour company started on a raid, and I spent three days away from the\nvillage. I was sad and apathetic, the usual songs, cards,\ndrinking-bouts, and talk of rewards in the regiment, were more\nrepulsive to me than usual. Yesterday I returned home and saw her, my\nhut. Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka, and the snowy mountains, from my porch, and was\nseized by such a strong, new feeling of joy that I understood it all. I\nlove this woman; I feel real love for the first and only time in my\nlife. I know what has befallen me. I do not fear to be degraded by this\nfeeling, I am not ashamed of my love, I am proud of it. It is not my\nfault that I love. It has come about against my will. I tried to escape\nfrom my love by self-renunciation, and tried to devise a joy in the\nCossack Luk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s and Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s love, but thereby only stirred up my\nown love and jealousy. This is not the ideal, the so-called exalted\nlove which I have known before; not that sort of attachment in which\nyou admire your own love and feel that the source of your emotion is\nwithin yourself and do everything yourself. I have felt that too. It is\nstill less a desire for enjoyment: it is something different. Perhaps\nin her I love nature: the personification of all that is beautiful in\nnature; but yet I am not acting by my own will, but some elemental\nforce loves through me; the whole of God\xe2\x80\x99s world, all nature, presses\nthis love into my soul and says, \xe2\x80\x98Love her.\xe2\x80\x99 I love her not with my\nmind or my imagination, but with my whole being. Loving her I feel\nmyself to be an integral part of all God\xe2\x80\x99s joyous world. I wrote before\nabout the new convictions to which my solitary life had brought me, but\nno one knows with what labour they shaped themselves within me and with\nwhat joy I realized them and saw a new way of life opening out before\nme; nothing was dearer to me than those convictions... Well! ... love\nhas come and neither they nor any regrets for them remain! It is even\ndifficult for me to believe that I could prize such a one-sided, cold,\nand abstract state of mind. Beauty came and scattered to the winds all\nthat laborious inward toil, and no regret remains for what has\nvanished! Self-renunciation is all nonsense and absurdity! That is\npride, a refuge from well-merited unhappiness, and salvation from the\nenvy of others\xe2\x80\x99 happiness: \xe2\x80\x98Live for others, and do good!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94Why? when in\nmy soul there is only love for myself and the desire to love her and to\nlive her life with her? Not for others, not for Luk\xc3\xa1shka, I now desire\nhappiness. I do not now love those others. Formerly I should have told\nmyself that this is wrong. I should have tormented myself with the\nquestions: What will become of her, of me, and of Luk\xc3\xa1shka? Now I don\xe2\x80\x99t\ncare. I do not live my own life, there is something stronger than me\nwhich directs me. I suffer; but formerly I was dead and only now do I\nlive. Today I will go to their house and tell her everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXXIV\n\n\nLate that evening, after writing this letter, Ol\xc3\xa9nin went to his hosts\xe2\x80\x99\nhut. The old woman was sitting on a bench behind the oven unwinding\ncocoons. Mary\xc3\xa1nka with her head uncovered sat sewing by the light of a\ncandle. On seeing Ol\xc3\xa9nin she jumped up, took her kerchief and stepped\nto the oven.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary\xc3\xa1nka dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said her mother, \xe2\x80\x9cwon\xe2\x80\x99t you sit here with me a bit?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m bareheaded,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, and sprang up on the oven.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin could only see a knee, and one of her shapely legs hanging down\nfrom the oven. He treated the old woman to tea. She treated her guest\nto clotted cream which she sent Mary\xc3\xa1nka to fetch. But having put a\nplateful on the table Mary\xc3\xa1nka again sprang on the oven from whence\nOl\xc3\xa9nin felt her eyes upon him. They talked about household matters.\nGranny Ul\xc3\xadtka became animated and went into raptures of hospitality.\nShe brought Ol\xc3\xa9nin preserved grapes and a grape tart and some of her\nbest wine, and pressed him to eat and drink with the rough yet proud\nhospitality of country folk, only found among those who produce their\nbread by the labour of their own hands.\n\nThe old woman, who had at first struck Ol\xc3\xa9nin so much by her rudeness,\nnow often touched him by her simple tenderness towards her daughter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we need not offend the Lord by grumbling! We have enough of\neverything, thank God. We have pressed sufficient _chikhir_ and have\npreserved and shall sell three or four barrels of grapes and have\nenough left to drink. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be in a hurry to leave us. We will make\nmerry together at the wedding.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when is the wedding to be?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin, feeling his blood\nsuddenly rush to his face while his heart beat irregularly and\npainfully.\n\nHe heard a movement on the oven and the sound of seeds being cracked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know, it ought to be next week. We are quite ready,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\nthe old woman, as simply and quietly as though Ol\xc3\xa9nin did not exist. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nhave prepared and have procured everything for Mary\xc3\xa1nka. We will give\nher away properly. Only there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing not quite right. Our Luk\xc3\xa1shka\nhas been running rather wild. He has been too much on the spree! He\xe2\x80\x99s\nup to tricks! The other day a Cossack came here from his company and\nsaid he had been to Nog\xc3\xa1y.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must mind he does not get caught,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I tell him. \xe2\x80\x98Mind, Luk\xc3\xa1shka, don\xe2\x80\x99t you get into\nmischief. Well, of course, a young fellow naturally wants to cut a\ndash. But there\xe2\x80\x99s a time for everything. Well, you\xe2\x80\x99ve captured or\nstolen something and killed an _abrek!_ Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re a fine fellow! But\nnow you should live quietly for a bit, or else there\xe2\x80\x99ll be trouble.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I saw him a time or two in the division, he was always\nmerry-making. He has sold another horse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin, and glanced\ntowards the oven. A pair of large, dark, and hostile eyes glittered as\nthey gazed severely at him.\n\nHe became ashamed of what he had said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat of it? He does no one any\nharm,\xe2\x80\x9d suddenly remarked Mary\xc3\xa1nka. \xe2\x80\x9cHe makes merry with his own money,\xe2\x80\x9d\nand lowering her legs she jumped down from the oven and went out\nbanging the door.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin followed her with his eyes as long as she was in the hut, and\nthen looked at the door and waited, understanding nothing of what\nGranny Ul\xc3\xadtka was telling him.\n\nA few minutes later some visitors arrived: an old man, Granny Ul\xc3\xadtka\xe2\x80\x99s\nbrother, with Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka, and following them came Mary\xc3\xa1nka and\n\xc3\x9astenka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood evening,\xe2\x80\x9d squeaked \xc3\x9astenka. \xe2\x80\x9cStill on holiday?\xe2\x80\x9d she added,\nturning to Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, still on holiday,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, and felt, he did not know why,\nashamed and ill at ease.\n\nHe wished to go away but could not. It also seemed to him impossible to\nremain silent. The old man helped him by asking for a drink, and they\nhad a drink. Ol\xc3\xa9nin drank with Er\xc3\xb3shka, with the other Cossack, and\nagain with Er\xc3\xb3shka, and the more he drank the heavier was his heart.\nBut the two old men grew merry. The girls climbed onto the oven, where\nthey sat whispering and looking at the men, who drank till it was late.\nOl\xc3\xa9nin did not talk, but drank more than the others. The Cossacks were\nshouting. The old woman would not let them have any more _chikhir_, and\nat last turned them out. The girls laughed at Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka, and it was\npast ten when they all went out into the porch. The old men invited\nthemselves to finish their merry-making at Ol\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s. \xc3\x9astenka ran off\nhome and Er\xc3\xb3shka led the old Cossack to Vany\xc3\xbasha. The old woman went\nout to tidy up the shed. Mary\xc3\xa1nka remained alone in the hut. Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nfelt fresh and joyous, as if he had only just woke up. He noticed\neverything, and having let the old men pass ahead he turned back to the\nhut where Mary\xc3\xa1nka was preparing for bed. He went up to her and wished\nto say something, but his voice broke. She moved away from him, sat\ndown cross-legged on her bed in the corner, and looked at him silently\nwith wild and frightened eyes. She was evidently afraid of him. Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nfelt this. He felt sorry and ashamed of himself, and at the same time\nproud and pleased that he aroused even that feeling in her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary\xc3\xa1nka!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you never take pity on me? I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you\nhow I love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe moved still farther away.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust hear how the wine is speaking! ... You\xe2\x80\x99ll get nothing from me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it is not the wine. Don\xe2\x80\x99t marry Luk\xc3\xa1shka. I will marry you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n(\xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I saying,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought as he uttered these words. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I be\nable to say the same tomorrow?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I shall, I am sure I shall, and I\nwill repeat them now,\xe2\x80\x9d replied an inner voice.)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you marry me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe looked at him seriously and her fear seemed to have passed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary\xc3\xa1nka, I shall go out of my mind! I am not myself. I will do\nwhatever you command,\xe2\x80\x9d and madly tender words came from his lips of\ntheir own accord.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, what are you drivelling about?\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted, suddenly\nseizing the arm he was stretching towards her. She did not push his arm\naway but pressed it firmly with her strong hard fingers. \xe2\x80\x9cDo gentlemen\nmarry Cossack girls? Go away!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut will you? Everything...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what shall we do with Luk\xc3\xa1shka?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, laughing.\n\nHe snatched away the arm she was holding and firmly embraced her young\nbody, but she sprang away like a fawn and ran barefoot into the porch:\nOl\xc3\xa9nin came to his senses and was terrified at himself. He again felt\nhimself inexpressibly vile compared to her, yet not repenting for an\ninstant of what he had said he went home, and without even glancing at\nthe old men who were drinking in his room he lay down and fell asleep\nmore soundly than he had done for a long time.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXXV\n\n\nThe next day was a holiday. In the evening all the villagers, their\nholiday clothes shining in the sunset, were out in the street. That\nseason more wine than usual had been produced, and the people were now\nfree from their labours. In a month the Cossacks were to start on a\ncampaign and in many families preparations were being made for\nweddings.\n\nMost of the people were standing in the square in front of the Cossack\nGovernment Office and near the two shops, in one of which cakes and\npumpkin seeds were sold, in the other kerchiefs and cotton prints. On\nthe earth-embankment of the office-building sat or stood the old men in\nsober grey, or black coats without gold trimmings or any kind of\nornament. They conversed among themselves quietly in measured tones,\nabout the harvest, about the young folk, about village affairs, and\nabout old times, looking with dignified equanimity at the younger\ngeneration. Passing by them, the women and girls stopped and bent their\nheads. The young Cossacks respectfully slackened their pace and raised\ntheir caps, holding them for a while over their heads. The old men then\nstopped speaking. Some of them watched the passers-by severely, others\nkindly, and in their turn slowly took off their caps and put them on\nagain.\n\nThe Cossack girls had not yet started dancing their _khorov\xc3\xb3ds_, but\nhaving gathered in groups, in their bright coloured _beshmets_ with\nwhite kerchiefs on their heads pulled down to their eyes, they sat\neither on the ground or on the earth-banks about the huts sheltered\nfrom the oblique rays of the sun, and laughed and chattered in their\nringing voices. Little boys and girls playing in the square sent their\nballs high up into the clear sky, and ran about squealing and shouting.\nThe half-grown girls had started dancing their _khorov\xc3\xb3ds_, and were\ntimidly singing in their thin shrill voices. Clerks, lads not in the\nservice, or home for the holiday, bright-faced and wearing smart white\nor new red Circassian gold-trimmed coats, went about arm in arm in twos\nor threes from one group of women or girls to another, and stopped to\njoke and chat with the Cossack girls. The Armenian shopkeeper, in a\ngold-trimmed coat of fine blue cloth, stood at the open door through\nwhich piles of folded bright-coloured kerchiefs were visible and,\nconscious of his own importance and with the pride of an Oriental\ntradesman, waited for customers. Two red-bearded, barefooted Ch\xc3\xa9chens,\nwho had come from beyond the T\xc3\xa9rek to see the f\xc3\xaate, sat on their heels\noutside the house of a friend, negligently smoking their little pipes\nand occasionally spitting, watching the villagers and exchanging\nremarks with one another in their rapid guttural speech. Occasionally a\nworkaday-looking soldier in an old overcoat passed across the square\namong the bright-clad girls. Here and there the songs of tipsy Cossacks\nwho were merry-making could already be heard. All the huts were closed;\nthe porches had been scrubbed clean the day before. Even the old women\nwere out in the street, which was everywhere sprinkled with pumpkin and\nmelon seed-shells. The air was warm and still, the sky deep and clear.\nBeyond the roofs the dead-white mountain range, which seemed very near,\nwas turning rosy in the glow of the evening sun. Now and then from the\nother side of the river came the distant roar of a cannon, but above\nthe village, mingling with one another, floated all sorts of merry\nholiday sounds.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin had been pacing the yard all that morning hoping to see\nMary\xc3\xa1nka. But she, having put on holiday clothes, went to Mass at the\nchapel and afterwards sat with the other girls on an earth-embankment\ncracking seeds; sometimes again, together with her companions, she ran\nhome, and each time gave the lodger a bright and kindly look. Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nfelt afraid to address her playfully or in the presence of others. He\nwished to finish telling her what he had begun to say the night before,\nand to get her to give him a definite answer. He waited for another\nmoment like that of yesterday evening, but the moment did not come, and\nhe felt that he could not remain any longer in this uncertainty. She\nwent out into the street again, and after waiting awhile he too went\nout and without knowing where he was going he followed her. He passed\nby the corner where she was sitting in her shining blue satin\n_beshmet_, and with an aching heart he heard behind him the girls\nlaughing.\n\nBel\xc3\xa9tski\xe2\x80\x99s hut looked out onto the square. As Ol\xc3\xa9nin was passing it he\nheard Bel\xc3\xa9tski\xe2\x80\x99s voice calling to him, \xe2\x80\x9cCome in,\xe2\x80\x9d and in he went.\n\nAfter a short talk they both sat down by the window and were soon\njoined by Er\xc3\xb3shka, who entered dressed in a new _beshmet_ and sat down\non the floor beside them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, that\xe2\x80\x99s the aristocratic party,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bel\xc3\xa9tski, pointing with\nhis cigarette to a brightly coloured group at the corner. \xe2\x80\x9cMine is\nthere too. Do you see her? in red. That\xe2\x80\x99s a new _beshmet_. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t\nyou start the _khorov\xc3\xb3d?_\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, leaning out of the window. \xe2\x80\x9cWait\na bit, and then when it grows dark let us go too. Then we will invite\nthem to \xc3\x9astenka\xe2\x80\x99s. We must arrange a ball for them!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I will come to \xc3\x9astenka\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin in a decided tone. \xe2\x80\x9cWill\nMary\xc3\xa1nka be there?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be there. Do come!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bel\xc3\xa9tski, without the least\nsurprise. \xe2\x80\x9cBut isn\xe2\x80\x99t it a pretty picture?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, pointing to the\nmotley crowds.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, very!\xe2\x80\x9d Ol\xc3\xa9nin assented, trying to appear indifferent.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHolidays of this kind,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9calways make me wonder why all these\npeople should suddenly be contented and jolly. Today for instance, just\nbecause it happens to be the fifteenth of the month, everything is\nfestive. Eyes and faces and voices and movements and garments, and the\nair and the sun, are all in a holiday mood. And we no longer have any\nholidays!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bel\xc3\xa9tski, who did not like such reflections.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why are you not drinking, old fellow?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning to\nEr\xc3\xb3shka.\n\nEr\xc3\xb3shka winked at Ol\xc3\xa9nin, pointing to Bel\xc3\xa9tski. \xe2\x80\x9cEh, he\xe2\x80\x99s a proud one\nthat _kunak_ of yours,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nBel\xc3\xa9tski raised his glass.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Allah birdy!_\xe2\x80\x9d he said, emptying it. (_Allah birdy_, \xe2\x80\x9cGod has\ngiven!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the usual greeting of Caucasians when drinking together.)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Sau bul_\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cYour health\xe2\x80\x9d), answered Er\xc3\xb3shka smiling, and emptied his\nglass.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeaking of holidays!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning to Ol\xc3\xa9nin as he rose and\nlooked out of the window, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of holiday is that! You should\nhave seen them make merry in the old days! The women used to come out\nin their gold-trimmed _saraf\xc3\xa1ns_. Two rows of gold coins hanging round\ntheir necks and gold-cloth diadems on their heads, and when they passed\nthey made a noise, \xe2\x80\x98flu, flu,\xe2\x80\x99 with their dresses. Every woman looked\nlike a princess. Sometimes they\xe2\x80\x99d come out, a whole herd of them, and\nbegin singing songs so that the air seemed to rumble, and they went on\nmaking merry all night. And the Cossacks would roll out a barrel into\nthe yards and sit down and drink till break of day, or they would go\nhand-in-hand sweeping the village. Whoever they met they seized and\ntook along with them, and went from house to house. Sometimes they used\nto make merry for three days on end. Father used to come home\xe2\x80\x94I still\nremember it\xe2\x80\x94quite red and swollen, without a cap, having lost\neverything: he\xe2\x80\x99d come and lie down. Mother knew what to do: she would\nbring him some fresh caviar and a little _chikhir_ to sober him up, and\nwould herself run about in the village looking for his cap. Then he\xe2\x80\x99d\nsleep for two days! That\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of fellows they were then! But now\nwhat are they?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and the girls in the _saraf\xc3\xa1ns_, did they make merry all by\nthemselves?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bel\xc3\xa9tski.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, they did! Sometimes Cossacks would come on foot or on horse and\nsay, \xe2\x80\x98Let\xe2\x80\x99s break up the _khorov\xc3\xb3ds_,\xe2\x80\x99 and they\xe2\x80\x99d go, but the girls\nwould take up cudgels. Carnival week, some young fellow would come\ngalloping up, and they\xe2\x80\x99d cudgel his horse and cudgel him too. But he\xe2\x80\x99d\nbreak through, seize the one he loved, and carry her off. And his\nsweetheart would love him to his heart\xe2\x80\x99s content! Yes, the girls in\nthose days, they were regular queens!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXXVI\n\n\nJust then two men rode out of the side street into the square. One of\nthem was Naz\xc3\xa1rka. The other, Luk\xc3\xa1shka, sat slightly sideways on his\nwell-fed bay Kabard\xc3\xa1 horse which stepped lightly over the hard road\njerking its beautiful head with its fine glossy mane. The well-adjusted\ngun in its cover, the pistol at his back, and the cloak rolled up\nbehind his saddle showed that Luk\xc3\xa1shka had not come from a peaceful\nplace or from one near by. The smart way in which he sat a little\nsideways on his horse, the careless motion with which he touched the\nhorse under its belly with his whip, and especially his half-closed\nblack eyes, glistening as he looked proudly around him, all expressed\nthe conscious strength and self-confidence of youth. \xe2\x80\x9cEver seen as fine\na lad?\xe2\x80\x9d his eyes, looking from side to side, seemed to say. The elegant\nhorse with its silver ornaments and trappings, the weapons, and the\nhandsome Cossack himself attracted the attention of everyone in the\nsquare. Naz\xc3\xa1rka, lean and short, was much less well dressed. As he rode\npast the old men, Luk\xc3\xa1shka paused and raised his curly white sheepskin\ncap above his closely cropped black head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, have you carried off many Nog\xc3\xa1y horses?\xe2\x80\x9d asked a lean old man\nwith a frowning, lowering look.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you counted them, Grandad, that you ask?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Luk\xc3\xa1shka,\nturning away.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all very well, but you need not take my lad along with you,\xe2\x80\x9d\nthe old man muttered with a still darker frown.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust see the old devil, he knows everything,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Luk\xc3\xa1shka to\nhimself, and a worried expression came over his face; but then,\nnoticing a corner where a number of Cossack girls were standing, he\nturned his horse towards them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood evening, girls!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted in his powerful, resonant voice,\nsuddenly checking his horse. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve grown old without me, you\nwitches!\xe2\x80\x9d and he laughed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood evening, Luk\xc3\xa1shka! Good evening, laddie!\xe2\x80\x9d the merry voices\nanswered. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you brought much money? Buy some sweets for the\ngirls!... Have you come for long? True enough, it\xe2\x80\x99s long since we saw\nyou....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNaz\xc3\xa1rka and I have just flown across to make a night of it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka, raising his whip and riding straight at the girls.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mary\xc3\xa1nka has quite forgotten you,\xe2\x80\x9d said \xc3\x9astenka, nudging Mary\xc3\xa1nka\nwith her elbow and breaking into a shrill laugh.\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka moved away from the horse and throwing back her head calmly\nlooked at the Cossack with her large sparkling eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue enough, you have not been home for a long time! Why are you\ntrampling us under your horse?\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked dryly, and turned away.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka had appeared particularly merry. His face shone with audacity\nand joy. Obviously staggered by Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s cold reply he suddenly\nknitted his brow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStep up on my stirrup and I\xe2\x80\x99ll carry you away to the mountains.\nMammy!\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly exclaimed, and as if to disperse his dark thoughts\nhe caracoled among the girls. Stooping down towards Mary\xc3\xa1nka, he said,\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll kiss, oh, how I\xe2\x80\x99ll kiss you! ...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s eyes met his and she suddenly blushed and stepped back.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, bother you! you\xe2\x80\x99ll crush my feet,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and bending her head\nlooked at her well-shaped feet in their tightly fitting light blue\nstockings with clocks and her new red slippers trimmed with narrow\nsilver braid.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka turned towards \xc3\x9astenka, and Mary\xc3\xa1nka sat down next to a woman\nwith a baby in her arms. The baby stretched his plump little hands\ntowards the girl and seized a necklace string that hung down onto her\nblue _beshmet_. Mary\xc3\xa1nka bent towards the child and glanced at Luk\xc3\xa1shka\nfrom the corner of her eyes. Luk\xc3\xa1shka just then was getting out from\nunder his coat, from the pocket of his black _beshmet_, a bundle of\nsweetmeats and seeds.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, I give them to all of you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, handing the bundle to\n\xc3\x9astenka and smiling at Mary\xc3\xa1nka.\n\nA confused expression again appeared on the girl\xe2\x80\x99s face. It was as\nthough a mist gathered over her beautiful eyes. She drew her kerchief\ndown below her lips, and leaning her head over the fair-skinned face of\nthe baby that still held her by her coin necklace she suddenly began to\nkiss it greedily. The baby pressed his little hands against the girl\xe2\x80\x99s\nhigh breasts, and opening his toothless mouth screamed loudly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re smothering the boy!\xe2\x80\x9d said the little one\xe2\x80\x99s mother, taking him\naway; and she unfastened her _beshmet_ to give him the breast. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d\nbetter have a chat with the young fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll only go and put up my horse and then Naz\xc3\xa1rka and I will come\nback; we\xe2\x80\x99ll make merry all night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, touching his horse\nwith his whip and riding away from the girls.\n\nTurning into a side street, he and Naz\xc3\xa1rka rode up to two huts that\nstood side by side.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere we are all right, old fellow! Be quick and come soon!\xe2\x80\x9d called\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka to his comrade, dismounting in front of one of the huts; then\nhe carefully led his horse in at the gate of the wattle fence of his\nown home.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow d\xe2\x80\x99you do, St\xc3\xabpka?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to his dumb sister, who, smartly\ndressed like the others, came in from the street to take his horse; and\nhe made signs to her to take the horse to the hay, but not to unsaddle\nit.\n\nThe dumb girl made her usual humming noise, smacked her lips as she\npointed to the horse and kissed it on the nose, as much as to say that\nshe loved it and that it was a fine horse.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow d\xe2\x80\x99you do, Mother? How is it that you have not gone out yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\nshouted Luk\xc3\xa1shka, holding his gun in place as he mounted the steps of\nthe porch.\n\nHis old mother opened the door.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me! I never expected, never thought, you\xe2\x80\x99d come,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old\nwoman. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, K\xc3\xadrka said you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and bring some _chikhir_, Mother. Naz\xc3\xa1rka is coming here and we\nwill celebrate the feast day.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDirectly, Luk\xc3\xa1shka, directly!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the old woman. \xe2\x80\x9cOur women are\nmaking merry. I expect our dumb one has gone too.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe took her keys and hurriedly went to the outhouse. Naz\xc3\xa1rka, after\nputting up his horse and taking the gun off his shoulder, returned to\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s house and went in.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXXVII\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour health!\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, taking from his mother\xe2\x80\x99s hands a cup\nfilled to the brim with _chikhir_ and carefully raising it to his bowed\nhead.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bad business!\xe2\x80\x9d said Naz\xc3\xa1rka. \xe2\x80\x9cYou heard how Daddy Burl\xc3\xa1k said, \xe2\x80\x98Have\nyou stolen many horses?\xe2\x80\x99 He seems to know!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA regular wizard!\xe2\x80\x9d Luk\xc3\xa1shka replied shortly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what of it!\xe2\x80\x9d he\nadded, tossing his head. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are across the river by now. Go and find\nthem!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill it\xe2\x80\x99s a bad lookout.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s a bad lookout? Go and take some _chikhir_ to him tomorrow and\nnothing will come of it. Now let\xe2\x80\x99s make merry. Drink!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka, just in the tone in which old Er\xc3\xb3shka uttered the word.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll go out into the street and make merry with the girls. You go and\nget some honey; or no, I\xe2\x80\x99ll send our dumb wench. We\xe2\x80\x99ll make merry till\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka smiled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre we stopping here long?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTill we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a bit of fun. Run and get some vodka. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the\nmoney.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka ran off obediently to get the vodka from Y\xc3\xa1mka\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\nDaddy Er\xc3\xb3shka and Ergush\xc3\xb3v, like birds of prey, scenting where the\nmerry-making was going on, tumbled into the hut one after the other,\nboth tipsy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring us another half-pail,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Luk\xc3\xa1shka to his mother, by way of\nreply to their greeting.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, tell us where did you steal them, you devil?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted\nEr\xc3\xb3shka. \xe2\x80\x9cFine fellow, I\xe2\x80\x99m fond of you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFond indeed...\xe2\x80\x9d answered Luk\xc3\xa1shka laughing, \xe2\x80\x9ccarrying sweets from\ncadets to lasses! Eh, you old...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not true, not true! ... Oh, Mark,\xe2\x80\x9d and the old man burst out\nlaughing. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how that devil begged me. \xe2\x80\x98Go,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98and arrange\nit.\xe2\x80\x99 He offered me a gun! But no. I\xe2\x80\x99d have managed it, but I feel for\nyou. Now tell us where have you been?\xe2\x80\x9d And the old man began speaking\nin Tartar.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka answered him promptly.\n\nErgush\xc3\xb3v, who did not know much Tartar, only occasionally put in a word\nin Russian: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I say is he\xe2\x80\x99s driven away the horses. I know it for a\nfact,\xe2\x80\x9d he chimed in.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGir\xc3\xa9y and I went together.\xe2\x80\x9d (His speaking of Gir\xc3\xa9y Khan as \xe2\x80\x9cGir\xc3\xa9y\xe2\x80\x9d\nwas, to the Cossack mind, evidence of his boldness.) \xe2\x80\x9cJust beyond the\nriver he kept bragging that he knew the whole of the steppe and would\nlead the way straight, but we rode on and the night was dark, and my\nGir\xc3\xa9y lost his way and began wandering in a circle without getting\nanywhere: couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find the village, and there we were. We must have\ngone too much to the right. I believe we wandered about well-nigh till\nmidnight. Then, thank goodness, we heard dogs howling.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFools!\xe2\x80\x9d said Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka. \xe2\x80\x9cThere now, we too used to lose our way in\nthe steppe. (Who the devil can follow it?) But I used to ride up a\nhillock and start howling like the wolves, like this!\xe2\x80\x9d He placed his\nhands before his mouth, and howled like a pack of wolves, all on one\nnote. \xe2\x80\x9cThe dogs would answer at once ... Well, go on\xe2\x80\x94so you found\nthem?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe soon led them away! Naz\xc3\xa1rka was nearly caught by some Nog\xc3\xa1y women,\nhe was!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaught indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d Naz\xc3\xa1rka, who had just come back, said in an injured\ntone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe rode off again, and again Gir\xc3\xa9y lost his way and almost landed us\namong the sand-drifts. We thought we were just getting to the T\xc3\xa9rek but\nwe were riding away from it all the time!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should have steered by the stars,\xe2\x80\x9d said Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I say,\xe2\x80\x9d interjected Ergush\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, steer when all is black; I tried and tried all about... and at\nlast I put the bridle on one of the mares and let my own horse go\nfree\xe2\x80\x94thinking he\xe2\x80\x99ll lead us out, and what do you think! he just gave a\nsnort or two with his nose to the ground, galloped ahead, and led us\nstraight to our village. Thank goodness! It was getting quite light. We\nbarely had time to hide them in the forest. Nag\xc3\xadm came across the river\nand took them away.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nErgush\xc3\xb3v shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just what I said. Smart. Did you get\nmuch for them?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, slapping his pocket.\n\nJust then his mother came into the room, and Luk\xc3\xa1shka did not finish\nwhat he was saying.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrink!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe too, G\xc3\xadrich and I, rode out late one night...\xe2\x80\x9d began Er\xc3\xb3shka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh bother, we\xe2\x80\x99ll never hear the end of you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\ngoing.\xe2\x80\x9d And having emptied his cup and tightened the strap of his belt\nhe went out.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXXVIII\n\n\nIt was already dark when Luk\xc3\xa1shka went out into the street. The autumn\nnight was fresh and calm. The full golden moon floated up behind the\ntall dark poplars that grew on one side of the square. From the\nchimneys of the outhouses smoke rose and spread above the village,\nmingling with the mist. Here and there lights shone through the\nwindows, and the air was laden with the smell of _kisyak_, grape-pulp,\nand mist. The sounds of voices, laughter, songs, and the cracking of\nseeds mingled just as they had done in the daytime, but were now more\ndistinct. Clusters of white kerchiefs and caps gleamed through the\ndarkness near the houses and by the fences.\n\nIn the square, before the shop door which was lit up and open, the\nblack and white figures of Cossack men and maids showed through the\ndarkness, and one heard from afar their loud songs and laughter and\ntalk. The girls, hand in hand, went round and round in a circle\nstepping lightly in the dusty square. A skinny girl, the plainest of\nthem all, set the tune:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom beyond the wood, from the forest dark,\nFrom the garden green and the shady park,\nThere came out one day two young lads so gay.\nYoung bachelors, hey! brave and smart were they!\nAnd they walked and walked, then stood still, each man,\nAnd they talked and soon to dispute began!\nThen a maid came out; as she came along,\nSaid, \xe2\x80\x98To one of you I shall soon belong!\xe2\x80\x99\n\xe2\x80\x99Twas the fair-faced lad got the maiden fair,\nYes, the fair-faced lad with the golden hair!\nHer right hand so white in his own took he,\nAnd he led her round for his mates to see!\nAnd said, \xe2\x80\x98Have you ever in all your life,\nMet a lass as fair as my sweet little wife?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nThe old women stood round listening to the songs. The little boys and\ngirls ran about chasing one another in the dark. The men stood by,\ncatching at the girls as the latter moved round, and sometimes breaking\nthe ring and entering it. On the dark side of the doorway stood\nBel\xc3\xa9tski and Ol\xc3\xa9nin, in their Circassian coats and sheepskin caps, and\ntalked together in a style of speech unlike that of the Cossacks, in\nlow but distinct tones, conscious that they were attracting attention.\n\nNext to one another in the _khorov\xc3\xb3d_ circle moved plump little \xc3\x9astenka\nin her red _beshmet_ and the stately Mary\xc3\xa1nka in her new smock and\n_beshmet_. Ol\xc3\xa9nin and Bel\xc3\xa9tski were discussing how to snatch \xc3\x9astenka\nand Mary\xc3\xa1nka out of the ring. Bel\xc3\xa9tski thought that Ol\xc3\xa9nin wished only\nto amuse himself, but Ol\xc3\xa9nin was expecting his fate to be decided. He\nwanted at any cost to see Mary\xc3\xa1nka alone that very day and to tell her\neverything, and ask her whether she could and would be his wife.\nAlthough that question had long been answered in the negative in his\nown mind, he hoped he would be able to tell her all he felt, and that\nshe would understand him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you not tell me sooner?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bel\xc3\xa9tski. \xe2\x80\x9cI would have got\n\xc3\x9astenka to arrange it for you. You are such a queer fellow! ...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s to be done! ... Some day, very soon, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you all about\nit. Only now, for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, arrange so that she should come to\n\xc3\x9astenka\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, that\xe2\x80\x99s easily done! Well, Mary\xc3\xa1nka, will you belong to the\n\xe2\x80\x98fair-faced lad\xe2\x80\x99, and not to Luk\xc3\xa1shka?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bel\xc3\xa9tski, speaking to\nMary\xc3\xa1nka first for propriety\xe2\x80\x99s sake, but having received no reply he\nwent up to \xc3\x9astenka and begged her to bring Mary\xc3\xa1nka home with her. He\nhad hardly time to finish what he was saying before the leader began\nanother song and the girls started pulling each other round in the ring\nby the hand.\n\nThey sang:\n\nPast the garden, by the garden,\nA young man came strolling down,\nUp the street and through the town.\nAnd the first time as he passed\nHe did wave his strong right hand.\nAs the second time he passed\nWaved his hat with silken band.\nBut the third time as he went\nHe stood still: before her bent.\n\nHow is it that thou, my dear,\nMy reproaches dost not fear?\nIn the park don\xe2\x80\x99t come to walk\nThat we there might have a talk?\nCome now, answer me, my dear,\nDost thou hold me in contempt?\nLater on, thou knowest, dear,\nThou\xe2\x80\x99lt get sober and repent.\nSoon to woo thee I will come,\nAnd when we shall married be\nThou wilt weep because of me!\n\nThough I knew what to reply,\nYet I dared not him deny,\nNo, I dared not him deny!\nSo into the park went I,\nIn the park my lad to meet,\nThere my dear one I did greet.\n\nMaiden dear, I bow to thee!\nTake this handkerchief from me.\nIn thy white hand take it, see!\nSay I am beloved by thee.\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know at all, I fear,\nWhat I am to give thee, dear!\nTo my dear I think I will\nOf a shawl a present make\xe2\x80\x94\nAnd five kisses for it take.\n\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka and Naz\xc3\xa1rka broke into the ring and started walking about\namong the girls. Luk\xc3\xa1shka joined in the singing, taking seconds in his\nclear voice as he walked in the middle of the ring swinging his arms.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, come in, one of you!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. The other girls pushed Mary\xc3\xa1nka,\nbut she would not enter the ring. The sound of shrill laughter, slaps,\nkisses, and whispers mingled with the singing.\n\nAs he went past Ol\xc3\xa9nin, Luk\xc3\xa1shka gave a friendly nod.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDm\xc3\xadtri Andr\xc3\xa9ich! Have you too come to have a look?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ol\xc3\xa9nin dryly.\n\nBel\xc3\xa9tski stooped and whispered something into \xc3\x9astenka\xe2\x80\x99s ear. She had\nnot time to reply till she came round again, when she said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, we\xe2\x80\x99ll come.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mary\xc3\xa1nka too?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin stooped towards Mary\xc3\xa1nka. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll come? Please do, if only for a\nminute. I must speak to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the other girls come, I will.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you answer my question?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, bending towards her. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\nin good spirits today.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe had already moved past him. He went after her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you answer?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnswer what?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe question I asked you the other day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin, stooping to her\near. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you marry me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka thought for a moment.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd through the darkness her eyes gleamed brightly and kindly at the\nyoung man.\n\nHe still followed her. He enjoyed stooping closer to her. But Luk\xc3\xa1shka,\nwithout ceasing to sing, suddenly seized her firmly by the hand and\npulled her from her place in the ring of girls into the middle. Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nhad only time to say, \xe2\x80\x9cCome to \xc3\x9astenka\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d and stepped back to his\ncompanion.\n\nThe song came to an end. Luk\xc3\xa1shka wiped his lips, Mary\xc3\xa1nka did the\nsame, and they kissed. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, kisses five!\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka. Chatter,\nlaughter, and running about, succeeded to the rhythmic movements and\nsound. Luk\xc3\xa1shka, who seemed to have drunk a great deal, began to\ndistribute sweetmeats to the girls.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI offer them to everyone!\xe2\x80\x9d he said with proud, comically pathetic\nself-admiration. \xe2\x80\x9cBut anyone who goes after soldiers goes out of the\nring!\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly added, with an angry glance at Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\nThe girls grabbed his sweetmeats from him, and, laughing, struggled for\nthem among themselves. Bel\xc3\xa9tski and Ol\xc3\xa9nin stepped aside.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka, as if ashamed of his generosity, took off his cap and wiping\nhis forehead with his sleeve came up to Mary\xc3\xa1nka and \xc3\x9astenka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnswer me, my dear, dost thou hold me in contempt?\xe2\x80\x9d he said in the\nwords of the song they had just been singing, and turning to Mary\xc3\xa1nka\nhe angrily repeated the words: \xe2\x80\x9cDost thou hold me in contempt? When we\nshall married be thou wilt weep because of me!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, embracing\n\xc3\x9astenka and Mary\xc3\xa1nka both together.\n\n\xc3\x9astenka tore herself away, and swinging her arm gave him such a blow on\nthe back that she hurt her hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, are you going to have another turn?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe other girls may if they like,\xe2\x80\x9d answered \xc3\x9astenka, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am going\nhome and Mary\xc3\xa1nka was coming to our house too.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWith his arm still round her, Luk\xc3\xa1shka led Mary\xc3\xa1nka away from the crowd\nto the darker corner of a house.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go, Mary\xc3\xa1nka,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9clet\xe2\x80\x99s have some fun for the last time.\nGo home and I will come to you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I to do at home? Holidays are meant for merrymaking. I am\ngoing to \xc3\x9astenka\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mary\xc3\xa1nka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll marry you all the same, you know!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary\xc3\xa1nka, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall see when the time comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you are going,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka sternly, and, pressing her close, he\nkissed her on the cheek.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, leave off! Don\xe2\x80\x99t bother,\xe2\x80\x9d and Mary\xc3\xa1nka, wrenching herself from\nhis arms, moved away.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh my girl, it will turn out badly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka reproachfully and\nstood still, shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x9cThou wilt weep because of me...\xe2\x80\x9d and\nturning away from her he shouted to the other girls:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then! Play away!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhat he had said seemed to have frightened and vexed Mary\xc3\xa1nka. She\nstopped, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat will turn out badly?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat what?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that you keep company with a soldier-lodger and no longer care\nfor me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll care just as long as I choose. You\xe2\x80\x99re not my father, nor my\nmother. What do you want? I\xe2\x80\x99ll care for whom I like!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, all right...\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, \xe2\x80\x9cbut remember!\xe2\x80\x9d He moved towards\nthe shop. \xe2\x80\x9cGirls!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy have you stopped? Go on dancing.\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka, fetch some more _chikhir_.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, will they come?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin, addressing Bel\xc3\xa9tski.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll come directly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Bel\xc3\xa9tski. \xe2\x80\x9cCome along, we must prepare\nthe ball.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXXIX\n\n\nIt was already late in the night when Ol\xc3\xa9nin came out of Bel\xc3\xa9tski\xe2\x80\x99s hut\nfollowing Mary\xc3\xa1nka and \xc3\x9astenka. He saw in the dark street before him\nthe gleam of the girl\xe2\x80\x99s white kerchief. The golden moon was descending\ntowards the steppe. A silvery mist hung over the village. All was\nstill; there were no lights anywhere and one heard only the receding\nfootsteps of the young women. Ol\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s heart beat fast. The fresh moist\natmosphere cooled his burning face. He glanced at the sky and turned to\nlook at the hut he had just come out of: the candle was already out.\nThen he again peered through the darkness at the girls\xe2\x80\x99 retreating\nshadows. The white kerchief disappeared in the mist. He was afraid to\nremain alone, he was so happy. He jumped down from the porch and ran\nafter the girls.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBother you, someone may see...\xe2\x80\x9d said \xc3\x9astenka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin ran up to Mary\xc3\xa1nka and embraced her.\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka did not resist.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you kissed enough yet?\xe2\x80\x9d said \xc3\x9astenka. \xe2\x80\x9cMarry and then kiss,\nbut now you\xe2\x80\x99d better wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, Mary\xc3\xa1nka. Tomorrow I will come to see your father and tell\nhim. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you say anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mary\xc3\xa1nka.\n\nBoth the girls started running. Ol\xc3\xa9nin went on by himself thinking over\nall that had happened. He had spent the whole evening alone with her in\na corner by the oven. \xc3\x9astenka had not left the hut for a single moment,\nbut had romped about with the other girls and with Bel\xc3\xa9tski all the\ntime. Ol\xc3\xa9nin had talked in whispers to Mary\xc3\xa1nka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you marry me?\xe2\x80\x9d he had asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d deceive me and not have me,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied cheerfully and calmly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut do you love me? Tell me for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I love you? You don\xe2\x80\x99t squint,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mary\xc3\xa1nka,\nlaughing and with her hard hands squeezing his....\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat whi-ite, whi-i-ite, soft hands you\xe2\x80\x99ve got\xe2\x80\x94so like clotted cream,\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am in earnest. Tell me, will you marry me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not, if father gives me to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then remember, I shall go mad if you deceive me. Tomorrow I will\ntell your mother and father. I shall come and propose.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka suddenly burst out laughing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems so funny!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s true! I will buy a vineyard and a house and will enroll myself as\na Cossack.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind you don\xe2\x80\x99t go after other women then. I am severe about that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin joyfully repeated all these words to himself. The memory of them\nnow gave him pain and now such joy that it took away his breath. The\npain was because she had remained as calm as usual while talking to\nhim. She did not seem at all agitated by these new conditions. It was\nas if she did not trust him and did not think of the future. It seemed\nto him that she only loved him for the present moment, and that in her\nmind there was no future with him. He was happy because her words\nsounded to him true, and she had consented to be his. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he\nto himself, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall only understand one another when she is quite\nmine. For such love there are no words. It needs life\xe2\x80\x94the whole of\nlife. Tomorrow everything will be cleared up. I cannot live like this\nany longer; tomorrow I will tell everything to her father, to Bel\xc3\xa9tski,\nand to the whole village.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka, after two sleepless nights, had drunk so much at the f\xc3\xaate\nthat for the first time in his life his feet would not carry him, and\nhe slept in Y\xc3\xa1mka\xe2\x80\x99s house.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XL\n\n\nThe next day Ol\xc3\xa9nin awoke earlier than usual, and immediately\nremembered what lay before him, and he joyfully recalled her kisses,\nthe pressure of her hard hands, and her words, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat white hands you\nhave!\xe2\x80\x9d He jumped up and wished to go at once to his hosts\xe2\x80\x99 hut to ask\nfor their consent to his marriage with Mary\xc3\xa1nka. The sun had not yet\nrisen, but it seemed that there was an unusual bustle in the street and\nside-street: people were moving about on foot and on horseback, and\ntalking. He threw on his Circassian coat and hastened out into the\nporch. His hosts were not yet up. Five Cossacks were riding past and\ntalking loudly together. In front rode Luk\xc3\xa1shka on his broad-backed\nKabard\xc3\xa1 horse.\n\nThe Cossacks were all speaking and shouting so that it was impossible\nto make out exactly what they were saying.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRide to the Upper Post,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted one.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaddle and catch us up, be quick,\xe2\x80\x9d said another.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nearer through the other gate!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Luk\xc3\xa1shka. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must go through the\nmiddle gates, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo we must, it\xe2\x80\x99s nearer that way,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the Cossacks who was\ncovered with dust and rode a perspiring horse. Luk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s face was red\nand swollen after the drinking of the previous night and his cap was\npushed to the back of his head. He was calling out with authority as\nthough he were an officer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter? Where are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin, with\ndifficulty attracting the Cossacks\xe2\x80\x99 attention.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are off to catch _abreks_. They\xe2\x80\x99re hiding among the sand-drifts. We\nare just off, but there are not enough of us yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the Cossacks continued to shout, more and more of them joining as\nthey rode down the street. It occurred to Ol\xc3\xa9nin that it would not look\nwell for him to stay behind; besides he thought he could soon come\nback. He dressed, loaded his gun with bullets, jumped onto his horse\nwhich Vany\xc3\xbasha had saddled more or less well, and overtook the Cossacks\nat the village gates. The Cossacks had dismounted, and filling a wooden\nbowl with _chikhir_ from a little cask which they had brought with\nthem, they passed the bowl round to one another and drank to the\nsuccess of their expedition. Among them was a smartly dressed young\ncornet, who happened to be in the village and who took command of the\ngroup of nine Cossacks who had joined for the expedition. All these\nCossacks were privates, and although the cornet assumed the airs of a\ncommanding officer, they only obeyed Luk\xc3\xa1shka. Of Ol\xc3\xa9nin they took no\nnotice at all, and when they had all mounted and started, and Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nrode up to the cornet and began asking him what was taking place, the\ncornet, who was usually quite friendly, treated him with marked\ncondescension. It was with great difficulty that Ol\xc3\xa9nin managed to find\nout from him what was happening. Scouts who had been sent out to search\nfor _abreks_ had come upon several hillsmen some six miles from the\nvillage. These _abreks_ had taken shelter in pits and had fired at the\nscouts, declaring they would not surrender. A corporal who had been\nscouting with two Cossacks had remained to watch the _abreks_, and had\nsent one Cossack back to get help.\n\nThe sun was just rising. Three miles beyond the village the steppe\nspread out and nothing was visible except the dry, monotonous, sandy,\ndismal plain covered with the footmarks of cattle, and here and there\nwith tufts of withered grass, with low reeds in the flats, and rare,\nlittle-trodden footpaths, and the camps of the nomad Nog\xc3\xa1y tribe just\nvisible far away. The absence of shade and the austere aspect of the\nplace were striking. The sun always rises and sets red in the steppe.\nWhen it is windy whole hills of sand are carried by the wind from place\nto place.\n\nWhen it is calm, as it was that morning, the silence, uninterrupted by\nany movement or sound, is peculiarly striking. That morning in the\nsteppe it was quiet and dull, though the sun had already risen. It all\nseemed specially soft and desolate. The air was hushed, the footfalls\nand the snorting of the horses were the only sounds to be heard, and\neven they quickly died away.\n\nThe men rode almost silently. A Cossack always carries his weapons so\nthat they neither jingle nor rattle. Jingling weapons are a terrible\ndisgrace to a Cossack. Two other Cossacks from the village caught the\nparty up and exchanged a few words. Luk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s horse either stumbled or\ncaught its foot in some grass, and became restive\xe2\x80\x94which is a sign of\nbad luck among the Cossacks, and at such a time was of special\nimportance. The others exchanged glances and turned away, trying not to\nnotice what had happened. Lukaskha pulled at the reins, frowned\nsternly, set his teeth, and flourished his whip above his head. His\ngood Kabard\xc3\xa1 horse, prancing from one foot to another not knowing with\nwhich to start, seemed to wish to fly upwards on wings. But Luk\xc3\xa1shka\nhit its well-fed sides with his whip once, then again, and a third\ntime, and the horse, showing its teeth and spreading out its tail,\nsnorted and reared and stepped on its hind legs a few paces away from\nthe others.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, a good steed that!\xe2\x80\x9d said the cornet.\n\nThat he said _steed_ instead of _horse_ indicated special praise.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lion of a horse,\xe2\x80\x9d assented one of the others, an old Cossack.\n\nThe Cossacks rode forward silently, now at a footpace, then at a trot,\nand these changes were the only incidents that interrupted for a moment\nthe stillness and solemnity of their movements.\n\nRiding through the steppe for about six miles, they passed nothing but\none Nog\xc3\xa1y tent, placed on a cart and moving slowly along at a distance\nof about a mile from them. A Nog\xc3\xa1y family was moving from one part of\nthe steppe to another. Afterwards they met two tattered Nog\xc3\xa1y women\nwith high cheekbones, who with baskets on their backs were gathering\ndung left by the cattle that wandered over the steppe. The cornet, who\ndid not know their language well, tried to question them, but they did\nnot understand him and, obviously frightened, looked at one another.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka rode up to them both, stopped his horse, and promptly uttered\nthe usual greeting. The Nog\xc3\xa1y women were evidently relieved, and began\nspeaking to him quite freely as to a brother.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Ay-ay, kop abrek!_\xe2\x80\x9d they said plaintively, pointing in the direction\nin which the Cossacks were going. Ol\xc3\xa9nin understood that they were\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cMany _abreks_.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNever having seen an engagement of that kind, and having formed an idea\nof them only from Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka\xe2\x80\x99s tales, Ol\xc3\xa9nin wished not to be left\nbehind by the Cossacks, but wanted to see it all. He admired the\nCossacks, and was on the watch, looking and listening and making his\nown observations. Though he had brought his sword and a loaded gun with\nhim, when he noticed that the Cossacks avoided him he decided to take\nno part in the action, as in his opinion his courage had already been\nsufficiently proved when he was with his detachment, and also because\nhe was very happy.\n\nSuddenly a shot was heard in the distance.\n\nThe cornet became excited, and began giving orders to the Cossacks as\nto how they should divide and from which side they should approach. But\nthe Cossacks did not appear to pay any attention to these orders,\nlistening only to what Luk\xc3\xa1shka said and looking to him alone.\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s face and figure were expressive of calm solemnity. He put\nhis horse to a trot with which the others were unable to keep pace, and\nscrewing up his eyes kept looking ahead.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a man on horseback,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, reining in his horse and keeping\nin line with the others.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin looked intently, but could not see anything. The Cossacks soon\ndistinguished two riders and quietly rode straight towards them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre those the _abreks?_\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\nThe Cossacks did not answer his question, which appeared quite\nmeaningless to them. The _abreks_ would have been fools to venture\nacross the river on horseback.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s friend R\xc3\xb3dka waving to us, I do believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka,\npointing to the two mounted men who were now clearly visible. \xe2\x80\x9cLook,\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s coming to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA few minutes later it became plain that the two horsemen were the\nCossack scouts. The corporal rode up to Luk\xc3\xa1shka.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XLI\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre they far?\xe2\x80\x9d was all Luk\xc3\xa1shka said.\n\nJust then they heard a sharp shot some thirty paces off. The corporal\nsmiled slightly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur G\xc3\xbarka is having shots at them,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, nodding in the direction\nof the shot.\n\nHaving gone a few paces farther they saw G\xc3\xbarka sitting behind a\nsand-hillock and loading his gun. To while away the time he was\nexchanging shots with the _abreks_, who were behind another sand-heap.\nA bullet came whistling from their side.\n\nThe cornet was pale and grew confused. Luk\xc3\xa1shka dismounted from his\nhorse, threw the reins to one of the other Cossacks, and went up to\nG\xc3\xbarka. Ol\xc3\xa9nin also dismounted and, bending down, followed Luk\xc3\xa1shka.\nThey had hardly reached G\xc3\xbarka when two bullets whistled above them.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka looked around laughing at Ol\xc3\xa9nin and stooped a little.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook out or they will kill you, Dm\xc3\xadtri Andr\xc3\xa9ich,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d\nbetter go away\xe2\x80\x94you have no business here.\xe2\x80\x9d But Ol\xc3\xa9nin wanted absolutely\nto see the _abreks_.\n\nFrom behind the mound he saw caps and muskets some two hundred paces\noff. Suddenly a little cloud of smoke appeared from thence, and again a\nbullet whistled past. The _abreks_ were hiding in a marsh at the foot\nof the hill. Ol\xc3\xa9nin was much impressed by the place in which they sat.\nIn reality it was very much like the rest of the steppe, but because\nthe _abreks_ sat there it seemed to detach itself from all the rest and\nto have become distinguished. Indeed it appeared to Ol\xc3\xa9nin that it was\nthe very spot for _abreks_ to occupy. Luk\xc3\xa1shka went back to his horse\nand Ol\xc3\xa9nin followed him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must get a hay-cart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, \xe2\x80\x9cor they will be killing some\nof us. There behind that mound is a Nog\xc3\xa1y cart with a load of hay.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe cornet listened to him and the corporal agreed. The cart of hay was\nfetched, and the Cossacks, hiding behind it, pushed it forward. Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nrode up a hillock from whence he could see everything. The hay-cart\nmoved on and the Cossacks crowded together behind it. The Cossacks\nadvanced, but the Ch\xc3\xa9chens, of whom there were nine, sat with their\nknees in a row and did not fire.\n\nAll was quiet. Suddenly from the Ch\xc3\xa9chens arose the sound of a mournful\nsong, something like Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cAy day, dalalay.\xe2\x80\x9d The Ch\xc3\xa9chens\nknew that they could not escape, and to prevent themselves from being\ntempted to take to flight they had strapped themselves together, knee\nto knee, had got their guns ready, and were singing their death-song.\n\nThe Cossacks with their hay-cart drew closer and closer, and Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nexpected the firing to begin at any moment, but the silence was only\nbroken by the _abreks_\xe2\x80\x99 mournful song. Suddenly the song ceased; there\nwas a sharp report, a bullet struck the front of the cart, and Ch\xc3\xa9chen\ncurses and yells broke the silence and shot followed on shot and one\nbullet after another struck the cart. The Cossacks did not fire and\nwere now only five paces distant.\n\nAnother moment passed and the Cossacks with a whoop rushed out on both\nsides from behind the cart\xe2\x80\x94Luk\xc3\xa1shka in front of them. Ol\xc3\xa9nin heard only\na few shots, then shouting and moans. He thought he saw smoke and\nblood, and abandoning his horse and quite beside himself he ran towards\nthe Cossacks. Horror seemed to blind him. He could not make out\nanything, but understood that all was over. Luk\xc3\xa1shka, pale as death,\nwas holding a wounded Ch\xc3\xa9chen by the arms and shouting, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t kill\nhim. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take him alive!\xe2\x80\x9d The Ch\xc3\xa9chen was the red-haired man who had\nfetched his brother\xe2\x80\x99s body away after Luk\xc3\xa1shka had killed him. Luk\xc3\xa1shka\nwas twisting his arms. Suddenly the Ch\xc3\xa9chen wrenched himself free and\nfired his pistol. Luk\xc3\xa1shka fell, and blood began to flow from his\nstomach. He jumped up, but fell again, swearing in Russian and in\nTartar. More and more blood appeared on his clothes and under him. Some\nCossacks approached him and began loosening his girdle. One of them,\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka, before beginning to help, fumbled for some time, unable to put\nhis sword in its sheath: it would not go the right way. The blade of\nthe sword was blood-stained.\n\nThe Ch\xc3\xa9chens with their red hair and clipped moustaches lay dead and\nhacked about. Only the one we know of, who had fired at Luk\xc3\xa1shka,\nthough wounded in many places was still alive. Like a wounded hawk all\ncovered with blood (blood was flowing from a wound under his right\neye), pale and gloomy, he looked about him with wide-open excited eyes\nand clenched teeth as he crouched, dagger in hand, still prepared to\ndefend himself. The cornet went up to him as if intending to pass by,\nand with a quick movement shot him in the ear. The Ch\xc3\xa9chen started up,\nbut it was too late, and he fell.\n\nThe Cossacks, quite out of breath, dragged the bodies aside and took\nthe weapons from them. Each of the red-haired Ch\xc3\xa9chens had been a man,\nand each one had his own individual expression. Luk\xc3\xa1shka was carried to\nthe cart. He continued to swear in Russian and in Tartar.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo fear, I\xe2\x80\x99ll strangle him with my hands. _Anna seni!_\xe2\x80\x9d he cried,\nstruggling. But he soon became quiet from weakness.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin rode home. In the evening he was told that Luk\xc3\xa1shka was at\ndeath\xe2\x80\x99s door, but that a Tartar from beyond the river had undertaken to\ncure him with herbs.\n\nThe bodies were brought to the village office. The women and the little\nboys hastened to look at them.\n\nIt was growing dark when Ol\xc3\xa9nin returned, and he could not collect\nhimself after what he had seen. But towards night memories of the\nevening before came rushing to his mind. He looked out of the window,\nMary\xc3\xa1nka was passing to and fro from the house to the cowshed, putting\nthings straight. Her mother had gone to the vineyard and her father to\nthe office. Ol\xc3\xa9nin could not wait till she had quite finished her work,\nbut went out to meet her. She was in the hut standing with her back\ntowards him. Ol\xc3\xa9nin thought she felt shy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary\xc3\xa1nka,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI say, Mary\xc3\xa1nka! May I come in?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe suddenly turned. There was a scarcely perceptible trace of tears in\nher eyes and her face was beautiful in its sadness. She looked at him\nin silent dignity.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin again said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary\xc3\xa1nka, I have come\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave me alone!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Her face did not change but the tears ran\ndown her cheeks.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you crying for? What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated in a rough voice. \xe2\x80\x9cCossacks have been killed,\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s what for.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLuk\xc3\xa1shka?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo away! What do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary\xc3\xa1nka!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin, approaching her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will never get anything from me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary\xc3\xa1nka, don\xe2\x80\x99t speak like that,\xe2\x80\x9d Ol\xc3\xa9nin entreated.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet away. I\xe2\x80\x99m sick of you!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the girl, stamping her foot, and\nmoved threateningly towards him. And her face expressed such\nabhorrence, such contempt, and such anger that Ol\xc3\xa9nin suddenly\nunderstood that there was no hope for him, and that his first\nimpression of this woman\xe2\x80\x99s inaccessibility had been perfectly correct.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin said nothing more, but ran out of the hut.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XLII\n\n\nFor two hours after returning home he lay on his bed motionless. Then\nhe went to his company commander and obtained leave to visit the staff.\nWithout taking leave of anyone, and sending Vany\xc3\xbasha to settle his\naccounts with his landlord, he prepared to leave for the fort where his\nregiment was stationed. Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka was the only one to see him off.\nThey had a drink, and then a second, and then yet another. Again as on\nthe night of his departure from Moscow, a three-horsed conveyance stood\nwaiting at the door. But Ol\xc3\xa9nin did not confer with himself as he had\ndone then, and did not say to himself that all he had thought and done\nhere was \xe2\x80\x9cnot it\xe2\x80\x9d. He did not promise himself a new life. He loved\nMary\xc3\xa1nka more than ever, and knew that he could never be loved by her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-bye, my lad!\xe2\x80\x9d said Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you go on an\nexpedition, be wise and listen to my words\xe2\x80\x94the words of an old man.\nWhen you are out on a raid or the like (you know I\xe2\x80\x99m an old wolf and\nhave seen things), and when they begin firing, don\xe2\x80\x99t get into a crowd\nwhere there are many men. When you fellows get frightened you always\ntry to get close together with a lot of others. You think it is merrier\nto be with others, but that\xe2\x80\x99s where it is worst of all! They always aim\nat a crowd. Now I used to keep farther away from the others and went\nalone, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been wounded. Yet what things haven\xe2\x80\x99t I seen in\nmy day?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a bullet in your back,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Vany\xc3\xbasha, who was\nclearing up the room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was the Cossacks fooling about,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Er\xc3\xb3shka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCossacks? How was that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, just so. We were drinking. V\xc3\xa1nka S\xc3\xadtkin, one of the Cossacks, got\nmerry, and puff! he gave me one from his pistol just here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and did it hurt?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin. \xe2\x80\x9cVany\xc3\xbasha, will you soon be\nready?\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, where\xe2\x80\x99s the hurry! Let me tell you. When he banged into me, the\nbullet did not break the bone but remained here. And I say: \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ve\nkilled me, brother. Eh! What have you done to me? I won\xe2\x80\x99t let you off!\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to stand me a pailful!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but did it hurt?\xe2\x80\x9d Ol\xc3\xa9nin asked again, scarcely listening to the\ntale.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me finish. He stood a pailful, and we drank it, but the blood went\non flowing. The whole room was drenched and covered with blood. Grandad\nBurl\xc3\xa1k, he says, \xe2\x80\x98The lad will give up the ghost. Stand a bottle of the\nsweet sort, or we shall have you taken up!\xe2\x80\x99 They bought more drink, and\nboozed and boozed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but did it hurt you much?\xe2\x80\x9d Ol\xc3\xa9nin asked once more.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurt, indeed! Don\xe2\x80\x99t interrupt: I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it. Let me finish. We\nboozed and boozed till morning, and I fell asleep on the top of the\noven, drunk. When I woke in the morning I could not unbend myself\nanyhow\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it very painful?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Ol\xc3\xa9nin, thinking that now he would at\nlast get an answer to his question.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I tell you it was painful? I did not say it was painful, but I\ncould not bend and could not walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then it healed up?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin, not even laughing, so heavy was\nhis heart.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt healed up, but the bullet is still there. Just feel it!\xe2\x80\x9d And\nlifting his shirt he showed his powerful back, where just near the bone\na bullet could be felt and rolled about.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFeel how it rolls,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, evidently amusing himself with the bullet\nas with a toy. \xe2\x80\x9cThere now, it has rolled to the back.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Luk\xc3\xa1shka, will he recover?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven only knows! There\xe2\x80\x99s no doctor. They\xe2\x80\x99ve gone for one.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere will they get one? From Gr\xc3\xb3znoe?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my lad. Were I the Tsar I\xe2\x80\x99d have hung all your Russian doctors\nlong ago. Cutting is all they know! There\xe2\x80\x99s our Cossack Bakl\xc3\xa1shka, no\nlonger a real man now that they\xe2\x80\x99ve cut off his leg! That shows they\xe2\x80\x99re\nfools. What\xe2\x80\x99s Bakl\xc3\xa1shka good for now? No, my lad, in the mountains\nthere are real doctors. There was my chum, V\xc3\xb3rchik, he was on an\nexpedition and was wounded just here in the chest. Well, your doctors\ngave him up, but one of theirs came from the mountains and cured him!\nThey understand herbs, my lad!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, stop talking rubbish,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d better send a doctor\nfrom head-quarters.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRubbish!\xe2\x80\x9d the old man said mockingly. \xe2\x80\x9cFool, fool! Rubbish. You\xe2\x80\x99ll\nsend a doctor!\xe2\x80\x94If yours cured people, Cossacks and Ch\xc3\xa9chens would go to\nyou for treatment, but as it is your officers and colonels send to the\nmountains for doctors. Yours are all humbugs, all humbugs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin did not answer. He agreed only too fully that all was humbug in\nthe world in which he had lived and to which he was now returning.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is Luk\xc3\xa1shka? You\xe2\x80\x99ve been to see him?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe just lies as if he were dead. He does not eat nor drink. Vodka is\nthe only thing his soul accepts. But as long as he drinks vodka it\xe2\x80\x99s\nwell. I\xe2\x80\x99d be sorry to lose the lad. A fine lad\xe2\x80\x94a brave, like me. I too\nlay dying like that once. The old women were already wailing. My head\nwas burning. They had already laid me out under the holy icons. So I\nlay there, and above me on the oven little drummers, no bigger than\nthis, beat the tattoo. I shout at them and they drum all the harder.\xe2\x80\x9d\n(The old man laughed.) \xe2\x80\x9cThe women brought our church elder. They were\ngetting ready to bury me. They said, \xe2\x80\x98He defiled himself with worldly\nunbelievers; he made merry with women; he ruined people; he did not\nfast, and he played the _balal\xc3\xa1yka_. Confess,\xe2\x80\x99 they said. So I began to\nconfess. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve sinned!\xe2\x80\x99 I said. Whatever the priest said, I always\nanswered \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve sinned.\xe2\x80\x99 He began to ask me about the _balal\xc3\xa1yka_.\n\xe2\x80\x98Where is the accursed thing,\xe2\x80\x99 he says. \xe2\x80\x98Show it me and smash it.\xe2\x80\x99 But\nI say, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve not got it.\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99d hidden it myself in a net in the\nouthouse. I knew they could not find it. So they left me. Yet after all\nI recovered. When I went for my _balal\xc3\xa1yka_\xe2\x80\x94What was I saying?\xe2\x80\x9d he\ncontinued. \xe2\x80\x9cListen to me, and keep farther away from the other men or\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll get killed foolishly. I feel for you, truly: you are a drinker\xe2\x80\x94I\nlove you! And fellows like you like riding up the mounds. There was one\nwho lived here who had come from Russia, he always would ride up the\nmounds (he called the mounds so funnily, \xe2\x80\x98hillocks\xe2\x80\x99). Whenever he saw a\nmound, off he\xe2\x80\x99d gallop. Once he galloped off that way and rode to the\ntop quite pleased, but a Ch\xc3\xa9chen fired at him and killed him! Ah, how\nwell they shoot from their gun-rests, those Ch\xc3\xa9chens! Some of them\nshoot even better than I do. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it when a fellow gets killed\nso foolishly! Sometimes I used to look at your soldiers and wonder at\nthem. There\xe2\x80\x99s foolishness for you! They go, the poor fellows, all in a\nclump, and even sew red collars to their coats! How can they help being\nhit! One gets killed, they drag him away and another takes his place!\nWhat foolishness!\xe2\x80\x9d the old man repeated, shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not\nscatter, and go one by one? So you just go like that and they won\xe2\x80\x99t\nnotice you. That\xe2\x80\x99s what you must do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, thank you! Good-bye, Daddy. God willing we may meet again,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nOl\xc3\xa9nin, getting up and moving towards the passage.\n\nThe old man, who was sitting on the floor, did not rise.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that the way one says \xe2\x80\x98Good-bye\xe2\x80\x99? Fool, fool!\xe2\x80\x9d he began. \xe2\x80\x9cOh dear,\nwhat has come to people? We\xe2\x80\x99ve kept company, kept company for well-nigh\na year, and now \xe2\x80\x98Good-bye!\xe2\x80\x99 and off he goes! Why, I love you, and how I\npity you! You are so forlorn, always alone, always alone. You\xe2\x80\x99re\nsomehow so unsociable. At times I can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep for thinking about you. I\nam so sorry for you. As the song has it:\n\nIt is very hard, dear brother,\nIn a foreign land to live.\n\n\nSo it is with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin again.\n\nThe old man rose and held out his hand. Ol\xc3\xa9nin pressed it and turned to\ngo.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive us your mug, your mug!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the old man took Ol\xc3\xa9nin by the head with both hands and kissed him\nthree times with wet moustaches and lips, and began to cry.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love you, good-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin got into the cart.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, is that how you\xe2\x80\x99re going? You might give me something for a\nremembrance. Give me a gun! What do you want two for?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old\nman, sobbing quite sincerely.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin got out a musket and gave it to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a lot you\xe2\x80\x99ve given the old fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Vany\xc3\xbasha, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99ll\nnever have enough! A regular old beggar. They are all such irregular\npeople,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, as he wrapped himself in his overcoat and took\nhis seat on the box.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue, swine!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the old man, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a\nstingy fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka came out of the cowshed, glanced indifferently at the cart,\nbowed and went towards the hut.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_La fille!_\xe2\x80\x9d said Vany\xc3\xbasha, with a wink, and burst out into a silly\nlaugh.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrive on!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Ol\xc3\xa9nin, angrily.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, my lad! Good-bye. I won\xe2\x80\x99t forget you!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Er\xc3\xb3shka.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin turned round. Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka was talking to Mary\xc3\xa1nka, evidently\nabout his own affairs, and neither the old man nor the girl looked at\nOl\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\n\n'b'\n\n\n\nTHE COSSACKS\n\nA Tale of 1852\n\nBy Leo Tolstoy\n\n\nTranslated by Louise and Aylmer Maude\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n Chapter I\n Chapter II\n Chapter III\n Chapter IV\n Chapter V\n Chapter VI\n Chapter VII\n Chapter VIII\n Chapter IX\n Chapter X\n Chapter XI\n Chapter XII\n Chapter XIII\n Chapter XIV\n Chapter XV\n Chapter XVI\n Chapter XVII\n Chapter XVIII\n Chapter XIX\n Chapter XX\n Chapter XXI\n Chapter XXII\n Chapter XXIII\n Chapter XXIV\n Chapter XXV\n Chapter XXVI\n Chapter XXVII\n Chapter XXVIII\n Chapter XXIX\n Chapter XXX\n Chapter XXXI\n Chapter XXXII\n Chapter XXXIII\n Chapter XXXIV\n Chapter XXXV\n Chapter XXXVI\n Chapter XXXVII\n Chapter XXXVIII\n Chapter XXXIX\n Chapter XL\n Chapter XLI\n Chapter XLII\n\n\n\n\nChapter I\n\n\nAll is quiet in Moscow. The squeak of wheels is seldom heard in the\nsnow-covered street. There are no lights left in the windows and the\nstreet lamps have been extinguished. Only the sound of bells, borne\nover the city from the church towers, suggests the approach of morning.\nThe streets are deserted. At rare intervals a night-cabman\xe2\x80\x99s sledge\nkneads up the snow and sand in the street as the driver makes his way\nto another corner where he falls asleep while waiting for a fare. An\nold woman passes by on her way to church, where a few wax candles burn\nwith a red light reflected on the gilt mountings of the icons. Workmen\nare already getting up after the long winter night and going to their\nwork\xe2\x80\x94but for the gentlefolk it is still evening.\n\nFrom a window in Chevalier\xe2\x80\x99s Restaurant a light\xe2\x80\x94illegal at that hour\xe2\x80\x94is\nstill to be seen through a chink in the shutter. At the entrance a\ncarriage, a sledge, and a cabman\xe2\x80\x99s sledge, stand close together with\ntheir backs to the curbstone. A three-horse sledge from the\npost-station is there also. A yard-porter muffled up and pinched with\ncold is sheltering behind the corner of the house.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s the good of all this jawing?\xe2\x80\x9d thinks the footman who sits\nin the hall weary and haggard. \xe2\x80\x9cThis always happens when I\xe2\x80\x99m on duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFrom the adjoining room are heard the voices of three young men,\nsitting there at a table on which are wine and the remains of supper.\nOne, a rather plain, thin, neat little man, sits looking with tired\nkindly eyes at his friend, who is about to start on a journey. Another,\na tall man, lies on a sofa beside a table on which are empty bottles,\nand plays with his watch-key. A third, wearing a short, fur-lined coat,\nis pacing up and down the room stopping now and then to crack an almond\nbetween his strong, rather thick, but well-tended fingers. He keeps\nsmiling at something and his face and eyes are all aglow. He speaks\nwarmly and gesticulates, but evidently does not find the words he wants\nand those that occur to him seem to him inadequate to express what has\nrisen to his heart.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I can speak out fully,\xe2\x80\x9d said the traveller. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\ndefend myself, but I should like you at least to understand me as I\nunderstand myself, and not look at the matter superficially. You say I\nhave treated her badly,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, addressing the man with the\nkindly eyes who was watching him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you are to blame,\xe2\x80\x9d said the latter, and his look seemed to\nexpress still more kindliness and weariness.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know why you say that,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the one who was leaving. \xe2\x80\x9cTo be\nloved is in your opinion as great a happiness as to love, and if a man\nobtains it, it is enough for his whole life.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, quite enough, my dear fellow, more than enough!\xe2\x80\x9d confirmed the\nplain little man, opening and shutting his eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the man love too?\xe2\x80\x9d said the traveller thoughtfully,\nlooking at his friend with something like pity. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t one\nlove? Because love doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come ... No, to be beloved is a misfortune.\nIt is a misfortune to feel guilty because you do not give something you\ncannot give. O my God!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with a gesture of his arm. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it all\nhappened reasonably, and not all topsy-turvy\xe2\x80\x94not in our way but in a\nway of its own! Why, it\xe2\x80\x99s as if I had stolen that love! You think so\ntoo, don\xe2\x80\x99t deny it. You must think so. But will you believe it, of all\nthe horrid and stupid things I have found time to do in my life\xe2\x80\x94and\nthere are many\xe2\x80\x94this is one I do not and cannot repent of. Neither at\nthe beginning nor afterwards did I lie to myself or to her. It seemed\nto me that I had at last fallen in love, but then I saw that it was an\ninvoluntary falsehood, and that that was not the way to love, and I\ncould not go on, but she did. Am I to blame that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t? What was I\nto do?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s ended now!\xe2\x80\x9d said his friend, lighting a cigar to master his\nsleepiness. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is that you have not yet loved and do not know\nwhat love is.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe man in the fur-lined coat was going to speak again, and put his\nhands to his head, but could not express what he wanted to say.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever loved! ... Yes, quite true, I never have! But after all, I have\nwithin me a desire to love, and nothing could be stronger than that\ndesire! But then, again, does such love exist? There always remains\nsomething incomplete. Ah well! What\xe2\x80\x99s the use of talking? I\xe2\x80\x99ve made an\nawful mess of life! But anyhow it\xe2\x80\x99s all over now; you are quite right.\nAnd I feel that I am beginning a new life.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich you will again make a mess of,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man who lay on the sofa\nplaying with his watch-key. But the traveller did not listen to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sad and yet glad to go,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy I am sad I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the traveller went on talking about himself, without noticing that\nthis did not interest the others as much as it did him. A man is never\nsuch an egotist as at moments of spiritual ecstasy. At such times it\nseems to him that there is nothing on earth more splendid and\ninteresting than himself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDm\xc3\xadtri Andr\xc3\xa9ich! The coachman won\xe2\x80\x99t wait any longer!\xe2\x80\x9d said a young\nserf, entering the room in a sheepskin coat, with a scarf tied round\nhis head. \xe2\x80\x9cThe horses have been standing since twelve, and it\xe2\x80\x99s now\nfour o\xe2\x80\x99clock!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDm\xc3\xadtri Andr\xc3\xa9ich looked at his serf, Vany\xc3\xbasha. The scarf round\nVany\xc3\xbasha\xe2\x80\x99s head, his felt boots and sleepy face, seemed to be calling\nhis master to a new life of labour, hardship, and activity.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue enough! Good-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, feeling for the unfastened hook and\neye on his coat.\n\nIn spite of advice to mollify the coachman by another tip, he put on\nhis cap and stood in the middle of the room. The friends kissed once,\nthen again, and after a pause, a third time. The man in the fur-lined\ncoat approached the table and emptied a champagne glass, then took the\nplain little man\xe2\x80\x99s hand and blushed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh well, I will speak out all the same ... I must and will be frank\nwith you because I am fond of you ... Of course you love her\xe2\x80\x94I always\nthought so\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered his friend, smiling still more gently.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd perhaps...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease sir, I have orders to put out the candles,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sleepy\nattendant, who had been listening to the last part of the conversation\nand wondering why gentlefolk always talk about one and the same thing.\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo whom shall I make out the bill? To you, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, knowing\nwhom to address and turning to the tall man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the tall man. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty-six rubles.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe tall man considered for a moment, but said nothing and put the bill\nin his pocket.\n\nThe other two continued their talk.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, you are a capital fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d said the short plain man with the\nmild eyes. Tears filled the eyes of both. They stepped into the porch.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, by the by,\xe2\x80\x9d said the traveller, turning with a blush to the tall\nman, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you settle Chevalier\xe2\x80\x99s bill and write and let me know?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, all right!\xe2\x80\x9d said the tall man, pulling on his gloves. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\nI envy you!\xe2\x80\x9d he added quite unexpectedly when they were out in the\nporch.\n\nThe traveller got into his sledge, wrapped his coat about him, and\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cWell then, come along!\xe2\x80\x9d He even moved a little to make room in\nthe sledge for the man who said he envied him\xe2\x80\x94his voice trembled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, M\xc3\xadtya! I hope that with God\xe2\x80\x99s help you...\xe2\x80\x9d said the tall\none. But his wish was that the other would go away quickly, and so he\ncould not finish the sentence.\n\nThey were silent a moment. Then someone again said, \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d and a\nvoice cried, \xe2\x80\x9cReady,\xe2\x80\x9d and the coachman touched up the horses.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHy, Elis\xc3\xa1r!\xe2\x80\x9d One of the friends called out, and the other coachman and\nthe sledge-drivers began moving, clicking their tongues and pulling at\nthe reins. Then the stiffened carriage-wheels rolled squeaking over the\nfrozen snow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fine fellow, that Ol\xc3\xa9nin!\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the friends. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what an\nidea to go to the Caucasus\xe2\x80\x94as a cadet, too! I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it for\nanything. ... Are you dining at the club tomorrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey separated.\n\nThe traveller felt warm, his fur coat seemed too hot. He sat on the\nbottom of the sledge and unfastened his coat, and the three shaggy\npost-horses dragged themselves out of one dark street into another,\npast houses he had never before seen. It seemed to Ol\xc3\xa9nin that only\ntravellers starting on a long journey went through those streets. All\nwas dark and silent and dull around him, but his soul was full of\nmemories, love, regrets, and a pleasant tearful feeling.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter II\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m fond of them, very fond! ... First-rate fellows! ... Fine!\xe2\x80\x9d he\nkept repeating, and felt ready to cry. But why he wanted to cry, who\nwere the first-rate fellows he was so fond of\xe2\x80\x94was more than he quite\nknew. Now and then he looked round at some house and wondered why it\nwas so curiously built; sometimes he began wondering why the post-boy\nand Vany\xc3\xbasha, who were so different from himself, sat so near, and\ntogether with him were being jerked about and swayed by the tugs the\nside-horses gave at the frozen traces, and again he repeated: \xe2\x80\x9cFirst\nrate ... very fond!\xe2\x80\x9d and once he even said: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how it seizes one ...\nexcellent!\xe2\x80\x9d and wondered what made him say it. \xe2\x80\x9cDear me, am I drunk?\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe asked himself. He had had a couple of bottles of wine, but it was\nnot the wine alone that was having this effect on Ol\xc3\xa9nin. He remembered\nall the words of friendship heartily, bashfully, spontaneously (as he\nbelieved) addressed to him on his departure. He remembered the clasp of\nhands, glances, the moments of silence, and the sound of a voice\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, M\xc3\xadtya!\xe2\x80\x9d when he was already in the sledge. He\nremembered his own deliberate frankness. And all this had a touching\nsignificance for him. Not only friends and relatives, not only people\nwho had been indifferent to him, but even those who did not like him,\nseemed to have agreed to become fonder of him, or to forgive him,\nbefore his departure, as people do before confession or death. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps\nI shall not return from the Caucasus,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. And he felt that he\nloved his friends and some one besides. He was sorry for himself. But\nit was not love for his friends that so stirred and uplifted his heart\nthat he could not repress the meaningless words that seemed to rise of\nthemselves to his lips; nor was it love for a woman (he had never yet\nbeen in love) that had brought on this mood. Love for himself, love\nfull of hope\xe2\x80\x94warm young love for all that was good in his own soul (and\nat that moment it seemed to him that there was nothing but good in\nit)\xe2\x80\x94compelled him to weep and to mutter incoherent words.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin was a youth who had never completed his university course, never\nserved anywhere (having only a nominal post in some government office\nor other), who had squandered half his fortune and had reached the age\nof twenty-four without having done anything or even chosen a career. He\nwas what in Moscow society is termed _un jeune homme_.\n\nAt the age of eighteen he was free\xe2\x80\x94as only rich young Russians in the\n\xe2\x80\x99forties who had lost their parents at an early age could be. Neither\nphysical nor moral fetters of any kind existed for him; he could do as\nhe liked, lacking nothing and bound by nothing. Neither relatives, nor\nfatherland, nor religion, nor wants, existed for him. He believed in\nnothing and admitted nothing. But although he believed in nothing he\nwas not a morose or blase young man, nor self-opinionated, but on the\ncontrary continually let himself be carried away. He had come to the\nconclusion that there is no such thing as love, yet his heart always\noverflowed in the presence of any young and attractive woman. He had\nlong been aware that honours and position were nonsense, yet\ninvoluntarily he felt pleased when at a ball Prince Sergius came up and\nspoke to him affably. But he yielded to his impulses only in so far as\nthey did not limit his freedom. As soon as he had yielded to any\ninfluence and became conscious of its leading on to labour and\nstruggle, he instinctively hastened to free himself from the feeling or\nactivity into which he was being drawn and to regain his freedom. In\nthis way he experimented with society-life, the civil service, farming,\nmusic\xe2\x80\x94to which at one time he intended to devote his life\xe2\x80\x94and even with\nthe love of women in which he did not believe. He meditated on the use\nto which he should devote that power of youth which is granted to man\nonly once in a lifetime: that force which gives a man the power of\nmaking himself, or even\xe2\x80\x94as it seemed to him\xe2\x80\x94of making the universe,\ninto anything he wishes: should it be to art, to science, to love of\nwoman, or to practical activities? It is true that some people are\ndevoid of this impulse, and on entering life at once place their necks\nunder the first yoke that offers itself and honestly labour under it\nfor the rest of their lives. But Ol\xc3\xa9nin was too strongly conscious of\nthe presence of that all-powerful God of Youth\xe2\x80\x94of that capacity to be\nentirely transformed into an aspiration or idea\xe2\x80\x94the capacity to wish\nand to do\xe2\x80\x94to throw oneself headlong into a bottomless abyss without\nknowing why or wherefore. He bore this consciousness within himself,\nwas proud of it and, without knowing it, was happy in that\nconsciousness. Up to that time he had loved only himself, and could not\nhelp loving himself, for he expected nothing but good of himself and\nhad not yet had time to be disillusioned. On leaving Moscow he was in\nthat happy state of mind in which a young man, conscious of past\nmistakes, suddenly says to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cThat was not the real thing.\xe2\x80\x9d All\nthat had gone before was accidental and unimportant. Till then he had\nnot really tried to live, but now with his departure from Moscow a new\nlife was beginning\xe2\x80\x94a life in which there would be no mistakes, no\nremorse, and certainly nothing but happiness.\n\nIt is always the case on a long journey that till the first two or\nthree stages have been passed imagination continues to dwell on the\nplace left behind, but with the first morning on the road it leaps to\nthe end of the journey and there begins building castles in the air. So\nit happened to Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\nAfter leaving the town behind, he gazed at the snowy fields and felt\nglad to be alone in their midst. Wrapping himself in his fur coat, he\nlay at the bottom of the sledge, became tranquil, and fell into a doze.\nThe parting with his friends had touched him deeply, and memories of\nthat last winter spent in Moscow and images of the past, mingled with\nvague thoughts and regrets, rose unbidden in his imagination.\n\nHe remembered the friend who had seen him off and his relations with\nthe girl they had talked about. The girl was rich. \xe2\x80\x9cHow could he love\nher knowing that she loved me?\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, and evil suspicions crossed\nhis mind. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is much dishonesty in men when one comes to reflect.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThen he was confronted by the question: \xe2\x80\x9cBut really, how is it I have\nnever been in love? Every one tells me that I never have. Can it be\nthat I am a moral monstrosity?\xe2\x80\x9d And he began to recall all his\ninfatuations. He recalled his entry into society, and a friend\xe2\x80\x99s sister\nwith whom he spent several evenings at a table with a lamp on it which\nlit up her slender fingers busy with needlework, and the lower part of\nher pretty delicate face. He recalled their conversations that dragged\non like the game in which one passes on a stick which one keeps alight\nas long as possible, and the general awkwardness and restraint and his\ncontinual feeling of rebellion at all that conventionality. Some voice\nhad always whispered: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not it, that\xe2\x80\x99s not it,\xe2\x80\x9d and so it had\nproved. Then he remembered a ball and the mazurka he danced with the\nbeautiful D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much in love I was that night and how happy! And\nhow hurt and vexed I was next morning when I woke and felt myself still\nfree! Why does not love come and bind me hand and foot?\xe2\x80\x9d thought he.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, there is no such thing as love! That neighbour who used to tell\nme, as she told Dubr\xc3\xb3vin and the Marshal, that she loved the stars, was\nnot _it_ either.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd now his farming and work in the country recurred to his mind, and\nin those recollections also there was nothing to dwell on with\npleasure. \xe2\x80\x9cWill they talk long of my departure?\xe2\x80\x9d came into his head;\nbut who \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x9d were he did not quite know. Next came a thought that\nmade him wince and mutter incoherently. It was the recollection of M.\nCappele the tailor, and the six hundred and seventy-eight rubles he\nstill owed him, and he recalled the words in which he had begged him to\nwait another year, and the look of perplexity and resignation which had\nappeared on the tailor\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated,\nwincing and trying to drive away the intolerable thought. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the same\nand in spite of everything she loved me,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he of the girl they\nhad talked about at the farewell supper. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, had I married her I\nshould not now be owing anything, and as it is I am in debt to\nVas\xc3\xadlyev.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he remembered the last night he had played with\nVas\xc3\xadlyev at the club (just after leaving her), and he recalled his\nhumiliating requests for another game and the other\xe2\x80\x99s cold refusal. \xe2\x80\x9cA\nyear\xe2\x80\x99s economizing and they will all be paid, and the devil take\nthem!\xe2\x80\x9d... But despite this assurance he again began calculating his\noutstanding debts, their dates, and when he could hope to pay them off.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I owe something to Morell as well as to Chevalier,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he,\nrecalling the night when he had run up so large a debt. It was at a\ncarousel at the gipsies arranged by some fellows from Petersburg:\nS\xc3\xa1shka B\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, an aide-de-camp to the Tsar, Prince D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, and that pompous\nold\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94. \xe2\x80\x9cHow is it those gentlemen are so self-satisfied?\xe2\x80\x9d thought he,\n\xe2\x80\x9cand by what right do they form a clique to which they think others\nmust be highly flattered to be admitted? Can it be because they are on\nthe Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s staff? Why, it\xe2\x80\x99s awful what fools and scoundrels they\nconsider other people to be! But I showed them that I at any rate, on\nthe contrary, do not at all want their intimacy. All the same, I fancy\nAndrew, the steward, would be amazed to know that I am on familiar\nterms with a man like S\xc3\xa1shka B\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, a colonel and an aide-de-camp to the\nTsar! Yes, and no one drank more than I did that evening, and I taught\nthe gipsies a new song and everyone listened to it. Though I have done\nmany foolish things, all the same I am a very good fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he.\n\nMorning found him at the third post-stage. He drank tea, and himself\nhelped Vany\xc3\xbasha to move his bundles and trunks and sat down among them,\nsensible, erect, and precise, knowing where all his belongings were,\nhow much money he had and where it was, where he had put his passport\nand the post-horse requisition and toll-gate papers, and it all seemed\nto him so well arranged that he grew quite cheerful and the long\njourney before him seemed an extended pleasure-trip.\n\nAll that morning and noon he was deep in calculations of how many\nversts he had travelled, how many remained to the next stage, how many\nto the next town, to the place where he would dine, to the place where\nhe would drink tea, and to Stavr\xc3\xb3pol, and what fraction of the whole\njourney was already accomplished. He also calculated how much money he\nhad with him, how much would be left over, how much would pay off all\nhis debts, and what proportion of his income he would spend each month.\nTowards evening, after tea, he calculated that to Stavr\xc3\xb3pol there still\nremained seven-elevenths of the whole journey, that his debts would\nrequire seven months\xe2\x80\x99 economy and one-eighth of his whole fortune; and\nthen, tranquillized, he wrapped himself up, lay down in the sledge, and\nagain dozed off. His imagination was now turned to the future: to the\nCaucasus. All his dreams of the future were mingled with pictures of\nAmalat-Beks, Circassian women, mountains, precipices, terrible\ntorrents, and perils. All these things were vague and dim, but the love\nof fame and the danger of death furnished the interest of that future.\nNow, with unprecedented courage and a strength that amazed everyone, he\nslew and subdued an innumerable host of hillsmen; now he was himself a\nhillsman and with them was maintaining their independence against the\nRussians. As soon as he pictured anything definite, familiar Moscow\nfigures always appeared on the scene. S\xc3\xa1shka B\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 fights with the\nRussians or the hillsmen against him. Even the tailor Cappele in some\nstrange way takes part in the conqueror\xe2\x80\x99s triumph. Amid all this he\nremembered his former humiliations, weaknesses, and mistakes, and the\nrecollection was not disagreeable. It was clear that there among the\nmountains, waterfalls, fair Circassians, and dangers, such mistakes\ncould not recur. Having once made full confession to himself there was\nan end of it all. One other vision, the sweetest of them all, mingled\nwith the young man\xe2\x80\x99s every thought of the future\xe2\x80\x94the vision of a woman.\nAnd there, among the mountains, she appeared to his imagination as a\nCircassian slave, a fine figure with a long plait of hair and deep\nsubmissive eyes. He pictured a lonely hut in the mountains, and on the\nthreshold _she_ stands awaiting him when, tired and covered with dust,\nblood, and fame, he returns to her. He is conscious of her kisses, her\nshoulders, her sweet voice, and her submissiveness. She is enchanting,\nbut uneducated, wild, and rough. In the long winter evenings he begins\nher education. She is clever and gifted and quickly acquires all the\nknowledge essential. Why not? She can quite easily learn foreign\nlanguages, read the French masterpieces and understand them: _Notre\nDame de Paris_, for instance, is sure to please her. She can also speak\nFrench. In a drawing-room she can show more innate dignity than a lady\nof the highest society. She can sing, simply, powerfully, and\npassionately.... \xe2\x80\x9cOh, what nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d said he to himself. But here they\nreached a post-station and he had to change into another sledge and\ngive some tips. But his fancy again began searching for the \xe2\x80\x9cnonsense\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe had relinquished, and again fair Circassians, glory, and his return\nto Russia with an appointment as aide-de-camp and a lovely wife rose\nbefore his imagination. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there\xe2\x80\x99s no such thing as love,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to\nhimself. \xe2\x80\x9cFame is all rubbish. But the six hundred and seventy-eight\nrubles?... And the conquered land that will bring me more wealth than I\nneed for a lifetime? It will not be right though to keep all that\nwealth for myself. I shall have to distribute it. But to whom? Well,\nsix hundred and seventy-eight rubles to Cappele and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xe2\x80\x9d\n... Quite vague visions now cloud his mind, and only Vany\xc3\xbasha\xe2\x80\x99s voice\nand the interrupted motion of the sledge break his healthy youthful\nslumber. Scarcely conscious, he changes into another sledge at the next\nstage and continues his journey.\n\nNext morning everything goes on just the same: the same kind of\npost-stations and tea-drinking, the same moving horses\xe2\x80\x99 cruppers, the\nsame short talks with Vany\xc3\xbasha, the same vague dreams and drowsiness,\nand the same tired, healthy, youthful sleep at night.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter III\n\n\nThe farther Ol\xc3\xa9nin travelled from Central Russia the farther he left\nhis memories behind, and the nearer he drew to the Caucasus the lighter\nhis heart became. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll stay away for good and never return to show\nmyself in society,\xe2\x80\x9d was a thought that sometimes occurred to him.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese people whom I see here are _not_ people. None of them know me\nand none of them can ever enter the Moscow society I was in or find out\nabout my past. And no one in that society will ever know what I am\ndoing, living among these people.\xe2\x80\x9d And quite a new feeling of freedom\nfrom his whole past came over him among the rough beings he met on the\nroad whom he did not consider to be _people_ in the sense that his\nMoscow acquaintances were.\n\nThe rougher the people and the fewer the signs of civilization the\nfreer he felt. Stavr\xc3\xb3pol, through which he had to pass, irked him. The\nsignboards, some of them even in French, ladies in carriages, cabs in\nthe marketplace, and a gentleman wearing a fur cloak and tall hat who\nwas walking along the boulevard and staring at the passersby, quite\nupset him. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps these people know some of my acquaintances,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nthought; and the club, his tailor, cards, society ... came back to his\nmind. But after Stavr\xc3\xb3pol everything was satisfactory\xe2\x80\x94wild and also\nbeautiful and warlike, and Ol\xc3\xa9nin felt happier and happier. All the\nCossacks, post-boys, and post-station masters seemed to him simple folk\nwith whom he could jest and converse simply, without having to consider\nto what class they belonged. They all belonged to the human race which,\nwithout his thinking about it, all appeared dear to Ol\xc3\xa9nin, and they\nall treated him in a friendly way.\n\nAlready in the province of the Don Cossacks his sledge had been\nexchanged for a cart, and beyond Stavr\xc3\xb3pol it became so warm that\nOl\xc3\xa9nin travelled without wearing his fur coat. It was already spring\xe2\x80\x94an\nunexpected joyous spring for Ol\xc3\xa9nin. At night he was no longer allowed\nto leave the Cossack villages, and they said it was dangerous to travel\nin the evening. Vany\xc3\xbasha began to be uneasy, and they carried a loaded\ngun in the cart. Ol\xc3\xa9nin became still happier. At one of the\npost-stations the post-master told of a terrible murder that had been\ncommitted recently on the high road. They began to meet armed men. \xe2\x80\x9cSo\nthis is where it begins!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Ol\xc3\xa9nin, and kept expecting to see the\nsnowy mountains of which mention was so often made. Once, towards\nevening, the Nog\xc3\xa1y driver pointed with his whip to the mountains\nshrouded in clouds. Ol\xc3\xa9nin looked eagerly, but it was dull and the\nmountains were almost hidden by the clouds. Ol\xc3\xa9nin made out something\ngrey and white and fleecy, but try as he would he could find nothing\nbeautiful in the mountains of which he had so often read and heard. The\nmountains and the clouds appeared to him quite alike, and he thought\nthe special beauty of the snow peaks, of which he had so often been\ntold, was as much an invention as Bach\xe2\x80\x99s music and the love of women,\nin which he did not believe. So he gave up looking forward to seeing\nthe mountains. But early next morning, being awakened in his cart by\nthe freshness of the air, he glanced carelessly to the right. The\nmorning was perfectly clear. Suddenly he saw, about twenty paces away\nas it seemed to him at first glance, pure white gigantic masses with\ndelicate contours, the distinct fantastic outlines of their summits\nshowing sharply against the far-off sky. When he had realized the\ndistance between himself and them and the sky and the whole immensity\nof the mountains, and felt the infinitude of all that beauty, he became\nafraid that it was but a phantasm or a dream. He gave himself a shake\nto rouse himself, but the mountains were still the same.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that! What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the driver.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the mountains,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Nog\xc3\xa1y driver with indifference.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I too have been looking at them for a long while,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vany\xc3\xbasha.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t they fine? They won\xe2\x80\x99t believe it at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe quick progress of the three-horsed cart along the smooth road\ncaused the mountains to appear to be running along the horizon, while\ntheir rosy crests glittered in the light of the rising sun. At first\nOl\xc3\xa9nin was only astonished at the sight, then gladdened by it; but\nlater on, gazing more and more intently at that snow-peaked chain that\nseemed to rise not from among other black mountains, but straight out\nof the plain, and to glide away into the distance, he began by slow\ndegrees to be penetrated by their beauty and at length to _feel_ the\nmountains. From that moment all he saw, all he thought, and all he\nfelt, acquired for him a new character, sternly majestic like the\nmountains! All his Moscow reminiscences, shame, and repentance, and his\ntrivial dreams about the Caucasus, vanished and did not return. \xe2\x80\x9cNow it\nhas begun,\xe2\x80\x9d a solemn voice seemed to say to him. The road and the\nT\xc3\xa9rek, just becoming visible in the distance, and the Cossack villages\nand the people, all no longer appeared to him as a joke. He looked at\nhimself or Vany\xc3\xbasha, and again thought of the mountains. ... Two\nCossacks ride by, their guns in their cases swinging rhythmically\nbehind their backs, the white and bay legs of their horses mingling\nconfusedly ... and the mountains! Beyond the T\xc3\xa9rek rises the smoke from\na Tartar village... and the mountains! The sun has risen and glitters\non the T\xc3\xa9rek, now visible beyond the reeds ... and the mountains! From\nthe village comes a Tartar wagon, and women, beautiful young women,\npass by... and the mountains! \xe2\x80\x9c_Abreks_ canter about the plain, and\nhere am I driving along and do not fear them! I have a gun, and\nstrength, and youth... and the mountains!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n Chapter IV\n\n\nThat whole part of the T\xc3\xa9rek line (about fifty miles) along which lie\nthe villages of the Greb\xc3\xa9nsk Cossacks is uniform in character both as\nto country and inhabitants. The T\xc3\xa9rek, which separates the Cossacks\nfrom the mountaineers, still flows turbid and rapid though already\nbroad and smooth, always depositing greyish sand on its low reedy right\nbank and washing away the steep, though not high, left bank, with its\nroots of century-old oaks, its rotting plane trees, and young\nbrushwood. On the right bank lie the villages of pro-Russian, though\nstill somewhat restless, Tartars. Along the left bank, back half a mile\nfrom the river and standing five or six miles apart from one another,\nare Cossack villages. In olden times most of these villages were\nsituated on the banks of the river; but the T\xc3\xa9rek, shifting northward\nfrom the mountains year by year, washed away those banks, and now there\nremain only the ruins of the old villages and of the gardens of pear\nand plum trees and poplars, all overgrown with blackberry bushes and\nwild vines. No one lives there now, and one only sees the tracks of the\ndeer, the wolves, the hares, and the pheasants, who have learned to\nlove these places. From village to village runs a road cut through the\nforest as a cannon-shot might fly. Along the roads are cordons of\nCossacks and watch-towers with sentinels in them. Only a narrow strip\nabout seven hundred yards wide of fertile wooded soil belongs to the\nCossacks. To the north of it begin the sand-drifts of the Nog\xc3\xa1y or\nMozd\xc3\xb3k steppes, which fetch far to the north and run, Heaven knows\nwhere, into the Trukhm\xc3\xa9n, Astrakh\xc3\xa1n, and Kirgh\xc3\xadz-Kais\xc3\xa1tsk steppes. To\nthe south, beyond the T\xc3\xa9rek, are the Great Ch\xc3\xa9chnya river, the\nKochk\xc3\xa1lov range, the Black Mountains, yet another range, and at last\nthe snowy mountains, which can just be seen but have never yet been\nscaled. In this fertile wooded strip, rich in vegetation, has dwelt as\nfar back as memory runs the fine warlike and prosperous Russian tribe\nbelonging to the sect of Old Believers, and called the Greb\xc3\xa9nsk\nCossacks.\n\nLong long ago their Old Believer ancestors fled from Russia and settled\nbeyond the T\xc3\xa9rek among the Ch\xc3\xa9chens on the Greb\xc3\xa9n, the first range of\nwooded mountains of Ch\xc3\xa9chnya. Living among the Ch\xc3\xa9chens the Cossacks\nintermarried with them and adopted the manners and customs of the hill\ntribes, though they still retained the Russian language in all its\npurity, as well as their Old Faith. A tradition, still fresh among\nthem, declares that Tsar Iv\xc3\xa1n the Terrible came to the T\xc3\xa9rek, sent for\ntheir Elders, and gave them the land on this side of the river,\nexhorting them to remain friendly to Russia and promising not to\nenforce his rule upon them nor oblige them to change their faith. Even\nnow the Cossack families claim relationship with the Ch\xc3\xa9chens, and the\nlove of freedom, of leisure, of plunder and of war, still form their\nchief characteristics. Only the harmful side of Russian influence shows\nitself\xe2\x80\x94by interference at elections, by confiscation of church bells,\nand by the troops who are quartered in the country or march through it.\n\nA Cossack is inclined to hate less the _dzhigit_ hillsman who maybe has\nkilled his brother, than the soldier quartered on him to defend his\nvillage, but who has defiled his hut with tobacco-smoke. He respects\nhis enemy the hillsman and despises the soldier, who is in his eyes an\nalien and an oppressor. In reality, from a Cossack\xe2\x80\x99s point of view a\nRussian peasant is a foreign, savage, despicable creature, of whom he\nsees a sample in the hawkers who come to the country and in the\nUkrainian immigrants whom the Cossack contemptuously calls\n\xe2\x80\x9cwoolbeaters\xe2\x80\x9d. For him, to be smartly dressed means to be dressed like\na Circassian. The best weapons are obtained from the hillsmen and the\nbest horses are bought, or stolen, from them. A dashing young Cossack\nlikes to show off his knowledge of Tartar, and when carousing talks\nTartar even to his fellow Cossack.\n\nIn spite of all these things this small Christian clan stranded in a\ntiny corner of the earth, surrounded by half-savage Mohammedan tribes\nand by soldiers, considers itself highly advanced, acknowledges none\nbut Cossacks as human beings, and despises everybody else. The Cossack\nspends most of his time in the cordon, in action, or in hunting and\nfishing. He hardly ever works at home. When he stays in the village it\nis an exception to the general rule and then he is holiday-making. All\nCossacks make their own wine, and drunkenness is not so much a general\ntendency as a rite, the non-fulfilment of which would be considered\napostasy. The Cossack looks upon a woman as an instrument for his\nwelfare; only the unmarried girls are allowed to amuse themselves. A\nmarried woman has to work for her husband from youth to very old age:\nhis demands on her are the Oriental ones of submission and labour. In\nconsequence of this outlook women are strongly developed both\nphysically and mentally, and though they are\xe2\x80\x94as everywhere in the\nEast\xe2\x80\x94nominally in subjection, they possess far greater influence and\nimportance in family-life than Western women. Their exclusion from\npublic life and inurement to heavy male labour give the women all the\nmore power and importance in the household. A Cossack, who before\nstrangers considers it improper to speak affectionately or needlessly\nto his wife, when alone with her is involuntarily conscious of her\nsuperiority. His house and all his property, in fact the entire\nhomestead, has been acquired and is kept together solely by her labour\nand care. Though firmly convinced that labour is degrading to a Cossack\nand is only proper for a Nog\xc3\xa1y labourer or a woman, he is vaguely aware\nof the fact that all he makes use of and calls his own is the result of\nthat toil, and that it is in the power of the woman (his mother or his\nwife) whom he considers his slave, to deprive him of all he possesses.\nBesides, the continuous performance of man\xe2\x80\x99s heavy work and the\nresponsibilities entrusted to her have endowed the Greb\xc3\xa9nsk women with\na peculiarly independent masculine character and have remarkably\ndeveloped their physical powers, common sense, resolution, and\nstability. The women are in most cases stronger, more intelligent, more\ndeveloped, and handsomer than the men. A striking feature of a Greb\xc3\xa9nsk\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s beauty is the combination of the purest Circassian type of face\nwith the broad and powerful build of Northern women. Cossack women wear\nthe Circassian dress: a Tartar smock, _beshmet_, and soft slippers; but\nthey tie their kerchiefs round their heads in the Russian fashion.\nSmartness, cleanliness and elegance in dress and in the arrangement of\ntheir huts, are with them a custom and a necessity. In their relations\nwith men the women, and especially the unmarried girls, enjoy perfect\nfreedom.\n\nNovoml\xc3\xadnsk village was considered the very heart of Greb\xc3\xa9nsk\nCossackdom. In it more than elsewhere the customs of the old Greb\xc3\xa9nsk\npopulation have been preserved, and its women have from time immemorial\nbeen renowned all over the Caucasus for their beauty. A Cossack\xe2\x80\x99s\nlivelihood is derived from vineyards, fruit-gardens, water melon and\npumpkin plantations, from fishing, hunting, maize and millet growing,\nand from war plunder. Novoml\xc3\xadnsk village lies about two and a half\nmiles away from the T\xc3\xa9rek, from which it is separated by a dense\nforest. On one side of the road which runs through the village is the\nriver; on the other, green vineyards and orchards, beyond which are\nseen the driftsands of the Nog\xc3\xa1y Steppe. The village is surrounded by\nearth-banks and prickly bramble hedges, and is entered by tall gates\nhung between posts and covered with little reed-thatched roofs. Beside\nthem on a wooden gun-carriage stands an unwieldy cannon captured by the\nCossacks at some time or other, and which has not been fired for a\nhundred years. A uniformed Cossack sentinel with dagger and gun\nsometimes stands, and sometimes does not stand, on guard beside the\ngates, and sometimes presents arms to a passing officer and sometimes\ndoes not.\n\nBelow the roof of the gateway is written in black letters on a white\nboard: \xe2\x80\x9cHouses 266: male inhabitants 897: female 1012.\xe2\x80\x9d The Cossacks\xe2\x80\x99\nhouses are all raised on pillars two and a half feet from the ground.\nThey are carefully thatched with reeds and have large carved gables. If\nnot new they are at least all straight and clean, with high porches of\ndifferent shapes; and they are not built close together but have ample\nspace around them, and are all picturesquely placed along broad streets\nand lanes. In front of the large bright windows of many of the houses,\nbeyond the kitchen gardens, dark green poplars and acacias with their\ndelicate pale verdure and scented white blossoms overtop the houses,\nand beside them grow flaunting yellow sunflowers, creepers, and grape\nvines. In the broad open square are three shops where drapery,\nsunflower and pumpkin seeds, locust beans and gingerbreads are sold;\nand surrounded by a tall fence, loftier and larger than the other\nhouses, stands the Regimental Commander\xe2\x80\x99s dwelling with its casement\nwindows, behind a row of tall poplars. Few people are to be seen in the\nstreets of the village on weekdays, especially in summer. The young men\nare on duty in the cordons or on military expeditions; the old ones are\nfishing or helping the women in the orchards and gardens. Only the very\nold, the sick, and the children, remain at home.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter V\n\n\nIt was one of those wonderful evenings that occur only in the Caucasus.\nThe sun had sunk behind the mountains but it was still light. The\nevening glow had spread over a third of the sky, and against its\nbrilliancy the dull white immensity of the mountains was sharply\ndefined. The air was rarefied, motionless, and full of sound. The\nshadow of the mountains reached for several miles over the steppe. The\nsteppe, the opposite side of the river, and the roads, were all\ndeserted. If very occasionally mounted men appeared, the Cossacks in\nthe cordon and the Ch\xc3\xa9chens in their _aouls_ (villages) watched them\nwith surprised curiosity and tried to guess who those questionable men\ncould be.\n\nAt nightfall people from fear of one another flock to their dwellings,\nand only birds and beasts fearless of man prowl in those deserted\nspaces. Talking merrily, the women who have been tying up the vines\nhurry away from the gardens before sunset. The vineyards, like all the\nsurrounding district, are deserted, but the villages become very\nanimated at that time of the evening. From all sides, walking, riding,\nor driving in their creaking carts, people move towards the village.\nGirls with their smocks tucked up and twigs in their hands run chatting\nmerrily to the village gates to meet the cattle that are crowding\ntogether in a cloud of dust and mosquitoes which they bring with them\nfrom the steppe. The well-fed cows and buffaloes disperse at a run all\nover the streets and Cossack women in coloured _beshmets_ go to and fro\namong them. You can hear their merry laughter and shrieks mingling with\nthe lowing of the cattle. There an armed and mounted Cossack, on leave\nfrom the cordon, rides up to a hut and, leaning towards the window,\nknocks. In answer to the knock the handsome head of a young woman\nappears at the window and you can hear caressing, laughing voices.\nThere a tattered Nog\xc3\xa1y labourer, with prominent cheekbones, brings a\nload of reeds from the steppes, turns his creaking cart into the\nCossack captain\xe2\x80\x99s broad and clean courtyard, and lifts the yoke off the\noxen that stand tossing their heads while he and his master shout to\none another in Tartar. Past a puddle that reaches nearly across the\nstreet, a barefooted Cossack woman with a bundle of firewood on her\nback makes her laborious way by clinging to the fences, holding her\nsmock high and exposing her white legs. A Cossack returning from\nshooting calls out in jest: \xe2\x80\x9cLift it higher, shameless thing!\xe2\x80\x9d and\npoints his gun at her. The woman lets down her smock and drops the\nwood. An old Cossack, returning home from fishing with his trousers\ntucked up and his hairy grey chest uncovered, has a net across his\nshoulder containing silvery fish that are still struggling; and to take\na short cut climbs over his neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s broken fence and gives a tug to\nhis coat which has caught on the fence. There a woman is dragging a dry\nbranch along and from round the corner comes the sound of an axe.\nCossack children, spinning their tops wherever there is a smooth place\nin the street, are shrieking; women are climbing over fences to avoid\ngoing round. From every chimney rises the odorous _kisyak_ smoke. From\nevery homestead comes the sound of increased bustle, precursor to the\nstillness of night.\n\nGranny Ul\xc3\xadtka, the wife of the Cossack cornet who is also teacher in\nthe regimental school, goes out to the gates of her yard like the other\nwomen, and waits for the cattle which her daughter Mary\xc3\xa1nka is driving\nalong the street. Before she has had time fully to open the wattle gate\nin the fence, an enormous buffalo cow surrounded by mosquitoes rushes\nup bellowing and squeezes in. Several well-fed cows slowly follow her,\ntheir large eyes gazing with recognition at their mistress as they\nswish their sides with their tails.\n\nThe beautiful and shapely Mary\xc3\xa1nka enters at the gate and throwing away\nher switch quickly slams the gate to and rushes with all the speed of\nher nimble feet to separate and drive the cattle into their sheds.\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake off your slippers, you devil\xe2\x80\x99s wench!\xe2\x80\x9d shouts her mother, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve\nworn them into holes!\xe2\x80\x9d Mary\xc3\xa1nka is not at all offended at being called\na \xe2\x80\x9cdevil\xe2\x80\x99s wench\xe2\x80\x9d, but accepting it as a term of endearment cheerfully\ngoes on with her task. Her face is covered with a kerchief tied round\nher head. She is wearing a pink smock and a green _beshmet_. She\ndisappears inside the lean-to shed in the yard, following the big fat\ncattle; and from the shed comes her voice as she speaks gently and\npersuasively to the buffalo: \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t she stand still? What a creature!\nCome now, come old dear!\xe2\x80\x9d Soon the girl and the old woman pass from the\nshed to the dairy carrying two large pots of milk, the day\xe2\x80\x99s yield.\nFrom the dairy chimney rises a thin cloud of _kisyak_ smoke: the milk\nis being used to make into clotted cream. The girl makes up the fire\nwhile her mother goes to the gate. Twilight has fallen on the village.\nThe air is full of the smell of vegetables, cattle, and scented\n_kisyak_ smoke. From the gates and along the streets Cossack women come\nrunning, carrying lighted rags. From the yards one hears the snorting\nand quiet chewing of the cattle eased of their milk, while in the\nstreet only the voices of women and children sound as they call to one\nanother. It is rare on a week-day to hear the drunken voice of a man.\n\nOne of the Cossack wives, a tall, masculine old woman, approaches\nGranny Ul\xc3\xadtka from the homestead opposite and asks her for a light. In\nher hand she holds a rag.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you cleared up, Granny?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe girl is lighting the fire. Is it fire you want?\xe2\x80\x9d says Granny\nUl\xc3\xadtka, proud of being able to oblige her neighbour.\n\nBoth women enter the hut, and coarse hands unused to dealing with small\narticles tremblingly lift the lid of a matchbox, which is a rarity in\nthe Caucasus. The masculine-looking new-comer sits down on the doorstep\nwith the evident intention of having a chat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is your man at the school, Mother?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s always teaching the youngsters, Mother. But he writes that he\xe2\x80\x99ll\ncome home for the holidays,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cornet\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he\xe2\x80\x99s a clever man, one sees; it all comes useful.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it does.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd my Luk\xc3\xa1shka is at the cordon; they won\xe2\x80\x99t let him come home,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nthe visitor, though the cornet\xe2\x80\x99s wife had known all this long ago. She\nwanted to talk about her Luk\xc3\xa1shka whom she had lately fitted out for\nservice in the Cossack regiment, and whom she wished to marry to the\ncornet\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, Mary\xc3\xa1nka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo he\xe2\x80\x99s at the cordon?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is, Mother. He\xe2\x80\x99s not been home since last holidays. The other day I\nsent him some shirts by F\xc3\xb3mushkin. He says he\xe2\x80\x99s all right, and that his\nsuperiors are satisfied. He says they are looking out for _abreks_\nagain. Luk\xc3\xa1shka is quite happy, he says.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh well, thank God,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cornet\xe2\x80\x99s wife. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Snatcher\xe2\x80\x99 is certainly\nthe only word for him.\xe2\x80\x9d Luk\xc3\xa1shka was surnamed \xe2\x80\x9cthe Snatcher\xe2\x80\x9d because of\nhis bravery in snatching a boy from a watery grave, and the cornet\xe2\x80\x99s\nwife alluded to this, wishing in her turn to say something agreeable to\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s mother.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank God, Mother, that he\xe2\x80\x99s a good son! He\xe2\x80\x99s a fine fellow,\neveryone praises him,\xe2\x80\x9d says Luk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s mother. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I wish is to get\nhim married; then I could die in peace.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, aren\xe2\x80\x99t there plenty of young women in the village?\xe2\x80\x9d answered the\ncornet\xe2\x80\x99s wife slyly as she carefully replaced the lid of the matchbox\nwith her horny hands.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlenty, Mother, plenty,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Luk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s mother, shaking her head.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s your girl now, your Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of girl! You\xe2\x80\x99d\nhave to search through the whole place to find such another!\xe2\x80\x9d The\ncornet\xe2\x80\x99s wife knows what Luk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s mother is after, but though she\nbelieves him to be a good Cossack she hangs back: first because she is\na cornet\xe2\x80\x99s wife and rich, while Luk\xc3\xa1shka is the son of a simple Cossack\nand fatherless, secondly because she does not want to part with her\ndaughter yet, but chiefly because propriety demands it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, when Mary\xc3\xa1nka grows up she\xe2\x80\x99ll be marriageable too,\xe2\x80\x9d she answers\nsoberly and modestly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll send the matchmakers to you\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll send them! Only let me get the\nvineyard done and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll come and make our bows to you,\xe2\x80\x9d says\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s mother. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we\xe2\x80\x99ll make our bows to Elias Vas\xc3\xadlich too.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cElias, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d says the cornet\xe2\x80\x99s wife proudly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s to me you must\nspeak! All in its own good time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s mother sees by the stern face of the cornet\xe2\x80\x99s wife that it\nis not the time to say anything more just now, so she lights her rag\nwith the match and says, rising: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t refuse us, think of my words.\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll go, it is time to light the fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs she crosses the road swinging the burning rag, she meets Mary\xc3\xa1nka,\nwho bows.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, she\xe2\x80\x99s a regular queen, a splendid worker, that girl!\xe2\x80\x9d she thinks,\nlooking at the beautiful maiden. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat need for her to grow any more?\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s time she was married and to a good home; married to Luk\xc3\xa1shka!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut Granny Ul\xc3\xadtka had her own cares and she remained sitting on the\nthreshold thinking hard about something, till the girl called her.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter VI\n\n\nThe male population of the village spend their time on military\nexpeditions and in the cordon\xe2\x80\x94or \xe2\x80\x9cat their posts\xe2\x80\x9d, as the Cossacks say.\nTowards evening, that same Luk\xc3\xa1shka the Snatcher, about whom the old\nwomen had been talking, was standing on a watch-tower of the\nN\xc3\xadzhni-Prot\xc3\xb3tsk post situated on the very banks of the T\xc3\xa9rek. Leaning\non the railing of the tower and screwing up his eyes, he looked now far\ninto the distance beyond the T\xc3\xa9rek, now down at his fellow Cossacks,\nand occasionally he addressed the latter. The sun was already\napproaching the snowy range that gleamed white above the fleecy clouds.\nThe clouds undulating at the base of the mountains grew darker and\ndarker. The clearness of evening was noticeable in the air. A sense of\nfreshness came from the woods, though round the post it was still hot.\nThe voices of the talking Cossacks vibrated more sonorously than\nbefore. The moving mass of the T\xc3\xa9rek\xe2\x80\x99s rapid brown waters contrasted\nmore vividly with its motionless banks. The waters were beginning to\nsubside and here and there the wet sands gleamed drab on the banks and\nin the shallows. The other side of the river, just opposite the cordon,\nwas deserted; only an immense waste of low-growing reeds stretched far\naway to the very foot of the mountains. On the low bank, a little to\none side, could be seen the flat-roofed clay houses and the\nfunnel-shaped chimneys of a Ch\xc3\xa9chen village. The sharp eyes of the\nCossack who stood on the watch-tower followed, through the evening\nsmoke of the pro-Russian village, the tiny moving figures of the\nCh\xc3\xa9chen women visible in the distance in their red and blue garments.\n\nAlthough the Cossacks expected _abreks_ to cross over and attack them\nfrom the Tartar side at any moment, especially as it was May when the\nwoods by the T\xc3\xa9rek are so dense that it is difficult to pass through\nthem on foot and the river is shallow enough in places for a horseman\nto ford it, and despite the fact that a couple of days before a Cossack\nhad arrived with a circular from the commander of the regiment\nannouncing that spies had reported the intention of a party of some\neight men to cross the T\xc3\xa9rek, and ordering special vigilance\xe2\x80\x94no special\nvigilance was being observed in the cordon. The Cossacks, unarmed and\nwith their horses unsaddled just as if they were at home, spent their\ntime some in fishing, some in drinking, and some in hunting. Only the\nhorse of the man on duty was saddled, and with its feet hobbled was\nmoving about by the brambles near the wood, and only the sentinel had\nhis Circassian coat on and carried a gun and sword. The corporal, a\ntall thin Cossack with an exceptionally long back and small hands and\nfeet, was sitting on the earth-bank of a hut with his _beshmet_\nunbuttoned. On his face was the lazy, bored expression of a superior,\nand having shut his eyes he dropped his head upon the palm first of one\nhand and then of the other. An elderly Cossack with a broad\ngreyish-black beard was lying in his shirt, girdled with a black strap,\nclose to the river and gazing lazily at the waves of the T\xc3\xa9rek as they\nmonotonously foamed and swirled. Others, also overcome by the heat and\nhalf naked, were rinsing clothes in the T\xc3\xa9rek, plaiting a fishing line,\nor humming tunes as they lay on the hot sand of the river bank. One\nCossack, with a thin face much burnt by the sun, lay near the hut\nevidently dead drunk, by a wall which though it had been in shadow some\ntwo hours previously was now exposed to the sun\xe2\x80\x99s fierce slanting rays.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka, who stood on the watch-tower, was a tall handsome lad about\ntwenty years old and very like his mother. His face and whole build, in\nspite of the angularity of youth, indicated great strength, both\nphysical and moral. Though he had only lately joined the Cossacks at\nthe front, it was evident from the expression of his face and the calm\nassurance of his attitude that he had already acquired the somewhat\nproud and warlike bearing peculiar to Cossacks and to men generally who\ncontinually carry arms, and that he felt he was a Cossack and fully\nknew his own value. His ample Circassian coat was torn in some places,\nhis cap was on the back of his head Ch\xc3\xa9chen fashion, and his leggings\nhad slipped below his knees. His clothing was not rich, but he wore it\nwith that peculiar Cossack foppishness which consists in imitating the\nCh\xc3\xa9chen brave. Everything on a real brave is ample, ragged, and\nneglected, only his weapons are costly. But these ragged clothes and\nthese weapons are belted and worn with a certain air and matched in a\ncertain manner, neither of which can be acquired by everybody and which\nat once strike the eye of a Cossack or a hillsman. Luk\xc3\xa1shka had this\nresemblance to a brave. With his hands folded under his sword, and his\neyes nearly closed, he kept looking at the distant Tartar village.\nTaken separately his features were not beautiful, but anyone who saw\nhis stately carriage and his dark-browed intelligent face would\ninvoluntarily say, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fine fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at the women, what a lot of them are walking about in the\nvillage,\xe2\x80\x9d said he in a sharp voice, languidly showing his brilliant\nwhite teeth and not addressing anyone in particular.\n\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka who was lying below immediately lifted his head and remarked:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey must be going for water.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSupposing one scared them with a gun?\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, laughing,\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they be frightened?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t reach.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Mine would carry beyond. Just wait a bit, and when their feast\ncomes round I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and visit Gir\xc3\xa9y Khan and drink _buza_ there,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka, angrily swishing away the mosquitoes which attached\nthemselves to him.\n\nA rustling in the thicket drew the Cossack\xe2\x80\x99s attention. A pied mongrel\nhalf-setter, searching for a scent and violently wagging its scantily\nfurred tail, came running to the cordon. Luk\xc3\xa1shka recognized the dog as\none belonging to his neighbour, Uncle Er\xc3\xb3shka, a hunter, and saw,\nfollowing it through the thicket, the approaching figure of the hunter\nhimself.\n\nUncle Er\xc3\xb3shka was a gigantic Cossack with a broad, snow-white beard and\nsuch broad shoulders and chest that in the wood, where there was no one\nto compare him with, he did not look particularly tall, so well\nproportioned were his powerful limbs. He wore a tattered coat and, over\nthe bands with which his legs were swathed, sandals made of undressed\ndeer\xe2\x80\x99s hide tied on with strings; while on his head he had a rough\nlittle white cap. He carried over one shoulder a screen to hide behind\nwhen shooting pheasants, and a bag containing a hen for luring hawks,\nand a small falcon; over the other shoulder, attached by a strap, was a\nwild cat he had killed; and stuck in his belt behind were some little\nbags containing bullets, gunpowder, and bread, a horse\xe2\x80\x99s tail to swish\naway the mosquitoes, a large dagger in a torn scabbard smeared with old\nbloodstains, and two dead pheasants. Having glanced at the cordon he\nstopped.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHy, Lyam!\xe2\x80\x9d he called to the dog in such a ringing bass that it awoke\nan echo far away in the wood; and throwing over his shoulder his big\ngun, of the kind the Cossacks call a \xe2\x80\x9cflint\xe2\x80\x9d, he raised his cap.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad a good day, good people, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, addressing the Cossacks in\nthe same strong and cheerful voice, quite without effort, but as loudly\nas if he were shouting to someone on the other bank of the river.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, Uncle!\xe2\x80\x9d answered from all sides the voices of the young\nCossacks.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you seen? Tell us!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Uncle Er\xc3\xb3shka, wiping the sweat\nfrom his broad red face with the sleeve of his coat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, there\xe2\x80\x99s a vulture living in the plane tree here, Uncle. As soon as\nnight comes he begins hovering round,\xe2\x80\x9d said Naz\xc3\xa1rka, winking and\njerking his shoulder and leg.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man incredulously.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, Uncle! You must keep watch,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Naz\xc3\xa1rka with a laugh.\n\nThe other Cossacks began laughing.\n\nThe wag had not seen any vulture at all, but it had long been the\ncustom of the young Cossacks in the cordon to tease and mislead Uncle\nEr\xc3\xb3shka every time he came to them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, you fool, always lying!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Luk\xc3\xa1shka from the tower to\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka.\n\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka was immediately silenced.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be watched. I\xe2\x80\x99ll watch,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the old man to the great\ndelight of all the Cossacks. \xe2\x80\x9cBut have you seen any boars?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWatching for boars, are you?\xe2\x80\x9d said the corporal, bending forward and\nscratching his back with both hands, very pleased at the chance of some\ndistraction. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s _abreks_ one has to hunt here and not boars! You\xe2\x80\x99ve\nnot heard anything, Uncle, have you?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, needlessly screwing up\nhis eyes and showing his close-set white teeth.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Abreks_,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t. I say, have you any\n_chikhir?_ Let me have a drink, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good man. I\xe2\x80\x99m really quite\ndone up. When the time comes I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring you some fresh meat, I really\nwill. Give me a drink!\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and are you going to watch?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the corporal, as though he\nhad not heard what the other said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did mean to watch tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Uncle Er\xc3\xb3shka. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe, with\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s help, I shall kill something for the holiday. Then you shall have\na share, you shall indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle! Hallo, Uncle!\xe2\x80\x9d called out Luk\xc3\xa1shka sharply from above,\nattracting everybody\xe2\x80\x99s attention. All the Cossacks looked up at him.\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust go to the upper water-course, there\xe2\x80\x99s a fine herd of boars there.\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not inventing, really! The other day one of our Cossacks shot one\nthere. I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d added he, readjusting the musket at\nhis back and in a tone that showed he was not joking.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Luk\xc3\xa1shka the Snatcher is here!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, looking up.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere has he been shooting?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you seen? I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99re too young!\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka. \xe2\x80\x9cClose\nby the ditch,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on seriously with a shake of the head. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were\njust going along the ditch when all at once we heard something\ncrackling, but my gun was in its case. Elias fired suddenly ... But\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll show you the place, it\xe2\x80\x99s not far. You just wait a bit. I know\nevery one of their footpaths ... Daddy M\xc3\xb3sev,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, turning\nresolutely and almost commandingly to the corporal, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s time to\nrelieve guard!\xe2\x80\x9d and holding aloft his gun he began to descend from the\nwatch-tower without waiting for the order.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome down!\xe2\x80\x9d said the corporal, after Luk\xc3\xa1shka had started, and glanced\nround. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it your turn, G\xc3\xbarka? Then go ... True enough your Luk\xc3\xa1shka\nhas become very skilful,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, addressing the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cHe keeps\ngoing about just like you, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stay at home. The other day he\nkilled a boar.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n Chapter VII\n\n\nThe sun had already set and the shades of night were rapidly spreading\nfrom the edge of the wood. The Cossacks finished their task round the\ncordon and gathered in the hut for supper. Only the old man still\nstayed under the plane tree watching for the vulture and pulling the\nstring tied to the falcon\xe2\x80\x99s leg, but though a vulture was really\nperching on the plane tree it declined to swoop down on the lure.\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka, singing one song after another, was leisurely placing nets\namong the very thickest brambles to trap pheasants. In spite of his\ntall stature and big hands every kind of work, both rough and delicate,\nprospered under Luk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s fingers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo, Luke!\xe2\x80\x9d came Naz\xc3\xa1rka\xe2\x80\x99s shrill, sharp voice calling him from the\nthicket close by. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Cossacks have gone in to supper.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka, with a live pheasant under his arm, forced his way through the\nbrambles and emerged on the footpath.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, breaking off in his song, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere did you get that\ncock pheasant? I suppose it was in my trap?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka was of the same age as Luk\xc3\xa1shka and had also only been at the\nfront since the previous spring.\n\nHe was plain, thin and puny, with a shrill voice that rang in one\xe2\x80\x99s\nears. They were neighbours and comrades. Luk\xc3\xa1shka was sitting on the\ngrass cross-legged like a Tartar, adjusting his nets.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whose it was\xe2\x80\x94yours, I expect.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it beyond the pit by the plane tree? Then it is mine! I set the\nnets last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka rose and examined the captured pheasant. After stroking the\ndark burnished head of the bird, which rolled its eyes and stretched\nout its neck in terror, Luk\xc3\xa1shka took the pheasant in his hands.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll have it in a pilau tonight. You go and kill and pluck it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd shall we eat it ourselves or give it to the corporal?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has plenty!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like killing them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Naz\xc3\xa1rka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it here!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka drew a little knife from under his dagger and gave it a swift\njerk. The bird fluttered, but before it could spread its wings the\nbleeding head bent and quivered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s how one should do it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, throwing down the\npheasant. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will make a fat pilau.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka shuddered as he looked at the bird.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Luk\xc3\xa1shka, that fiend will be sending us to the ambush again\ntonight,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, taking up the bird. (He was alluding to the\ncorporal.) \xe2\x80\x9cHe has sent F\xc3\xb3mushkin to get wine, and it ought to be his\nturn. He always puts it on us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka went whistling along the cordon.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake the string with you,\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted.\n\nNazirka obeyed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll give him a bit of my mind today, I really will,\xe2\x80\x9d continued\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s say we won\xe2\x80\x99t go; we\xe2\x80\x99re tired out and there\xe2\x80\x99s an end of\nit! No, really, you tell him, he\xe2\x80\x99ll listen to you. It\xe2\x80\x99s too bad!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet along with you! What a thing to make a fuss about!\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka,\nevidently thinking of something else. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat bosh! If he made us turn\nout of the village at night now, that would be annoying: there one can\nhave some fun, but here what is there? It\xe2\x80\x99s all one whether we\xe2\x80\x99re in\nthe cordon or in ambush. What a fellow you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are you going to the village?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go for the holidays.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cG\xc3\xbarka says your Dun\xc3\xa1yka is carrying on with F\xc3\xb3mushkin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Naz\xc3\xa1rka\nsuddenly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let her go to the devil,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, showing his regular\nwhite teeth, though he did not laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cAs if I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find another!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cG\xc3\xbarka says he went to her house. Her husband was out and there was\nF\xc3\xb3mushkin sitting and eating pie. G\xc3\xbarka stopped awhile and then went\naway, and passing by the window he heard her say, \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s gone, the\nfiend.... Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you eat your pie, my own? You needn\xe2\x80\x99t go home for\nthe night,\xe2\x80\x99 she says. And G\xc3\xbarka under the window says to himself,\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s fine!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re making it up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, quite true, by Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if she\xe2\x80\x99s found another let her go to the devil,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka,\nafter a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no lack of girls and I was sick of her anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, see what a devil you are!\xe2\x80\x9d said Naz\xc3\xa1rka. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should make up to\nthe cornet\xe2\x80\x99s girl, Mary\xc3\xa1nka. Why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t she walk out with any one?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka frowned. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat of Mary\xc3\xa1nka? They\xe2\x80\x99re all alike,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you just try...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think? Are girls so scarce in the village?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Luk\xc3\xa1shka recommenced whistling, and went along the cordon pulling\nleaves and branches from the bushes as he went. Suddenly, catching\nsight of a smooth sapling, he drew the knife from the handle of his\ndagger and cut it down. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a ramrod it will make,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, swinging\nthe sapling till it whistled through the air.\n\nThe Cossacks were sitting round a low Tartar table on the earthen floor\nof the clay-plastered outer room of the hut, when the question of whose\nturn it was to lie in ambush was raised. \xe2\x80\x9cWho is to go tonight?\xe2\x80\x9d\nshouted one of the Cossacks through the open door to the corporal in\nthe next room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is to go?\xe2\x80\x9d the corporal shouted back. \xe2\x80\x9cUncle Burl\xc3\xa1k has been and\nF\xc3\xb3mushkin too,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, not quite confidently. \xe2\x80\x9cYou two had better go,\nyou and Naz\xc3\xa1rka,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, addressing Luk\xc3\xa1shka. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Ergush\xc3\xb3v must\ngo too; surely he has slept it off?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t sleep it off yourself so why should he?\xe2\x80\x9d said Naz\xc3\xa1rka in a\nsubdued voice.\n\nThe Cossacks laughed.\n\nErgush\xc3\xb3v was the Cossack who had been lying drunk and asleep near the\nhut. He had only that moment staggered into the room rubbing his eyes.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka had already risen and was getting his gun ready.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe quick and go! Finish your supper and go!\xe2\x80\x9d said the corporal; and\nwithout waiting for an expression of consent he shut the door,\nevidently not expecting the Cossack to obey. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he,\n\xe2\x80\x9cif I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been ordered to I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t send anyone, but an officer\nmight turn up at any moment. As it is, they say eight _abreks_ have\ncrossed over.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I suppose I must go,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Ergush\xc3\xb3v, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s the regulation.\nCan\xe2\x80\x99t be helped! The times are such. I say, we must go.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMeanwhile Luk\xc3\xa1shka, holding a big piece of pheasant to his mouth with\nboth hands and glancing now at Naz\xc3\xa1rka, now at Ergush\xc3\xb3v, seemed quite\nindifferent to what passed and only laughed at them both. Before the\nCossacks were ready to go into ambush. Uncle Er\xc3\xb3shka, who had been\nvainly waiting under the plane tree till night fell, entered the dark\nouter room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, lads,\xe2\x80\x9d his loud bass resounded through the low-roofed room\ndrowning all the other voices, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going with you. You\xe2\x80\x99ll watch for\nCh\xc3\xa9chens and I for boars!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n Chapter VIII\n\n\nIt was quite dark when Uncle Er\xc3\xb3shka and the three Cossacks, in their\ncloaks and shouldering their guns, left the cordon and went towards the\nplace on the T\xc3\xa9rek where they were to lie in ambush. Naz\xc3\xa1rka did not\nwant to go at all, but Luk\xc3\xa1shka shouted at him and they soon started.\nAfter they had gone a few steps in silence the Cossacks turned aside\nfrom the ditch and went along a path almost hidden by reeds till they\nreached the river. On its bank lay a thick black log cast up by the\nwater. The reeds around it had been recently beaten down.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we lie here?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Naz\xc3\xa1rka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d answered Luk\xc3\xa1shka. \xe2\x80\x9cSit down here and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be back in a\nminute. I\xe2\x80\x99ll only show Daddy where to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the best place; here we can see and not be seen,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nErgush\xc3\xb3v, \xe2\x80\x9cso it\xe2\x80\x99s here we\xe2\x80\x99ll lie. It\xe2\x80\x99s a first-rate place!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka and Ergush\xc3\xb3v spread out their cloaks and settled down behind\nthe log, while Luk\xc3\xa1shka went on with Uncle Er\xc3\xb3shka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not far from here. Daddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, stepping softly in\nfront of the old man; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll show you where they\xe2\x80\x99ve been\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m the only\none that knows, Daddy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow me! You\xe2\x80\x99re a fine fellow, a regular Snatcher!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old\nman, also whispering.\n\nHaving gone a few steps Luk\xc3\xa1shka stopped, stooped down over a puddle,\nand whistled. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s where they come to drink, d\xe2\x80\x99you see?\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke in\na scarcely audible voice, pointing to fresh hoof-prints.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cChrist bless you,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cThe boar will be in the\nhollow beyond the ditch,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll watch, and you can go.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka pulled his cloak up higher and walked back alone, throwing\nswift glances now to the left at the wall of reeds, now to the T\xc3\xa9rek\nrushing by below the bank. \xe2\x80\x9cI daresay he\xe2\x80\x99s watching or creeping along\nsomewhere,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he of a possible Ch\xc3\xa9chen hillsman. Suddenly a loud\nrustling and a splash in the water made him start and seize his musket.\nFrom under the bank a boar leapt up\xe2\x80\x94his dark outline showing for a\nmoment against the glassy surface of the water and then disappearing\namong the reeds. Luk\xc3\xa1shka pulled out his gun and aimed, but before he\ncould fire the boar had disappeared in the thicket. Luk\xc3\xa1shka spat with\nvexation and went on. On approaching the ambuscade he halted again and\nwhistled softly. His whistle was answered and he stepped up to his\ncomrades.\n\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka, all curled up, was already asleep. Ergush\xc3\xb3v sat with his legs\ncrossed and moved slightly to make room for Luk\xc3\xa1shka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow jolly it is to sit here! It\xe2\x80\x99s really a good place,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cDid\nyou take him there?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShowed him where,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Luk\xc3\xa1shka, spreading out his cloak. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\nwhat a big boar I roused just now close to the water! I expect it was\nthe very one! You must have heard the crash?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did hear a beast crashing through. I knew at once it was a beast. I\nthought to myself: \xe2\x80\x98Luk\xc3\xa1shka has roused a beast,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Ergush\xc3\xb3v said,\nwrapping himself up in his cloak. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWake me when the cocks crow. We must have discipline. I\xe2\x80\x99ll lie down\nand have a nap, and then you will have a nap and I\xe2\x80\x99ll watch\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the\nway.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLuckily I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Luk\xc3\xa1shka.\n\nThe night was dark, warm, and still. Only on one side of the sky the\nstars were shining, the other and greater part was overcast by one huge\ncloud stretching from the mountaintops. The black cloud, blending in\nthe absence of any wind with the mountains, moved slowly onwards, its\ncurved edges sharply defined against the deep starry sky. Only in front\nof him could the Cossack discern the T\xc3\xa9rek and the distance beyond.\nBehind and on both sides he was surrounded by a wall of reeds.\nOccasionally the reeds would sway and rustle against one another\napparently without cause. Seen from down below, against the clear part\nof the sky, their waving tufts looked like the feathery branches of\ntrees. Close in front at his very feet was the bank, and at its base\nthe rushing torrent. A little farther on was the moving mass of glassy\nbrown water which eddied rhythmically along the bank and round the\nshallows. Farther still, water, banks, and cloud all merged together in\nimpenetrable gloom. Along the surface of the water floated black\nshadows, in which the experienced eyes of the Cossack detected trees\ncarried down by the current. Only very rarely sheet-lightning, mirrored\nin the water as in a black glass, disclosed the sloping bank opposite.\nThe rhythmic sounds of night\xe2\x80\x94the rustling of the reeds, the snoring of\nthe Cossacks, the hum of mosquitoes, and the rushing water, were every\nnow and then broken by a shot fired in the distance, or by the gurgling\nof water when a piece of bank slipped down, the splash of a big fish,\nor the crashing of an animal breaking through the thick undergrowth in\nthe wood. Once an owl flew past along the T\xc3\xa9rek, flapping one wing\nagainst the other rhythmically at every second beat. Just above the\nCossack\xe2\x80\x99s head it turned towards the wood and then, striking its wings\nno longer after every other flap but at every flap, it flew to an old\nplane tree where it rustled about for a long time before settling down\namong the branches. At every one of these unexpected sounds the\nwatching Cossack listened intently, straining his hearing, and screwing\nup his eyes while he deliberately felt for his musket.\n\nThe greater part of the night was past. The black cloud that had moved\nwestward revealed the clear starry sky from under its torn edge, and\nthe golden upturned crescent of the moon shone above the mountains with\na reddish light. The cold began to be penetrating. Naz\xc3\xa1rka awoke, spoke\na little, and fell asleep again. Luk\xc3\xa1shka feeling bored got up, drew\nthe knife from his dagger-handle and began to fashion his stick into a\nramrod. His head was full of the Ch\xc3\xa9chens who lived over there in the\nmountains, and of how their brave lads came across and were not afraid\nof the Cossacks, and might even now be crossing the river at some other\nspot. He thrust himself out of his hiding-place and looked along the\nriver but could see nothing. And as he continued looking out at\nintervals upon the river and at the opposite bank, now dimly\ndistinguishable from the water in the faint moonlight, he no longer\nthought about the Ch\xc3\xa9chens but only of when it would be time to wake\nhis comrades, and of going home to the village. In the village he\nimagined Dun\xc3\xa1yka, his \xe2\x80\x9clittle soul\xe2\x80\x9d, as the Cossacks call a man\xe2\x80\x99s\nmistress, and thought of her with vexation. Silvery mists, a sign of\ncoming morning, glittered white above the water, and not far from him\nyoung eagles were whistling and flapping their wings. At last the\ncrowing of a cock reached him from the distant village, followed by the\nlong-sustained note of another, which was again answered by yet other\nvoices.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTime to wake them,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Luk\xc3\xa1shka, who had finished his ramrod and\nfelt his eyes growing heavy. Turning to his comrades he managed to make\nout which pair of legs belonged to whom, when it suddenly seemed to him\nthat he heard something splash on the other side of the T\xc3\xa9rek. He\nturned again towards the horizon beyond the hills, where day was\nbreaking under the upturned crescent, glanced at the outline of the\nopposite bank, at the T\xc3\xa9rek, and at the now distinctly visible\ndriftwood upon it. For one instant it seemed to him that he was moving\nand that the T\xc3\xa9rek with the drifting wood remained stationary. Again he\npeered out. One large black log with a branch particularly attracted\nhis attention. The tree was floating in a strange way right down the\nmiddle of the stream, neither rocking nor whirling. It even appeared\nnot to be floating altogether with the current, but to be crossing it\nin the direction of the shallows. Luk\xc3\xa1shka stretching out his neck\nwatched it intently. The tree floated to the shallows, stopped, and\nshifted in a peculiar manner. Luk\xc3\xa1shka thought he saw an arm stretched\nout from beneath the tree.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSupposing I killed an _abrek_ all by myself!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, and seized\nhis gun with a swift, unhurried movement, putting up his gun-rest,\nplacing the gun upon it, and holding it noiselessly in position.\nCocking the trigger, with bated breath he took aim, still peering out\nintently.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t wake them,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. But his heart began beating so fast\nthat he remained motionless, listening. Suddenly the trunk gave a\nplunge and again began to float across the stream towards our bank.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose I miss?...\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, and now by the faint light of the moon\nhe caught a glimpse of a Tartar\xe2\x80\x99s head in front of the floating wood.\nHe aimed straight at the head which appeared to be quite near\xe2\x80\x94just at\nthe end of his rifle\xe2\x80\x99s barrel. He glanced cross. \xe2\x80\x9cRight enough it is an\n_abrek!_\xe2\x80\x9d he thought joyfully, and suddenly rising to his knees he\nagain took aim. Having found the sight, barely visible at the end of\nthe long gun, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the name of the Father and of the Son,\xe2\x80\x9d in\nthe Cossack way learnt in his childhood, and pulled the trigger. A\nflash of lightning lit up for an instant the reeds and the water, and\nthe sharp, abrupt report of the shot was carried across the river,\nchanging into a prolonged roll somewhere in the far distance. The piece\nof driftwood now floated not across, but with the current, rocking and\nwhirling.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, I say!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Ergush\xc3\xb3v, seizing his musket and raising\nhimself behind the log near which he was lying.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut up, you devil!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Luk\xc3\xa1shka, grinding his teeth.\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Abreks!_\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhom have you shot?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Naz\xc3\xa1rka. \xe2\x80\x9cWho was it, Luk\xc3\xa1shka?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka did not answer. He was reloading his gun and watching the\nfloating wood. A little way off it stopped on a sand-bank, and from\nbehind it something large that rocked in the water came into view.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you shoot? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you speak?\xe2\x80\x9d insisted the Cossacks.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Abreks_, I tell you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t humbug! Did the gun go off? ...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve killed an _abrek_, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I fired at,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Luk\xc3\xa1shka in\na voice choked by emotion, as he jumped to his feet. \xe2\x80\x9cA man was\nswimming...\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pointing to the sandbank. \xe2\x80\x9cI killed him. Just\nlook there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave done with your humbugging!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ergush\xc3\xb3v again, rubbing his\neyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave done with what? Look there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, seizing him by the\nshoulders and pulling him with such force that Ergush\xc3\xb3v groaned.\n\nHe looked in the direction in which Luk\xc3\xa1shka pointed, and discerning a\nbody immediately changed his tone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Lord! But I say, more will come! I tell you the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d said he\nsoftly, and began examining his musket. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was a scout swimming\nacross: either the others are here already or are not far off on the\nother side\xe2\x80\x94I tell you for sure!\xe2\x80\x9d Luk\xc3\xa1shka was unfastening his belt and\ntaking off his Circassian coat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you up to, you idiot?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Ergush\xc3\xb3v. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly show\nyourself and you\xe2\x80\x99ve lost all for nothing, I tell you true! If you\xe2\x80\x99ve\nkilled him he won\xe2\x80\x99t escape. Let me have a little powder for my\nmusket-pan\xe2\x80\x94you have some? Naz\xc3\xa1rka, you go back to the cordon and look\nalive; but don\xe2\x80\x99t go along the bank or you\xe2\x80\x99ll be killed\xe2\x80\x94I tell you\ntrue.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCatch me going alone! Go yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d said Naz\xc3\xa1rka angrily.\n\nHaving taken off his coat, Luk\xc3\xa1shka went down to the bank.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go in, I tell you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ergush\xc3\xb3v, putting some powder on the\npan. \xe2\x80\x9cLook, he\xe2\x80\x99s not moving. I can see. It\xe2\x80\x99s nearly morning; wait till\nthey come from the cordon. You go, Naz\xc3\xa1rka. You\xe2\x80\x99re afraid! Don\xe2\x80\x99t be\nafraid, I tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLuke, I say, Luk\xc3\xa1shka! Tell us how you did it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Naz\xc3\xa1rka.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka changed his mind about going into the water just then. \xe2\x80\x9cGo\nquick to the cordon and I will watch. Tell the Cossacks to send out the\npatrol. If the _abreks_ are on this side they must be caught,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I say. They\xe2\x80\x99ll get off,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ergush\xc3\xb3v, rising. \xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\nthey must be caught!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nErgush\xc3\xb3v and Naz\xc3\xa1rka rose and, crossing themselves, started off for the\ncordon\xe2\x80\x94not along the riverbank but breaking their way through the\nbrambles to reach a path in the wood.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow mind, Luk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x94they may cut you down here, so you\xe2\x80\x99d best keep a\nsharp look-out, I tell you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo along; I know,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Luk\xc3\xa1shka; and having examined his gun\nagain he sat down behind the log.\n\nHe remained alone and sat gazing at the shallows and listening for the\nCossacks; but it was some distance to the cordon and he was tormented\nby impatience. He kept thinking that the other _abreks_ who were with\nthe one he had killed would escape. He was vexed with the _abreks_ who\nwere going to escape just as he had been with the boar that had escaped\nthe evening before. He glanced round and at the opposite bank,\nexpecting every moment to see a man, and having arranged his gun-rest\nhe was ready to fire. The idea that he might himself be killed never\nentered his head.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter IX\n\n\nIt was growing light. The Ch\xc3\xa9chen\xe2\x80\x99s body which was gently rocking in\nthe shallow water was now clearly visible. Suddenly the reeds rustled\nnot far from Luke and he heard steps and saw the feathery tops of the\nreeds moving. He set his gun at full cock and muttered: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the name of\nthe Father and of the Son,\xe2\x80\x9d but when the cock clicked the sound of\nsteps ceased.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo, Cossacks! Don\xe2\x80\x99t kill your Daddy!\xe2\x80\x9d said a deep bass voice\ncalmly; and moving the reeds apart Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka came up close to Luke.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI very nearly killed you, by God I did!\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you shot?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the old man.\n\nHis sonorous voice resounded through the wood and downward along the\nriver, suddenly dispelling the mysterious quiet of night around the\nCossack. It was as if everything had suddenly become lighter and more\ndistinct.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now. Uncle, you have not seen anything, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve killed a\nbeast,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, uncocking his gun and getting up with unnatural\ncalmness.\n\nThe old man was staring intently at the white back, now clearly\nvisible, against which the T\xc3\xa9rek rippled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was swimming with a log on his back. I spied him out! ... Look\nthere. There! He\xe2\x80\x99s got blue trousers, and a gun I think.... Do you\nsee?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Luke.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can one help seeing?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man angrily, and a serious and\nstern expression appeared on his face. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve killed a brave,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid, apparently with regret.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I sat here and suddenly saw something dark on the other side. I\nspied him when he was still over there. It was as if a man had come\nthere and fallen in. Strange! And a piece of driftwood, a good-sized\npiece, comes floating, not with the stream but across it; and what do I\nsee but a head appearing from under it! Strange! I stretched out of the\nreeds but could see nothing; then I rose and he must have heard, the\nbeast, and crept out into the shallow and looked about. \xe2\x80\x98No, you\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99 I said, as soon as he landed and looked round, \xe2\x80\x98you won\xe2\x80\x99t get\naway!\xe2\x80\x99 Oh, there was something choking me! I got my gun ready but did\nnot stir, and looked out. He waited a little and then swam out again;\nand when he came into the moonlight I could see his whole back. \xe2\x80\x98In the\nname of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost\xe2\x80\x99... and through\nthe smoke I see him struggling. He moaned, or so it seemed to me. \xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99\nI thought, \xe2\x80\x98the Lord be thanked, I\xe2\x80\x99ve killed him!\xe2\x80\x99 And when he drifted\nonto the sand-bank I could see him distinctly: he tried to get up but\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. He struggled a bit and then lay down. Everything could be\nseen. Look, he does not move\xe2\x80\x94he must be dead! The Cossacks have gone\nback to the cordon in case there should be any more of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you got him!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is far away now, my lad!\n...\xe2\x80\x9d And again he shook his head sadly.\n\nJust then the sound reached them of breaking bushes and the loud voices\nof Cossacks approaching along the bank on horseback and on foot. \xe2\x80\x9cAre\nyou bringing the skiff?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Luk\xc3\xa1shka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a trump, Luke! Lug it to the bank!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted one of the\nCossacks.\n\nWithout waiting for the skiff Luk\xc3\xa1shka began to undress, keeping an eye\nall the while on his prey.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit, Naz\xc3\xa1rka is bringing the skiff,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the corporal.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou fool! Maybe he is alive and only pretending! Take your dagger with\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted another Cossack.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet along,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Luke, pulling off his trousers. He quickly undressed\nand, crossing himself, jumped, plunging with a splash into the river.\nThen with long strokes of his white arms, lifting his back high out of\nthe water and breathing deeply, he swam across the current of the T\xc3\xa9rek\ntowards the shallows. A crowd of Cossacks stood on the bank talking\nloudly. Three horsemen rode off to patrol. The skiff appeared round a\nbend. Luk\xc3\xa1shka stood up on the sandbank, leaned over the body, and gave\nit a couple of shakes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite dead!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted in a shrill voice.\n\nThe Ch\xc3\xa9chen had been shot in the head. He had on a pair of blue\ntrousers, a shirt, and a Circassian coat, and a gun and dagger were\ntied to his back. Above all these a large branch was tied, and it was\nthis which at first had misled Luk\xc3\xa1shka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a carp you\xe2\x80\x99ve landed!\xe2\x80\x9d cried one of the Cossacks who had\nassembled in a circle, as the body, lifted out of the skiff, was laid\non the bank, pressing down the grass.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow yellow he is!\xe2\x80\x9d said another.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere have our fellows gone to search? I expect the rest of them are\non the other bank. If this one had not been a scout he would not have\nswum that way. Why else should he swim alone?\xe2\x80\x9d said a third.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust have been a smart one to offer himself before the others; a\nregular brave!\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka mockingly, shivering as he wrung out his\nclothes that had got wet on the bank.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis beard is dyed and cropped.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he has tied a bag with a coat in it to his back.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would make it easier for him to swim,\xe2\x80\x9d said some one.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Luk\xc3\xa1shka,\xe2\x80\x9d said the corporal, who was holding the dagger and\ngun taken from the dead man. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep the dagger for yourself and the coat\ntoo; but I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you three rubles for the gun. You see it has a hole\nin it,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, blowing into the muzzle. \xe2\x80\x9cI want it just for a\nsouvenir.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka did not answer. Evidently this sort of begging vexed him but\nhe knew it could not be avoided.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, what a devil!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, frowning and throwing down the Ch\xc3\xa9chen\xe2\x80\x99s\ncoat. \xe2\x80\x9cIf at least it were a good coat, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a mere rag.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll do to fetch firewood in,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the Cossacks.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cM\xc3\xb3sev, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, evidently forgetting his vexation\nand wishing to get some advantage out of having to give a present to\nhis superior.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, you may go!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake the body beyond the cordon, lads,\xe2\x80\x9d said the corporal, still\nexamining the gun, \xe2\x80\x9cand put a shelter over him from the sun. Perhaps\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ll send from the mountains to ransom it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t hot yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said someone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd supposing a jackal tears him? Would that be well?\xe2\x80\x9d remarked\nanother Cossack.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll set a watch; if they should come to ransom him it won\xe2\x80\x99t do for\nhim to have been torn.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Luk\xc3\xa1shka, whatever you do you must stand a pail of vodka for the\nlads,\xe2\x80\x9d said the corporal gaily.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course! That\xe2\x80\x99s the custom,\xe2\x80\x9d chimed in the Cossacks. \xe2\x80\x9cSee what luck\nGod has sent you! Without ever having seen anything of the kind before,\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve killed a brave!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBuy the dagger and coat and don\xe2\x80\x99t be stingy, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you have the\ntrousers too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re too tight for me; he was a thin\ndevil.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOne Cossack bought the coat for a ruble and another gave the price of\ntwo pails of vodka for the dagger.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrink, lads! I\xe2\x80\x99ll stand you a pail!\xe2\x80\x9d said Luke. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll bring it myself\nfrom the village.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd cut up the trousers into kerchiefs for the girls!\xe2\x80\x9d said Naz\xc3\xa1rka.\n\nThe Cossacks burst out laughing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave done laughing!\xe2\x80\x9d said the corporal. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd take the body away. Why\nhave you put the nasty thing by the hut?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you standing there for? Haul him along, lads!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka in a commanding voice to the Cossacks, who reluctantly took\nhold of the body, obeying him as though he were their chief. After\ndragging the body along for a few steps the Cossacks let fall the legs,\nwhich dropped with a lifeless jerk, and stepping apart they then stood\nsilent for a few moments. Naz\xc3\xa1rka came up and straightened the head,\nwhich was turned to one side so that the round wound above the temple\nand the whole of the dead man\xe2\x80\x99s face were visible. \xe2\x80\x9cSee what a mark he\nhas made right in the brain,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe won\xe2\x80\x99t get lost. His owners\nwill always know him!\xe2\x80\x9d No one answered, and again the Angel of Silence\nflew over the Cossacks.\n\nThe sun had risen high and its diverging beams were lighting up the\ndewy grass. Near by, the T\xc3\xa9rek murmured in the awakened wood and,\ngreeting the morning, the pheasants called to one another. The Cossacks\nstood still and silent around the dead man, gazing at him. The brown\nbody, with nothing on but the wet blue trousers held by a girdle over\nthe sunken stomach, was well shaped and handsome. The muscular arms lay\nstretched straight out by his sides; the blue, freshly shaven, round\nhead with the clotted wound on one side of it was thrown back. The\nsmooth tanned forehead contrasted sharply with the shaven part of the\nhead. The open glassy eyes with lowered pupils stared upwards, seeming\nto gaze past everything. Under the red trimmed moustache the fine lips,\ndrawn at the corners, seemed stiffened into a smile of good-natured\nsubtle raillery. The fingers of the small hands covered with red hairs\nwere bent inward, and the nails were dyed red.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka had not yet dressed. He was wet. His neck was redder and his\neyes brighter than usual, his broad jaws twitched, and from his healthy\nbody a hardly perceptible steam rose in the fresh morning air.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe too was a man!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, evidently admiring the corpse.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if you had fallen into his hands you would have had short\nshrift,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the Cossacks.\n\nThe Angel of Silence had taken wing. The Cossacks began bustling about\nand talking. Two of them went to cut brushwood for a shelter, others\nstrolled towards the cordon. Luke and Naz\xc3\xa1rka ran to get ready to go to\nthe village.\n\nHalf an hour later they were both on their way homewards, talking\nincessantly and almost running through the dense woods which separated\nthe T\xc3\xa9rek from the village.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell her I sent you, but just go and find out if her\nhusband is at home,\xe2\x80\x9d Luke was saying in his shrill voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ll go round to Y\xc3\xa1mka too,\xe2\x80\x9d said the devoted Naz\xc3\xa1rka. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll have\na spree, shall we?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen should we have one if not today?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Luke.\n\nWhen they reached the village the two Cossacks drank, and lay down to\nsleep till evening.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter X\n\n\nOn the third day after the events above described, two companies of a\nCaucasian infantry regiment arrived at the Cossack village of\nNovoml\xc3\xadnsk. The horses had been unharnessed and the companies\xe2\x80\x99 wagons\nwere standing in the square. The cooks had dug a pit, and with logs\ngathered from various yards (where they had not been sufficiently\nsecurely stored) were now cooking the food; the pay-sergeants were\nsettling accounts with the soldiers. The Service Corps men were driving\npiles in the ground to which to tie the horses, and the quartermasters\nwere going about the streets just as if they were at home, showing\nofficers and men to their quarters. Here were green ammunition boxes in\na line, the company\xe2\x80\x99s carts, horses, and cauldrons in which buckwheat\nporridge was being cooked.\n\nHere were the captain and the lieutenant and the sergeant-major, Onisim\nMikh\xc3\xa1ylovich, and all this was in the Cossack village where it was\nreported that the companies were ordered to take up their quarters:\ntherefore they were at home here.\n\nBut why they were stationed there, who the Cossacks were, and whether\nthey wanted the troops to be there, and whether they were Old Believers\nor not\xe2\x80\x94was all quite immaterial. Having received their pay and been\ndismissed, tired out and covered with dust, the soldiers noisily and in\ndisorder, like a swarm of bees about to settle, spread over the squares\nand streets.\n\nQuite regardless of the Cossacks\xe2\x80\x99 ill will, chattering merrily and with\ntheir muskets clinking, by twos and threes they entered the huts and\nhung up their accoutrements, unpacked their bags, and bantered the\nwomen. At their favourite spot, round the porridge-cauldrons, a large\ngroup of soldiers assembled and with little pipes between their teeth\nthey gazed, now at the smoke which rose into the hot sky, becoming\nvisible when it thickened into white clouds as it rose, and now at the\ncamp fires which were quivering in the pure air like molten glass, and\nbantered and made fun of the Cossack men and women because they do not\nlive at all like Russians. In all the yards one could see soldiers and\nhear their laughter and the exasperated and shrill cries of Cossack\nwomen defending their houses and refusing to give the soldiers water or\ncooking utensils. Little boys and girls, clinging to their mothers and\nto each other, followed all the movements of the troopers (never before\nseen by them) with frightened curiosity, or ran after them at a\nrespectful distance.\n\nThe old Cossacks came out silently and dismally and sat on the earthen\nembankments of their huts, and watched the soldiers\xe2\x80\x99 activity with an\nair of leaving it all to the will of God without understanding what\nwould come of it.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin, who had joined the Caucasian Army as a cadet three months\nbefore, was quartered in one of the best houses in the village, the\nhouse of the cornet, Elias Vas\xc3\xadlich\xe2\x80\x94that is to say at Granny Ul\xc3\xadtka\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness knows what it will be like, Dm\xc3\xadtri Andr\xc3\xa9ich,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\npanting Vany\xc3\xbasha to Ol\xc3\xa9nin, who, dressed in a Circassian coat and\nmounted on a Kabard\xc3\xa1 horse which he had bought in Gr\xc3\xb3znoe, was after a\nfive-hours\xe2\x80\x99 march gaily entering the yard of the quarters assigned to\nhim.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, caressing his horse and looking\nmerrily at the perspiring, dishevelled, and worried Vany\xc3\xbasha, who had\narrived with the baggage wagons and was unpacking.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin looked quite a different man. In place of his clean-shaven lips\nand chin he had a youthful moustache and a small beard. Instead of a\nsallow complexion, the result of nights turned into day, his cheeks,\nhis forehead, and the skin behind his ears were now red with healthy\nsunburn. In place of a clean new black suit he wore a dirty white\nCircassian coat with a deeply pleated skirt, and he bore arms. Instead\nof a freshly starched collar, his neck was tightly clasped by the red\nband of his silk _beshmet_. He wore Circassian dress but did not wear\nit well, and anyone would have known him for a Russian and not a Tartar\nbrave. It was the thing\xe2\x80\x94but not the real thing. But for all that, his\nwhole person breathed health, joy, and satisfaction.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it seems funny to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vany\xc3\xbasha, \xe2\x80\x9cbut just try to talk to\nthese people yourself: they set themselves against one and there\xe2\x80\x99s an\nend of it. You can\xe2\x80\x99t get as much as a word out of them.\xe2\x80\x9d Vany\xc3\xbasha\nangrily threw down a pail on the threshold. \xe2\x80\x9cSomehow they don\xe2\x80\x99t seem\nlike Russians.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should speak to the Chief of the Village!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where he lives,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vany\xc3\xbasha in an offended tone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho has upset you so?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin, looking round.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil only knows. Faugh! There is no real master here. They say he\nhas gone to some kind of _kriga_, and the old woman is a real devil.\nGod preserve us!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Vany\xc3\xbasha, putting his hands to his head.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow we shall live here I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. They are worse than Tartars, I do\ndeclare\xe2\x80\x94though they consider themselves Christians! A Tartar is bad\nenough, but all the same he is more noble. Gone to the _kriga_ indeed!\nWhat this _kriga_ they have invented is, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know!\xe2\x80\x9d concluded\nVany\xc3\xbasha, and turned aside.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not as it is in the serfs\xe2\x80\x99 quarters at home, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d chaffed Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nwithout dismounting.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease sir, may I have your horse?\xe2\x80\x9d said Vany\xc3\xbasha, evidently perplexed\nby this new order of things but resigning himself to his fate.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo a Tartar is more noble, eh, Vany\xc3\xbasha?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Ol\xc3\xa9nin, dismounting\nand slapping the saddle.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you\xe2\x80\x99re laughing! You think it funny,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Vany\xc3\xbasha angrily.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, don\xe2\x80\x99t be angry, Vany\xc3\xbasha,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ol\xc3\xa9nin, still smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cWait\na minute, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and speak to the people of the house; you\xe2\x80\x99ll see I\nshall arrange everything. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a jolly life we shall\nhave here. Only don\xe2\x80\x99t get upset.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nVany\xc3\xbasha did not answer. Screwing up his eyes he looked contemptuously\nafter his master, and shook his head. Vany\xc3\xbasha regarded Ol\xc3\xa9nin as only\nhis master, and Ol\xc3\xa9nin regarded Vany\xc3\xbasha as only his servant; and they\nwould both have been much surprised if anyone had told them that they\nwere friends, as they really were without knowing it themselves.\nVany\xc3\xbasha had been taken into his proprietor\xe2\x80\x99s house when he was only\neleven and when Ol\xc3\xa9nin was the same age. When Ol\xc3\xa9nin was fifteen he\ngave Vany\xc3\xbasha lessons for a time and taught him to read French, of\nwhich the latter was inordinately proud; and when in specially good\nspirits he still let off French words, always laughing stupidly when he\ndid so.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin ran up the steps of the porch and pushed open the door of the\nhut. Mary\xc3\xa1nka, wearing nothing but a pink smock, as all Cossack women\ndo in the house, jumped away from the door, frightened, and pressing\nherself against the wall covered the lower part of her face with the\nbroad sleeve of her Tartar smock. Having opened the door wider, Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nin the semi-darkness of the passage saw the whole tall, shapely figure\nof the young Cossack girl. With the quick and eager curiosity of youth\nhe involuntarily noticed the firm maidenly form revealed by the fine\nprint smock, and the beautiful black eyes fixed on him with childlike\nterror and wild curiosity.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is _she_,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Ol\xc3\xa9nin. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there will be many others like\nher\xe2\x80\x9d came at once into his head, and he opened the inner door.\n\nOld Granny Ul\xc3\xadtka, also dressed only in a smock, was stooping with her\nback turned to him, sweeping the floor.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-day to you. Mother! I\xe2\x80\x99ve come about my lodgings,\xe2\x80\x9d he began.\n\nThe Cossack woman, without unbending, turned her severe but still\nhandsome face towards him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you come here for? Want to mock at us, eh? I\xe2\x80\x99ll teach you to\nmock; may the black plague seize you!\xe2\x80\x9d she shouted, looking askance\nfrom under her frowning brow at the new-comer.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin had at first imagined that the way-worn, gallant Caucasian Army\n(of which he was a member) would be everywhere received joyfully, and\nespecially by the Cossacks, our comrades in the war; and he therefore\nfelt perplexed by this reception. Without losing presence of mind\nhowever he tried to explain that he meant to pay for his lodgings, but\nthe old woman would not give him a hearing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you come for? Who wants a pest like you, with your scraped\nface? You just wait a bit; when the master returns he\xe2\x80\x99ll show you your\nplace. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want your dirty money! A likely thing\xe2\x80\x94just as if we had\nnever seen any! You\xe2\x80\x99ll stink the house out with your beastly tobacco\nand want to put it right with money! Think we\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen a pest! May\nyou be shot in your bowels and your heart!\xe2\x80\x9d shrieked the old woman in a\npiercing voice, interrupting Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems Vany\xc3\xbasha was right!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Ol\xc3\xa9nin. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98A Tartar would be\nnobler\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d and followed by Granny Ul\xc3\xadtka\xe2\x80\x99s abuse he went out of the hut.\nAs he was leaving, Mary\xc3\xa1nka, still wearing only her pink smock, but\nwith her forehead covered down to her eyes by a white kerchief,\nsuddenly slipped out from the passage past him. Pattering rapidly down\nthe steps with her bare feet she ran from the porch, stopped, and\nlooking round hastily with laughing eyes at the young man, vanished\nround the corner of the hut.\n\nHer firm youthful step, the untamed look of the eyes glistening from\nunder the white kerchief, and the firm stately build of the young\nbeauty, struck Ol\xc3\xa9nin even more powerfully than before. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, it must\nbe _she_,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, and troubling his head still less about the\nlodgings, he kept looking round at Mary\xc3\xa1nka as he approached Vany\xc3\xbasha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere you see, the girl too is quite savage, just like a wild filly!\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Vany\xc3\xbasha, who though still busy with the luggage wagon had now\ncheered up a bit. \xe2\x80\x9c_La fame!_\xe2\x80\x9d he added in a loud triumphant voice and\nburst out laughing.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XI\n\n\nTowards evening the master of the house returned from his fishing, and\nhaving learnt that the cadet would pay for the lodging, pacified the\nold woman and satisfied Vany\xc3\xbasha\xe2\x80\x99s demands.\n\nEverything was arranged in the new quarters. Their hosts moved into the\nwinter hut and let their summer hut to the cadet for three rubles a\nmonth. Ol\xc3\xa9nin had something to eat and went to sleep. Towards evening\nhe woke up, washed and made himself tidy, dined, and having lit a\ncigarette sat down by the window that looked onto the street. It was\ncooler. The slanting shadow of the hut with its ornamental gables fell\nacross the dusty road and even bent upwards at the base of the wall of\nthe house opposite. The steep reed-thatched roof of that house shone in\nthe rays of the setting sun. The air grew fresher. Everything was\npeaceful in the village. The soldiers had settled down and become\nquiet. The herds had not yet been driven home and the people had not\nreturned from their work.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s lodging was situated almost at the end of the village. At rare\nintervals, from somewhere far beyond the T\xc3\xa9rek in those parts whence\nOl\xc3\xa9nin had just come (the Ch\xc3\xa9chen or the Kum\xc3\xbdtsk plain), came muffled\nsounds of firing. Ol\xc3\xa9nin was feeling very well contented after three\nmonths of bivouac life. His newly washed face was fresh and his\npowerful body clean (an unaccustomed sensation after the campaign) and\nin all his rested limbs he was conscious of a feeling of tranquillity\nand strength. His mind, too, felt fresh and clear. He thought of the\ncampaign and of past dangers. He remembered that he had faced them no\nworse than other men, and that he was accepted as a comrade among\nvaliant Caucasians. His Moscow recollections were left behind Heaven\nknows how far! The old life was wiped out and a quite new life had\nbegun in which there were as yet no mistakes. Here as a new man among\nnew men he could gain a new and good reputation. He was conscious of a\nyouthful and unreasoning joy of life. Looking now out of the window at\nthe boys spinning their tops in the shadow of the house, now round his\nneat new lodging, he thought how pleasantly he would settle down to\nthis new Cossack village life. Now and then he glanced at the mountains\nand the blue sky, and an appreciation of the solemn grandeur of nature\nmingled with his reminiscences and dreams. His new life had begun, not\nas he imagined it would when he left Moscow, but unexpectedly well.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe mountains, the mountains, the mountains!\xe2\x80\x9d they permeated all his\nthoughts and feelings.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s kissed his dog and licked the jug! ... Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka has kissed\nhis dog!\xe2\x80\x9d suddenly the little Cossacks who had been spinning their tops\nunder the window shouted, looking towards the side street. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s drunk\nhis bitch, and his dagger!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the boys, crowding together and\nstepping backwards.\n\nThese shouts were addressed to Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka, who with his gun on his\nshoulder and some pheasants hanging at his girdle was returning from\nhis shooting expedition.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have done wrong, lads, I have!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, vigorously swinging his\narms and looking up at the windows on both sides of the street. \xe2\x80\x9cI have\ndrunk the bitch; it was wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, evidently vexed but\npretending not to care.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin was surprised by the boys\xe2\x80\x99 behavior towards the old hunter, but\nwas still more struck by the expressive, intelligent face and the\npowerful build of the man whom they called Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere Daddy, here Cossack!\xe2\x80\x9d he called. \xe2\x80\x9cCome here!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old man looked into the window and stopped.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood evening, good man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, lifting his little cap off his\ncropped head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood evening, good man,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ol\xc3\xa9nin. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it the youngsters\nare shouting at you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDaddy Er\xc3\xb3shka came up to the window. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, they\xe2\x80\x99re teasing the old man.\nNo matter, I like it. Let them joke about their old daddy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\nwith those firm musical intonations with which old and venerable people\nspeak. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you an army commander?\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am a cadet. But where did you kill those pheasants?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\nOl\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dispatched these three hens in the forest,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the old man,\nturning his broad back towards the window to show the hen pheasants\nwhich were hanging with their heads tucked into his belt and staining\nhis coat with blood. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you seen any?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cTake a brace if\nyou like! Here you are,\xe2\x80\x9d and he handed two of the pheasants in at the\nwindow. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you a sportsman yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am. During the campaign I killed four myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour? What a lot!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man sarcastically. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd are you a\ndrinker? Do you drink _chikhir?_\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? I like a drink.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I see you are a trump! We shall be _kunaks_, you and I,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nDaddy Er\xc3\xb3shka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStep in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll have a drop of _chikhir_.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might as well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, \xe2\x80\x9cbut take the pheasants.\xe2\x80\x9d The old\nman\xe2\x80\x99s face showed that he liked the cadet. He had seen at once that he\ncould get free drinks from him, and that therefore it would be all\nright to give him a brace of pheasants.\n\nSoon Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka\xe2\x80\x99s figure appeared in the doorway of the hut, and it\nwas only then that Ol\xc3\xa9nin became fully conscious of the enormous size\nand sturdy build of this man, whose red-brown face with its perfectly\nwhite broad beard was all furrowed by deep lines produced by age and\ntoil. For an old man, the muscles of his legs, arms, and shoulders were\nquite exceptionally large and prominent. There were deep scars on his\nhead under the short-cropped hair. His thick sinewy neck was covered\nwith deep intersecting folds like a bull\xe2\x80\x99s. His horny hands were\nbruised and scratched. He stepped lightly and easily over the\nthreshold, unslung his gun and placed it in a corner, and casting a\nrapid glance round the room noted the value of the goods and chattels\ndeposited in the hut, and with out-turned toes stepped softly, in his\nsandals of raw hide, into the middle of the room. He brought with him a\npenetrating but not unpleasant smell of _chikhir_ wine, vodka,\ngunpowder, and congealed blood.\n\nDaddy Er\xc3\xb3shka bowed down before the icons, smoothed his beard, and\napproaching Ol\xc3\xa9nin held out his thick brown hand. \xe2\x80\x9c_Koshkildy_,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nhe; \xe2\x80\x9cThat is Tartar for \xe2\x80\x98Good-day\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Peace be unto you,\xe2\x80\x99 it means in\ntheir tongue.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Koshkildy_, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ol\xc3\xa9nin, shaking hands.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t, you won\xe2\x80\x99t know the right order! Fool!\xe2\x80\x9d said Daddy\nEr\xc3\xb3shka, shaking his head reproachfully. \xe2\x80\x9cIf anyone says \xe2\x80\x98_Koshkildy_\xe2\x80\x99\nto you, you must say \xe2\x80\x98_Allah rasi bo sun_,\xe2\x80\x99 that is, \xe2\x80\x98God save you.\xe2\x80\x99\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way, my dear fellow, and not \xe2\x80\x98_Koshkildy_.\xe2\x80\x99 But I\xe2\x80\x99ll teach\nyou all about it. We had a fellow here, Elias M\xc3\xb3sevich, one of your\nRussians, he and I were _kunaks_. He was a trump, a drunkard, a thief,\na sportsman\xe2\x80\x94and what a sportsman! I taught him everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what will you teach me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin, who was becoming more and\nmore interested in the old man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take you hunting and teach you to fish. I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you Ch\xc3\xa9chens\nand find a girl for you, if you like\xe2\x80\x94even that! That\xe2\x80\x99s the sort I am!\nI\xe2\x80\x99m a wag!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and the old man laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll sit down. I\xe2\x80\x99m tired.\n_Karga?_\xe2\x80\x9d he added inquiringly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what does \xe2\x80\x98_Karga_\xe2\x80\x99 mean?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that means \xe2\x80\x98All right\xe2\x80\x99 in Georgian. But I say it just so. It is a\nway I have, it\xe2\x80\x99s my favourite word. _Karga_, _Karga_. I say it just so;\nin fun I mean. Well, lad, won\xe2\x80\x99t you order the _chikhir?_ You\xe2\x80\x99ve got an\norderly, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey, Iv\xc3\xa1n!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cAll your soldiers are Iv\xc3\xa1ns. Is\nyours Iv\xc3\xa1n?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue enough, his name is Iv\xc3\xa1n\xe2\x80\x94Vany\xc3\xbasha. Here Vany\xc3\xbasha! Please get some\n_chikhir_ from our landlady and bring it here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIv\xc3\xa1n or Vany\xc3\xbasha, that\xe2\x80\x99s all one. Why are all your soldiers Iv\xc3\xa1ns?\nIv\xc3\xa1n, old fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, \xe2\x80\x9cyou tell them to give you some\nfrom the barrel they have begun. They have the best _chikhir_ in the\nvillage. But don\xe2\x80\x99t give more than thirty kopeks for the quart, mind,\nbecause that witch would be only too glad.... Our people are anathema\npeople; stupid people,\xe2\x80\x9d Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka continued in a confidential tone\nafter Vany\xc3\xbasha had gone out. \xe2\x80\x9cThey do not look upon you as on men, you\nare worse than a Tartar in their eyes. \xe2\x80\x98Worldly Russians\xe2\x80\x99 they say. But\nas for me, though you are a soldier you are still a man, and have a\nsoul in you. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that right? Elias M\xc3\xb3sevich was a soldier, yet what a\ntreasure of a man he was! Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that so, my dear fellow? That\xe2\x80\x99s why our\npeople don\xe2\x80\x99t like me; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t care! I\xe2\x80\x99m a merry fellow, and I like\neverybody. I\xe2\x80\x99m Er\xc3\xb3shka; yes, my dear fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the old Cossack patted the young man affectionately on the\nshoulder.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XII\n\n\nVany\xc3\xbasha, who meanwhile had finished his housekeeping arrangements and\nhad even been shaved by the company\xe2\x80\x99s barber and had pulled his\ntrousers out of his high boots as a sign that the company was stationed\nin comfortable quarters, was in excellent spirits. He looked\nattentively but not benevolently at Er\xc3\xb3shka, as at a wild beast he had\nnever seen before, shook his head at the floor which the old man had\ndirtied and, having taken two bottles from under a bench, went to the\nlandlady.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood evening, kind people,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, having made up his mind to be\nvery gentle. \xe2\x80\x9cMy master has sent me to get some _chikhir_. Will you\ndraw some for me, good folk?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old woman gave no answer. The girl, who was arranging the kerchief\non her head before a little Tartar mirror, looked round at Vany\xc3\xbasha in\nsilence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll pay money for it, honoured people,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vany\xc3\xbasha, jingling the\ncoppers in his pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cBe kind to us and we, too will be kind to you,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe added.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the old woman abruptly. \xe2\x80\x9cA quart.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, my own, draw some for them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Granny Ul\xc3\xadtka to her daughter.\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it from the cask that\xe2\x80\x99s begun, my precious.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe girl took the keys and a decanter and went out of the hut with\nVany\xc3\xbasha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, who is that young woman?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin, pointing to Mary\xc3\xa1nka,\nwho was passing the window. The old man winked and nudged the young man\nwith his elbow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d said he and reached out of the window. \xe2\x80\x9cKhm,\xe2\x80\x9d he coughed,\nand bellowed, \xe2\x80\x9cMary\xc3\xa1nka dear. Hallo, Mary\xc3\xa1nka, my girlie, won\xe2\x80\x99t you\nlove me, darling? I\xe2\x80\x99m a wag,\xe2\x80\x9d he added in a whisper to Ol\xc3\xa9nin. The\ngirl, not turning her head and swinging her arms regularly and\nvigorously, passed the window with the peculiarly smart and bold gait\nof a Cossack woman and only turned her dark shaded eyes slowly towards\nthe old man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove me and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be happy,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Er\xc3\xb3shka, winking, and he looked\nquestioningly at the cadet.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a fine fellow, I\xe2\x80\x99m a wag!\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a regular queen, that\ngirl. Eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is lovely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin. \xe2\x80\x9cCall her here!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cFor that one a match is being arranged\nwith Luk\xc3\xa1shka, Luke, a fine Cossack, a brave, who killed an _abrek_ the\nother day. I\xe2\x80\x99ll find you a better one. I\xe2\x80\x99ll find you one that will be\nall dressed up in silk and silver. Once I\xe2\x80\x99ve said it I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\nget you a regular beauty!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, an old man\xe2\x80\x94and say such things,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ol\xc3\xa9nin. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s a\nsin!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA sin? Where\xe2\x80\x99s the sin?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man emphatically. \xe2\x80\x9cA sin to look\nat a nice girl? A sin to have some fun with her? Or is it a sin to love\nher? Is that so in your parts? ... No, my dear fellow, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a sin,\nit\xe2\x80\x99s salvation! God made you and God made the girl too. He made it all;\nso it is no sin to look at a nice girl. That\xe2\x80\x99s what she was made for;\nto be loved and to give joy. That\xe2\x80\x99s how I judge it, my good fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHaving crossed the yard and entered a cool dark storeroom filled with\nbarrels, Mary\xc3\xa1nka went up to one of them and repeating the usual prayer\nplunged a dipper into it. Vany\xc3\xbasha standing in the doorway smiled as he\nlooked at her. He thought it very funny that she had only a smock on,\nclose-fitting behind and tucked up in front, and still funnier that she\nwore a necklace of silver coins. He thought this quite un-Russian and\nthat they would all laugh in the serfs\xe2\x80\x99 quarters at home if they saw a\ngirl like that. \xe2\x80\x9c_La fille comme c\xe2\x80\x99est tres bien_, for a change,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nthought. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell that to my master.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you standing in the light for, you devil!\xe2\x80\x9d the girl suddenly\nshouted. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you pass me the decanter!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHaving filled the decanter with cool red wine, Mary\xc3\xa1nka handed it to\nVany\xc3\xbasha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive the money to Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, pushing away the hand in which he\nheld the money.\n\nVany\xc3\xbasha laughed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you so cross, little dear?\xe2\x80\x9d he said good-naturedly,\nirresolutely shuffling with his feet while the girl was covering the\nbarrel.\n\nShe began to laugh.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you! Are you kind?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe, my master and I, are very kind,\xe2\x80\x9d Vany\xc3\xbasha answered decidedly. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\nare so kind that wherever we have stayed our hosts were always very\ngrateful. It\xe2\x80\x99s because he\xe2\x80\x99s generous.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe girl stood listening.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is your master married?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. The master is young and unmarried, because noble gentlemen can\nnever marry young,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vany\xc3\xbasha didactically.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA likely thing! See what a fed-up buffalo he is\xe2\x80\x94and too young to\nmarry! Is he the chief of you all?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy master is a cadet; that means he\xe2\x80\x99s not yet an officer, but he\xe2\x80\x99s\nmore important than a general\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s an important man! Because not only\nour colonel, but the Tsar himself, knows him,\xe2\x80\x9d proudly explained\nVany\xc3\xbasha. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are not like those other beggars in the line regiment,\nand our papa himself was a Senator. He had more than a thousand serfs,\nall his own, and they send us a thousand rubles at a time. That\xe2\x80\x99s why\neveryone likes us. Another may be a captain but have no money. What\xe2\x80\x99s\nthe use of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo away. I\xe2\x80\x99ll lock up,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl, interrupting him.\n\nVany\xc3\xbasha brought Ol\xc3\xa9nin the wine and announced that \xe2\x80\x9c_La fille c\xe2\x80\x99est\ntres joulie_,\xe2\x80\x9d and, laughing stupidly, at once went out.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XIII\n\n\nMeanwhile the tattoo had sounded in the village square. The people had\nreturned from their work. The herd lowed as in clouds of golden dust it\ncrowded at the village gate. The girls and the women hurried through\nthe streets and yards, turning in their cattle. The sun had quite\nhidden itself behind the distant snowy peaks. One pale bluish shadow\nspread over land and sky. Above the darkened gardens stars just\ndiscernible were kindling, and the sounds were gradually hushed in the\nvillage. The cattle having been attended to and left for the night, the\nwomen came out and gathered at the corners of the streets and, cracking\nsunflower seeds with their teeth, settled down on the earthen\nembankments of the houses. Later on Mary\xc3\xa1nka, having finished milking\nthe buffalo and the other two cows, also joined one of these groups.\n\nThe group consisted of several women and girls and one old Cossack man.\n\nThey were talking about the _abrek_ who had been killed.\n\nThe Cossack was narrating and the women questioning him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect he\xe2\x80\x99ll get a handsome reward,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the women.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course. It\xe2\x80\x99s said that they\xe2\x80\x99ll send him a cross.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cM\xc3\xb3sev did try to wrong him. Took the gun away from him, but the\nauthorities at Kizly\xc3\xa1r heard of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA mean creature that M\xc3\xb3sev is!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say Luk\xc3\xa1shka has come home,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked one of the girls.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe and Naz\xc3\xa1rka are merry-making at Y\xc3\xa1mka\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d (Y\xc3\xa1mka was an unmarried,\ndisreputable Cossack woman who kept an illicit pot-house.) \xe2\x80\x9cI heard say\nthey had drunk half a pailful.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat luck that Snatcher has,\xe2\x80\x9d somebody remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cA real snatcher. But\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no denying he\xe2\x80\x99s a fine lad, smart enough for anything, a\nright-minded lad! His father was just such another. Daddy Kiry\xc3\xa1k was:\nhe takes after his father. When he was killed the whole village howled.\nLook, there they are,\xe2\x80\x9d added the speaker, pointing to the Cossacks who\nwere coming down the street towards them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Ergush\xc3\xb3v has managed to come along with them too! The drunkard!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka, Naz\xc3\xa1rka, and Ergush\xc3\xb3v, having emptied half a pail of vodka,\nwere coming towards the girls. The faces of all three, but especially\nthat of the old Cossack, were redder than usual. Ergush\xc3\xb3v was reeling\nand kept laughing and nudging Naz\xc3\xa1rka in the ribs.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you not singing?\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted to the girls. \xe2\x80\x9cSing to our\nmerry-making, I tell you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey were welcomed with the words, \xe2\x80\x9cHad a good day? Had a good day?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy sing? It\xe2\x80\x99s not a holiday,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the women. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re tight,\nso you go and sing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nErgush\xc3\xb3v roared with laughter and nudged Naz\xc3\xa1rka. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better sing.\nAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ll begin too. I\xe2\x80\x99m clever, I tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you asleep, fair ones?\xe2\x80\x9d said Naz\xc3\xa1rka. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve come from the cordon\nto drink your health. We\xe2\x80\x99ve already drunk Luk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s health.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka, when he reached the group, slowly raised his cap and stopped\nin front of the girls. His broad cheekbones and neck were red. He stood\nand spoke softly and sedately, but in his tranquillity and sedateness\nthere was more of animation and strength than in all Naz\xc3\xa1rka\xe2\x80\x99s\nloquacity and bustle. He reminded one of a playful colt that with a\nsnort and a flourish of its tail suddenly stops short and stands as\nthough nailed to the ground with all four feet. Luk\xc3\xa1shka stood quietly\nin front of the girls, his eyes laughed, and he spoke but little as he\nglanced now at his drunken companions and now at the girls. When\nMary\xc3\xa1nka joined the group he raised his cap with a firm deliberate\nmovement, moved out of her way and then stepped in front of her with\none foot a little forward and with his thumbs in his belt, fingering\nhis dagger. Mary\xc3\xa1nka answered his greeting with a leisurely bow of her\nhead, settled down on the earth-bank, and took some seeds out of the\nbosom of her smock. Luk\xc3\xa1shka, keeping his eyes fixed on Mary\xc3\xa1nka,\nslowly cracked seeds and spat out the shells. All were quiet when\nMary\xc3\xa1nka joined the group.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you come for long?\xe2\x80\x9d asked a woman, breaking the silence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTill tomorrow morning,\xe2\x80\x9d quietly replied Luk\xc3\xa1shka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, God grant you get something good,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Cossack; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad\nof it, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve just been saying.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I say so too,\xe2\x80\x9d put in the tipsy Ergush\xc3\xb3v, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a lot of\nvisitors have come,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, pointing to a soldier who was passing\nby. \xe2\x80\x9cThe soldiers\xe2\x80\x99 vodka is good\xe2\x80\x94I like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve sent three of the devils to us,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the women.\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrandad went to the village Elders, but they say nothing can be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ha! Have you met with trouble?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ergush\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect they have smoked you out with their tobacco?\xe2\x80\x9d asked another\nwoman. \xe2\x80\x9cSmoke as much as you like in the yard, I say, but we won\xe2\x80\x99t\nallow it inside the hut. Not if the Elder himself comes, I won\xe2\x80\x99t allow\nit. Besides, they may rob you. He\xe2\x80\x99s not quartered any of them on\nhimself, no fear, that devil\xe2\x80\x99s son of an Elder.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t like it?\xe2\x80\x9d Ergush\xc3\xb3v began again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ve also heard say that the girls will have to make the soldiers\xe2\x80\x99\nbeds and offer them _chikhir_ and honey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Naz\xc3\xa1rka, putting one\nfoot forward and tilting his cap like Luk\xc3\xa1shka.\n\nErgush\xc3\xb3v burst into a roar of laughter, and seizing the girl nearest to\nhim, he embraced her. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you true.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, you black pitch!\xe2\x80\x9d squealed the girl, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell your old\nwoman.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell her,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted he. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s quite right what Naz\xc3\xa1rka says; a\ncircular has been sent round. He can read, you know. Quite true!\xe2\x80\x9d And\nhe began embracing the next girl.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you up to, you beast?\xe2\x80\x9d squealed the rosy, round-faced\n\xc3\x9astenka, laughing and lifting her arm to hit him.\n\nThe Cossack stepped aside and nearly fell.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, they say girls have no strength, and you nearly killed me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet away, you black pitch, what devil has brought you from the\ncordon?\xe2\x80\x9d said \xc3\x9astenka, and turning away from him she again burst out\nlaughing. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were asleep and missed the _abrek_, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you? Suppose\nhe had done for you it would have been all the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d have howled, I expect,\xe2\x80\x9d said Naz\xc3\xa1rka, laughing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowled! A likely thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust look, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care. She\xe2\x80\x99d howl, Naz\xc3\xa1rka, eh? Would she?\xe2\x80\x9d said\nErgush\xc3\xb3v.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka all this time had stood silently looking at Mary\xc3\xa1nka. His gaze\nevidently confused the girl.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mary\xc3\xa1nka! I hear they\xe2\x80\x99ve quartered one of the chiefs on you?\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid, drawing nearer.\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka, as was her wont, waited before she replied, and slowly\nraising her eyes looked at the Cossack. Luk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were laughing\nas if something special, apart from what was said, was taking place\nbetween himself and the girl.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right for them as they have two huts,\xe2\x80\x9d replied an old\nwoman on Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s behalf, \xe2\x80\x9cbut at F\xc3\xb3mushkin\xe2\x80\x99s now they also have one\nof the chiefs quartered on them and they say one whole corner is packed\nfull with his things, and the family have no room left. Was such a\nthing ever heard of as that they should turn a whole horde loose in the\nvillage?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what the plague are they going to do here?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard say they\xe2\x80\x99ll build a bridge across the T\xc3\xa9rek,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of\nthe girls.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ve been told that they will dig a pit to put the girls in\nbecause they don\xe2\x80\x99t love the lads,\xe2\x80\x9d said Naz\xc3\xa1rka, approaching \xc3\x9astenka;\nand he again made a whimsical gesture which set everybody laughing, and\nErgush\xc3\xb3v, passing by Mary\xc3\xa1nka, who was next in turn, began to embrace\nan old woman.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you hug Mary\xc3\xa1nka? You should do it to each in turn,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my old one is sweeter,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the Cossack, kissing the\nstruggling old woman.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll throttle me,\xe2\x80\x9d she screamed, laughing.\n\nThe tramp of regular footsteps at the other end of the street\ninterrupted their laughter. Three soldiers in their cloaks, with their\nmuskets on their shoulders, were marching in step to relieve guard by\nthe ammunition wagon.\n\nThe corporal, an old cavalry man, looked angrily at the Cossacks and\nled his men straight along the road where Luk\xc3\xa1shka and Naz\xc3\xa1rka were\nstanding, so that they should have to get out of the way. Naz\xc3\xa1rka\nmoved, but Luk\xc3\xa1shka only screwed up his eyes and turned his broad back\nwithout moving from his place.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople are standing here, so you go round,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, half turning\nhis head and tossing it contemptuously in the direction of the\nsoldiers.\n\nThe soldiers passed by in silence, keeping step regularly along the\ndusty road.\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka began laughing and all the other girls chimed in.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat swells!\xe2\x80\x9d said Naz\xc3\xa1rka, \xe2\x80\x9cJust like long-skirted choristers,\xe2\x80\x9d and\nhe walked a few steps down the road imitating the soldiers.\n\nAgain everyone broke into peals of laughter.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka came slowly up to Mary\xc3\xa1nka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where have you put up the chief?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka thought for a moment.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve let him have the new hut,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is he old or young,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Luk\xc3\xa1shka, sitting down beside her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked?\xe2\x80\x9d answered the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cI went to get him some\n_chikhir_ and saw him sitting at the window with Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka.\nRed-headed he seemed. They\xe2\x80\x99ve brought a whole cartload of things.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd she dropped her eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how glad I am that I got leave from the cordon!\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka,\nmoving closer to the girl and looking straight in her eyes all the\ntime.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have you come for long?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mary\xc3\xa1nka, smiling slightly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTill the morning. Give me some sunflower seeds,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, holding out\nhis hand.\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka now smiled outright and unfastened the neckband of her smock.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t take them all,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally I felt so dull all the time without you, I swear I did,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid in a calm, restrained whisper, helping himself to some seeds out\nof the bosom of the girl\xe2\x80\x99s smock, and stooping still closer over her he\ncontinued with laughing eyes to talk to her in low tones.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t come, I tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary\xc3\xa1nka suddenly said aloud, leaning away\nfrom him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo really ... what I wanted to say to you, ...\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Luk\xc3\xa1shka.\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the Heavens! Do come!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka shook her head, but did so with a smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNursey Mary\xc3\xa1nka! Hallo Nursey! Mammy is calling! Supper time!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted\nMary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s little brother, running towards the group.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m coming,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cGo, my dear, go alone\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll come in a\nminute.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka rose and raised his cap.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect I had better go home too, that will be best,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, trying\nto appear unconcerned but hardly able to repress a smile, and he\ndisappeared behind the corner of the house.\n\nMeanwhile night had entirely enveloped the village. Bright stars were\nscattered over the dark sky. The streets became dark and empty. Naz\xc3\xa1rka\nremained with the women on the earth-bank and their laughter was still\nheard, but Luk\xc3\xa1shka, having slowly moved away from the girls, crouched\ndown like a cat and then suddenly started running lightly, holding his\ndagger to steady it: not homeward, however, but towards the cornet\xe2\x80\x99s\nhouse. Having passed two streets he turned into a lane and lifting the\nskirt of his coat sat down on the ground in the shadow of a fence. \xe2\x80\x9cA\nregular cornet\xe2\x80\x99s daughter!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought about Mary\xc3\xa1nka. \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t even have\na lark\xe2\x80\x94the devil! But just wait a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe approaching footsteps of a woman attracted his attention. He began\nlistening, and laughed all by himself. Mary\xc3\xa1nka with bowed head,\nstriking the pales of the fences with a switch, was walking with rapid\nregular strides straight towards him. Luk\xc3\xa1shka rose. Mary\xc3\xa1nka started\nand stopped.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an accursed devil! You frightened me! So you have not gone home?\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe said, and laughed aloud.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka put one arm round her and with the other hand raised her face.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I wanted to tell you, by Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d his voice trembled and broke.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you talking of, at night time!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mary\xc3\xa1nka. \xe2\x80\x9cMother is\nwaiting for me, and you\xe2\x80\x99d better go to your sweetheart.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd freeing herself from his arms she ran away a few steps. When she\nhad reached the wattle fence of her home she stopped and turned to the\nCossack who was running beside her and still trying to persuade her to\nstay a while with him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what do you want to say, midnight-gadabout?\xe2\x80\x9d and she again began\nlaughing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t laugh at me, Mary\xc3\xa1nka! By the Heaven! Well, what if I have a\nsweetheart? May the devil take her! Only say the word and now I\xe2\x80\x99ll love\nyou\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything you wish. Here they are!\xe2\x80\x9d and he jingled the money\nin his pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cNow we can live splendidly. Others have pleasures, and\nI? I get no pleasure from you, Mary\xc3\xa1nka dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe girl did not answer. She stood before him breaking her switch into\nlittle bits with a rapid movement of her fingers.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka suddenly clenched his teeth and fists.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why keep waiting and waiting? Don\xe2\x80\x99t I love you, darling? You can\ndo what you like with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said he suddenly, frowning angrily and\nseizing both her hands.\n\nThe calm expression of Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s face and voice did not change.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t bluster, Luk\xc3\xa1shka, but listen to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, not pulling\naway her hands but holding the Cossack at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s true I am\na girl, but you listen to me! It does not depend on me, but if you love\nme I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you this. Let go my hands, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you without.\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll\nmarry you, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll never get any nonsense from me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary\xc3\xa1nka\nwithout turning her face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, you\xe2\x80\x99ll marry me? Marriage does not depend on us. Love me\nyourself, Mary\xc3\xa1nka dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, from sullen and furious\nbecoming again gentle, submissive, and tender, and smiling as he looked\nclosely into her eyes.\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka clung to him and kissed him firmly on the lips.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrother dear!\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, pressing him convulsively to her. Then,\nsuddenly tearing herself away, she ran into the gate of her house\nwithout looking round.\n\nIn spite of the Cossack\xe2\x80\x99s entreaties to wait another minute to hear\nwhat he had to say, Mary\xc3\xa1nka did not stop.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll be seen! I do believe that devil, our lodger,\nis walking about the yard.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCornet\xe2\x80\x99s daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Luk\xc3\xa1shka. \xe2\x80\x9cShe will marry me. Marriage is\nall very well, but you just love me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe found Naz\xc3\xa1rka at Y\xc3\xa1mka\xe2\x80\x99s house, and after having a spree with him\nwent to Dun\xc3\xa1yka\xe2\x80\x99s house, where, in spite of her not being faithful to\nhim, he spent the night.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XIV\n\n\nIt was quite true that Ol\xc3\xa9nin had been walking about the yard when\nMary\xc3\xa1nka entered the gate, and had heard her say, \xe2\x80\x9cThat devil, our\nlodger, is walking about.\xe2\x80\x9d He had spent that evening with Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka\nin the porch of his new lodging. He had had a table, a samovar, wine,\nand a candle brought out, and over a cup of tea and a cigar he listened\nto the tales the old man told seated on the threshold at his feet.\nThough the air was still, the candle dripped and flickered: now\nlighting up the post of the porch, now the table and crockery, now the\ncropped white head of the old man. Moths circled round the flame and,\nshedding the dust of their wings, fluttered on the table and in the\nglasses, flew into the candle flame, and disappeared in the black space\nbeyond. Ol\xc3\xa9nin and Er\xc3\xb3shka had emptied five bottles of _chikhir_.\nEr\xc3\xb3shka filled the glasses every time, offering one to Ol\xc3\xa9nin, drinking\nhis health, and talking untiringly. He told of Cossack life in the old\ndays: of his father, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Broad\xe2\x80\x9d, who alone had carried on his back a\nboar\xe2\x80\x99s carcass weighing three hundredweight, and drank two pails of\n_chikhir_ at one sitting. He told of his own days and his chum G\xc3\xadrchik,\nwith whom during the plague he used to smuggle felt cloaks across the\nT\xc3\xa9rek. He told how one morning he had killed two deer, and about his\n\xe2\x80\x9clittle soul\xe2\x80\x9d who used to run to him at the cordon at night. He told\nall this so eloquently and picturesquely that Ol\xc3\xa9nin did not notice how\ntime passed. \xe2\x80\x9cAh yes, my dear fellow, you did not know me in my golden\ndays; then I\xe2\x80\x99d have shown you things. Today it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Er\xc3\xb3shka licks the\njug\xe2\x80\x99, but then Er\xc3\xb3shka was famous in the whole regiment. Whose was the\nfinest horse? Who had a Gurda sword? To whom should one go to get a\ndrink? With whom go on the spree? Who should be sent to the mountains\nto kill Ahmet Khan? Why, always Er\xc3\xb3shka! Whom did the girls love?\nAlways Er\xc3\xb3shka had to answer for it. Because I was a real brave: a\ndrinker, a thief (I used to seize herds of horses in the mountains), a\nsinger; I was a master of every art! There are no Cossacks like that\nnowadays. It\xe2\x80\x99s disgusting to look at them. When they\xe2\x80\x99re that high\n(Er\xc3\xb3shka held his hand three feet from the ground) they put on idiotic\nboots and keep looking at them\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all the pleasure they know. Or\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ll drink themselves foolish, not like men but all wrong. And who\nwas I? I was Er\xc3\xb3shka, the thief; they knew me not only in this village\nbut up in the mountains. Tartar princes, my _kunaks_, used to come to\nsee me! I used to be everybody\xe2\x80\x99s _kunak_. If he was a Tartar\xe2\x80\x94with a\nTartar; an Armenian\xe2\x80\x94with an Armenian; a soldier\xe2\x80\x94with a soldier; an\nofficer\xe2\x80\x94with an officer! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t care as long as he was a drinker. He\nsays you should cleanse yourself from intercourse with the world, not\ndrink with soldiers, not eat with a Tartar.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho says all that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, our teacher! But listen to a Mullah or a Tartar Cadi. He says,\n\xe2\x80\x98You unbelieving Giaours, why do you eat pig?\xe2\x80\x99 That shows that everyone\nhas his own law. But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s all one. God has made everything for\nthe joy of man. There is no sin in any of it. Take example from an\nanimal. It lives in the Tartar\xe2\x80\x99s reeds or in ours. Wherever it happens\nto go, there is its home! Whatever God gives it, that it eats! But our\npeople say we have to lick red-hot plates in hell for that. And I think\nit\xe2\x80\x99s all a fraud,\xe2\x80\x9d he added after a pause.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is a fraud?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what the preachers say. We had an army captain in Chervl\xc3\xabna who\nwas my _kunak:_ a fine fellow just like me. He was killed in Ch\xc3\xa9chnya.\nWell, he used to say that the preachers invent all that out of their\nown heads. \xe2\x80\x98When you die the grass will grow on your grave and that\xe2\x80\x99s\nall!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d The old man laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was a desperate fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how old are you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord only knows! I must be about seventy. When a Tsaritsa reigned\nin Russia I was no longer very small. So you can reckon it out. I must\nbe seventy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes you must, but you are still a fine fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, thank Heaven I am healthy, quite healthy, except that a woman, a\nwitch, has harmed me....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, just harmed me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so when you die the grass will grow?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\nEr\xc3\xb3shka evidently did not wish to express his thought clearly. He was\nsilent for a while.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did you think? Drink!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted suddenly, smiling and\nhanding Ol\xc3\xa9nin some wine.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XV\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what was I saying?\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, trying to remember. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of man I am. I am a hunter. There is no hunter to equal\nme in the whole army. I will find and show you any animal and any bird,\nand what and where. I know it all! I have dogs, and two guns, and nets,\nand a screen and a hawk. I have everything, thank the Lord! If you are\nnot bragging but are a real sportsman, I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you everything. Do you\nknow what a man I am? When I have found a track\xe2\x80\x94I know the animal. I\nknow where he will lie down and where he\xe2\x80\x99ll drink or wallow. I make\nmyself a perch and sit there all night watching. What\xe2\x80\x99s the good of\nstaying at home? One only gets into mischief, gets drunk. And here\nwomen come and chatter, and boys shout at me\xe2\x80\x94enough to drive one mad\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a different matter when you go out at nightfall, choose yourself\na place, press down the reeds and sit there and stay waiting, like a\njolly fellow. One knows everything that goes on in the woods. One looks\nup at the sky: the stars move, you look at them and find out from them\nhow the time goes. One looks round\xe2\x80\x94the wood is rustling; one goes on\nwaiting, now there comes a crackling\xe2\x80\x94a boar comes to rub himself; one\nlistens to hear the young eaglets screech and then the cocks give voice\nin the village, or the geese. When you hear the geese you know it is\nnot yet midnight. And I know all about it! Or when a gun is fired\nsomewhere far away, thoughts come to me. One thinks, who is that\nfiring? Is it another Cossack like myself who has been watching for\nsome animal? And has he killed it? Or only wounded it so that now the\npoor thing goes through the reeds smearing them with its blood all for\nnothing? I don\xe2\x80\x99t like that! Oh, how I dislike it! Why injure a beast?\nYou fool, you fool! Or one thinks, \xe2\x80\x98Maybe an _abrek_ has killed some\nsilly little Cossack.\xe2\x80\x99 All this passes through one\xe2\x80\x99s mind. And once as\nI sat watching by the river I saw a cradle floating down. It was sound\nexcept for one corner which was broken off. Thoughts did come that\ntime! I thought some of your soldiers, the devils, must have got into a\nTartar village and seized the Ch\xc3\xa9chen women, and one of the devils has\nkilled the little one: taken it by its legs, and hit its head against a\nwall. Don\xe2\x80\x99t they do such things? Sh! Men have no souls! And thoughts\ncame to me that filled me with pity. I thought: they\xe2\x80\x99ve thrown away the\ncradle and driven the wife out, and her brave has taken his gun and\ncome across to our side to rob us. One watches and thinks. And when one\nhears a litter breaking through the thicket, something begins to knock\ninside one. Dear one, come this way! \xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99ll scent me,\xe2\x80\x99 one thinks;\nand one sits and does not stir while one\xe2\x80\x99s heart goes dun! dun! dun!\nand simply lifts you. Once this spring a fine litter came near me, I\nsaw something black. \xe2\x80\x98In the name of the Father and of the Son,\xe2\x80\x99 and I\nwas just about to fire when she grunts to her pigs: \xe2\x80\x98Danger, children,\xe2\x80\x99\nshe says, \xe2\x80\x98there\xe2\x80\x99s a man here,\xe2\x80\x99 and off they all ran, breaking through\nthe bushes. And she had been so close I could almost have bitten her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could a sow tell her brood that a man was there?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think? You think the beast\xe2\x80\x99s a fool? No, he is wiser than\na man though you do call him a pig! He knows everything. Take this for\ninstance. A man will pass along your track and not notice it; but a pig\nas soon as it gets onto your track turns and runs at once: that shows\nthere is wisdom in him, since he scents your smell and you don\xe2\x80\x99t. And\nthere is this to be said too: you wish to kill it and it wishes to go\nabout the woods alive. You have one law and it has another. It is a\npig, but it is no worse than you\xe2\x80\x94it too is God\xe2\x80\x99s creature. Ah, dear!\nMan is foolish, foolish, foolish!\xe2\x80\x9d The old man repeated this several\ntimes and then, letting his head drop, he sat thinking.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin also became thoughtful, and descending from the porch with his\nhands behind his back began pacing up and down the yard.\n\nEr\xc3\xb3shka, rousing himself, raised his head and began gazing intently at\nthe moths circling round the flickering flame of the candle and burning\nthemselves in it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFool, fool!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you flying to? Fool, fool!\xe2\x80\x9d He rose\nand with his thick fingers began to drive away the moths.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll burn, little fool! Fly this way, there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of room.\xe2\x80\x9d He\nspoke tenderly, trying to catch them delicately by their wings with his\nthick fingers and then letting them fly again. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are killing\nyourself and I am sorry for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe sat a long time chattering and sipping out of the bottle. Ol\xc3\xa9nin\npaced up and down the yard. Suddenly he was struck by the sound of\nwhispering outside the gate. Involuntarily holding his breath, he heard\na woman\xe2\x80\x99s laughter, a man\xe2\x80\x99s voice, and the sound of a kiss.\nIntentionally rustling the grass under his feet he crossed to the\nopposite side of the yard, but after a while the wattle fence creaked.\nA Cossack in a dark Circassian coat and a white sheepskin cap passed\nalong the other side of the fence (it was Luke), and a tall woman with\na white kerchief on her head went past Ol\xc3\xa9nin. \xe2\x80\x9cYou and I have nothing\nto do with one another\xe2\x80\x9d was what Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s firm step gave him to\nunderstand. He followed her with his eyes to the porch of the hut, and\nhe even saw her through the window take off her kerchief and sit down.\nAnd suddenly a feeling of lonely depression and some vague longings and\nhopes, and envy of someone or other, overcame the young man\xe2\x80\x99s soul.\n\nThe last lights had been put out in the huts. The last sounds had died\naway in the village. The wattle fences and the cattle gleaming white in\nthe yards, the roofs of the houses and the stately poplars, all seemed\nto be sleeping the labourers\xe2\x80\x99 healthy peaceful sleep. Only the\nincessant ringing voices of frogs from the damp distance reached the\nyoung man. In the east the stars were growing fewer and fewer and\nseemed to be melting in the increasing light, but overhead they were\ndenser and deeper than before. The old man was dozing with his head on\nhis hand. A cock crowed in the yard opposite, but Ol\xc3\xa9nin still paced up\nand down thinking of something. The sound of a song sung by several\nvoices reached him and he stepped up to the fence and listened. The\nvoices of several young Cossacks carolled a merry song, and one voice\nwas distinguishable among them all by its firm strength.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know who is singing there?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, rousing himself.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the Brave, Luk\xc3\xa1shka. He has killed a Ch\xc3\xa9chen and now he\nrejoices. And what is there to rejoice at? ... The fool, the fool!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have you ever killed people?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou devil!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you asking? One must not\ntalk so. It is a serious thing to destroy a human being ... Ah, a very\nserious thing! Good-bye, my dear fellow. I\xe2\x80\x99ve eaten my fill and am\ndrunk,\xe2\x80\x9d he said rising. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I come tomorrow to go shooting?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, come!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind, get up early; if you oversleep you will be fined!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever fear, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be up before you,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\nThe old man left. The song ceased, but one could hear footsteps and\nmerry talk. A little later the singing broke out again but farther\naway, and Er\xc3\xb3shka\xe2\x80\x99s loud voice chimed in with the other. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat people,\nwhat a life!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Ol\xc3\xa9nin with a sigh as he returned alone to his\nhut.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XVI\n\n\nDaddy Er\xc3\xb3shka was a superannuated and solitary Cossack: twenty years\nago his wife had gone over to the Orthodox Church and run away from him\nand married a Russian sergeant-major, and he had no children. He was\nnot bragging when he spoke of himself as having been the boldest\ndare-devil in the village when he was young. Everybody in the regiment\nknew of his old-time prowess. The death of more than one Russian, as\nwell as Ch\xc3\xa9chen, lay on his conscience. He used to go plundering in the\nmountains, and robbed the Russians too; and he had twice been in\nprison. The greater part of his life was spent in the forests, hunting.\nThere he lived for days on a crust of bread and drank nothing but\nwater. But on the other hand, when he was in the village he made merry\nfrom morning to night. After leaving Ol\xc3\xa9nin he slept for a couple of\nhours and awoke before it was light. He lay on his bed thinking of the\nman he had become acquainted with the evening before. Ol\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s\n\xe2\x80\x9csimplicity\xe2\x80\x9d (simplicity in the sense of not grudging him a drink)\npleased him very much, and so did Ol\xc3\xa9nin himself. He wondered why the\nRussians were all \xe2\x80\x9csimple\xe2\x80\x9d and so rich, and why they were educated, and\nyet knew nothing. He pondered on these questions and also considered\nwhat he might get out of Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\nDaddy Er\xc3\xb3shka\xe2\x80\x99s hut was of a good size and not old, but the absence of\na woman was very noticeable in it. Contrary to the usual cleanliness of\nthe Cossacks, the whole of this hut was filthy and exceedingly untidy.\nA blood-stained coat had been thrown on the table, half a dough-cake\nlay beside a plucked and mangled crow with which to feed the hawk.\nSandals of raw hide, a gun, a dagger, a little bag, wet clothes, and\nsundry rags lay scattered on the benches. In a corner stood a tub with\nstinking water, in which another pair of sandals were being steeped,\nand near by was a gun and a hunting-screen. On the floor a net had been\nthrown down and several dead pheasants lay there, while a hen tied by\nits leg was walking about near the table pecking among the dirt. In the\nunheated oven stood a broken pot with some kind of milky liquid. On the\ntop of the oven a falcon was screeching and trying to break the cord by\nwhich it was tied, and a moulting hawk sat quietly on the edge of the\noven, looking askance at the hen and occasionally bowing its head to\nright and left. Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka himself, in his shirt, lay on his back on\na short bed rigged up between the wall and the oven, with his strong\nlegs raised and his feet on the oven. He was picking with his thick\nfingers at the scratches left on his hands by the hawk, which he was\naccustomed to carry without wearing gloves. The whole room, especially\nnear the old man, was filled with that strong but not unpleasant\nmixture of smells that he always carried about with him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Uyde-ma_, Daddy?\xe2\x80\x9d (Is Daddy in?) came through the window in a sharp\nvoice, which he at once recognized as Luk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Uyde, Uyde, Uyde_. I am in!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cCome in, neighbour\nMark, Luke Mark. Come to see Daddy? On your way to the cordon?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt the sound of his master\xe2\x80\x99s shout the hawk flapped his wings and\npulled at his cord.\n\nThe old man was fond of Luk\xc3\xa1shka, who was the only man he excepted from\nhis general contempt for the younger generation of Cossacks. Besides\nthat, Luk\xc3\xa1shka and his mother, as near neighbours, often gave the old\nman wine, clotted cream, and other home produce which Er\xc3\xb3shka did not\npossess. Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka, who all his life had allowed himself to get\ncarried away, always explained his infatuations from a practical point\nof view. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, why not?\xe2\x80\x9d he used to say to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll give them\nsome fresh meat, or a bird, and they won\xe2\x80\x99t forget Daddy: they\xe2\x80\x99ll\nsometimes bring a cake or a piece of pie.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, Mark! I am glad to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the old man\ncheerfully, and quickly putting down his bare feet he jumped off his\nbed and walked a step or two along the creaking floor, looked down at\nhis out-turned toes, and suddenly, amused by the appearance of his\nfeet, smiled, stamped with his bare heel on the ground, stamped again,\nand then performed a funny dance-step. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s clever, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked,\nhis small eyes glistening. Luk\xc3\xa1shka smiled faintly. \xe2\x80\x9cGoing back to the\ncordon?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the old man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have brought the _chikhir_ I promised you when we were at the\ncordon.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay Christ save you!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, and he took up the extremely\nwide trousers that were lying on the floor, and his _beshmet_, put them\non, fastened a strap round his waist, poured some water from an\nearthenware pot over his hands, wiped them on the old trousers,\nsmoothed his beard with a bit of comb, and stopped in front of\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka. \xe2\x80\x9cReady,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka fetched a cup, wiped it and filled it with wine, and then\nhanded it to the old man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour health! To the Father and the Son!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, accepting\nthe wine with solemnity. \xe2\x80\x9cMay you have what you desire, may you always\nbe a hero, and obtain a cross.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka also drank a little after repeating a prayer, and then put the\nwine on the table. The old man rose and brought out some dried fish\nwhich he laid on the threshold, where he beat it with a stick to make\nit tender; then, having put it with his horny hands on a blue plate\n(his only one), he placed it on the table.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have all I want. I have victuals, thank God!\xe2\x80\x9d he said proudly.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and what of M\xc3\xb3sev?\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka, evidently wishing to know the old man\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, told him how\nthe officer had taken the gun from him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind the gun,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t give the gun you\nwill get no reward.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they say, Daddy, it\xe2\x80\x99s little reward a fellow gets when he is not\nyet a mounted Cossack; and the gun is a fine one, a Crimean, worth\neighty rubles.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, let it go! I had a dispute like that with an officer, he wanted my\nhorse. \xe2\x80\x98Give it me and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be made a cornet,\xe2\x80\x99 says he. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\nand I got nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Daddy, but you see I have to buy a horse; and they say you can\xe2\x80\x99t\nget one the other side of the river under fifty rubles, and mother has\nnot yet sold our wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t bother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man; \xe2\x80\x9cwhen Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka was your\nage he already stole herds of horses from the Nog\xc3\xa1y folk and drove them\nacross the T\xc3\xa9rek. Sometimes we\xe2\x80\x99d give a fine horse for a quart of vodka\nor a cloak.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so cheap?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Luk\xc3\xa1shka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a fool, a fool, Mark,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man contemptuously. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s what one steals for, so as not to be stingy! As for you, I\nsuppose you haven\xe2\x80\x99t so much as seen how one drives off a herd of\nhorses? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you speak?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s one to say, Daddy?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Luk\xc3\xa1shka. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems we are not the\nsame sort of men as you were.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a fool, Mark, a fool! \xe2\x80\x98Not the same sort of men!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the\nold man, mimicking the Cossack lad. \xe2\x80\x9cI was not that sort of Cossack at\nyour age.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Luk\xc3\xa1shka.\n\nThe old man shook his head contemptuously.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDaddy Er\xc3\xb3shka was _simple;_ he did not grudge anything! That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\nwas _kunak_ with all Ch\xc3\xa9chnya. A _kunak_ would come to visit me and I\xe2\x80\x99d\nmake him drunk with vodka and make him happy and put him to sleep with\nme, and when I went to see him I\xe2\x80\x99d take him a present\xe2\x80\x94a dagger! That\xe2\x80\x99s\nthe way it is done, and not as you do nowadays: the only amusement lads\nhave now is to crack seeds and spit out the shells!\xe2\x80\x9d the old man\nfinished contemptuously, imitating the present-day Cossacks cracking\nseeds and spitting out the shells.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s so!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you wish to be a fellow of the right sort, be a brave and not a\npeasant! Because even a peasant can buy a horse\xe2\x80\x94pay the money and take\nthe horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey were silent for a while.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, of course it\xe2\x80\x99s dull both in the village and the cordon, Daddy:\nbut there\xe2\x80\x99s nowhere one can go for a bit of sport. All our fellows are\nso timid. Take Naz\xc3\xa1rka. The other day when we went to the Tartar\nvillage, Gir\xc3\xa9y Khan asked us to come to Nog\xc3\xa1y to take some horses, but\nno one went, and how was I to go alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what of Daddy? Do you think I am quite dried up? ... No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not\ndried up. Let me have a horse and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be off to Nog\xc3\xa1y at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good of talking nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d said Luke. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better tell me\nwhat to do about Gir\xc3\xa9y Khan. He says, \xe2\x80\x98Only bring horses to the T\xc3\xa9rek,\nand then even if you bring a whole stud I\xe2\x80\x99ll find a place for them.\xe2\x80\x99\nYou see he\xe2\x80\x99s also a shaven-headed Tartar\xe2\x80\x94how\xe2\x80\x99s one to believe him?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may trust Gir\xc3\xa9y Khan, all his kin were good people. His father too\nwas a faithful _kunak_. But listen to Daddy and I won\xe2\x80\x99t teach you\nwrong: make him take an oath, then it will be all right. And if you go\nwith him, have your pistol ready all the same, especially when it comes\nto dividing up the horses. I was nearly killed that way once by a\nCh\xc3\xa9chen. I wanted ten rubles from him for a horse. Trusting is all\nright, but don\xe2\x80\x99t go to sleep without a gun.\xe2\x80\x9d Luk\xc3\xa1shka listened\nattentively to the old man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Daddy, have you any stone-break grass?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked after a pause.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t any, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll teach you how to get it. You\xe2\x80\x99re a good lad\nand won\xe2\x80\x99t forget the old man.... Shall I tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, Daddy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know a tortoise? She\xe2\x80\x99s a devil, the tortoise is!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I know!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFind her nest and fence it round so that she can\xe2\x80\x99t get in. Well,\nshe\xe2\x80\x99ll come, go round it, and then will go off to find the stone-break\ngrass and will bring some along and destroy the fence. Anyhow next\nmorning come in good time, and where the fence is broken there you\xe2\x80\x99ll\nfind the stone-break grass lying. Take it wherever you like. No lock\nand no bar will be able to stop you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you tried it yourself, Daddy?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for trying, I have not tried it, but I was told of it by good\npeople. I used only one charm: that was to repeat the Pilgrim rhyme\nwhen mounting my horse; and no one ever killed me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the Pilgrim rhyme, Daddy?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know it? Oh, what people! You\xe2\x80\x99re right to ask Daddy.\nWell, listen, and repeat after me:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHail! Ye, living in Sion,\nThis is your King,\nOur steeds we shall sit on,\nSophonius is weeping.\nZacharias is speaking,\nFather Pilgrim,\nMankind ever loving.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKind ever loving,\xe2\x80\x9d the old man repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know it now? Try it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka laughed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Daddy, was it that that hindered their killing you? Maybe it\njust happened so!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve grown too clever! You learn it all, and say it. It will do you\nno harm. Well, suppose you have sung \xe2\x80\x98Pilgrim\xe2\x80\x99, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d and\nthe old man himself began laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cBut just one thing, Luke, don\xe2\x80\x99t\nyou go to Nog\xc3\xa1y!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTimes have changed. You are not the same men. You\xe2\x80\x99ve become rubbishy\nCossacks! And see how many Russians have come down on us! You\xe2\x80\x99d get to\nprison. Really, give it up! Just as if you could! Now G\xc3\xadrchik and I, we\nused...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the old man was about to begin one of his endless tales, but\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka glanced at the window and interrupted him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is quite light. Daddy. It\xe2\x80\x99s time to be off. Look us up some day.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay Christ save you! I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the officer; I promised to take him\nout shooting. He seems a good fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XVII\n\n\nFrom Er\xc3\xb3shka\xe2\x80\x99s hut Luk\xc3\xa1shka went home. As he returned, the dewy mists\nwere rising from the ground and enveloped the village. In various\nplaces the cattle, though out of sight, could be heard beginning to\nstir. The cocks called to one another with increasing frequency and\ninsistence. The air was becoming more transparent, and the villagers\nwere getting up. Not till he was close to it could Luk\xc3\xa1shka discern the\nfence of his yard, all wet with dew, the porch of the hut, and the open\nshed. From the misty yard he heard the sound of an axe chopping wood.\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka entered the hut. His mother was up, and stood at the oven\nthrowing wood into it. His little sister was still lying in bed asleep.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Luk\xc3\xa1shka, had enough holiday-making?\xe2\x80\x9d asked his mother softly.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you spend the night?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was in the village,\xe2\x80\x9d replied her son reluctantly, reaching for his\nmusket, which he drew from its cover and examined carefully.\n\nHis mother swayed her head.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka poured a little gunpowder onto the pan, took out a little bag\nfrom which he drew some empty cartridge cases which he began filling,\ncarefully plugging each one with a ball wrapped in a rag. Then, having\ntested the loaded cartridges with his teeth and examined them, he put\ndown the bag.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Mother, I told you the bags wanted mending; have they been\ndone?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, our dumb girl was mending something last night. Why, is it\ntime for you to be going back to the cordon? I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen anything of\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, as soon as I have got ready I shall have to go,\xe2\x80\x9d answered\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka, tying up the gunpowder. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd where is our dumb one? Outside?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cChopping wood, I expect. She kept fretting for you. \xe2\x80\x98I shall not see\nhim at all!\xe2\x80\x99 she said. She puts her hand to her face like this, and\nclicks her tongue and presses her hands to her heart as much as to\nsay\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98sorry.\xe2\x80\x99 Shall I call her in? She understood all about the\n_abrek_.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I had some tallow there; bring it: I\nmust grease my sword.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old woman went out, and a few minutes later Luk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s dumb sister\ncame up the creaking steps and entered the hut. She was six years older\nthan her brother and would have been extremely like him had it not been\nfor the dull and coarsely changeable expression (common to all deaf and\ndumb people) of her face. She wore a coarse smock all patched; her feet\nwere bare and muddy, and on her head she had an old blue kerchief. Her\nneck, arms, and face were sinewy like a peasant\xe2\x80\x99s. Her clothing and her\nwhole appearance indicated that she always did the hard work of a man.\nShe brought in a heap of logs which she threw down by the oven. Then\nshe went up to her brother, and with a joyful smile which made her\nwhole face pucker up, touched him on the shoulder and began making\nrapid signs to him with her hands, her face, and whole body.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right, that\xe2\x80\x99s right, St\xc3\xabpka is a trump!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the brother,\nnodding. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s fetched everything and mended everything, she\xe2\x80\x99s a\ntrump! Here, take this for it!\xe2\x80\x9d He brought out two pieces of\ngingerbread from his pocket and gave them to her.\n\nThe dumb woman\xe2\x80\x99s face flushed with pleasure, and she began making a\nweird noise for joy. Having seized the gingerbread she began to\ngesticulate still more rapidly, frequently pointing in one direction\nand passing her thick finger over her eyebrows and her face. Luk\xc3\xa1shka\nunderstood her and kept nodding, while he smiled slightly. She was\ntelling him to give the girls dainties, and that the girls liked him,\nand that one girl, Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x94the best of them all\xe2\x80\x94loved him. She\nindicated Mary\xc3\xa1nka by rapidly pointing in the direction of Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s\nhome and to her own eyebrows and face, and by smacking her lips and\nswaying her head. \xe2\x80\x9cLoves\xe2\x80\x9d she expressed by pressing her hands to her\nbreast, kissing her hand, and pretending to embrace someone. Their\nmother returned to the hut, and seeing what her dumb daughter was\nsaying, smiled and shook her head. Her daughter showed her the\ngingerbread and again made the noise which expressed joy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told Ul\xc3\xadtka the other day that I\xe2\x80\x99d send a matchmaker to them,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nthe mother. \xe2\x80\x9cShe took my words well.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka looked silently at his mother.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how about selling the wine, mother? I need a horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll cart it when I have time. I must get the barrels ready,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\nmother, evidently not wishing her son to meddle in domestic matters.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you go out you\xe2\x80\x99ll find a bag in the passage. I borrowed from the\nneighbours and got something for you to take back to the cordon; or\nshall I put it in your saddle-bag?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Luk\xc3\xa1shka. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if Gir\xc3\xa9y Khan should come across\nthe river send him to me at the cordon, for I shan\xe2\x80\x99t get leave again\nfor a long time now; I have some business with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe began to get ready to start.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will send him on,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems you have been\nspreeing at Y\xc3\xa1mka\xe2\x80\x99s all the time. I went out in the night to see the\ncattle, and I think it was your voice I heard singing songs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka did not reply, but went out into the passage, threw the bags\nover his shoulder, tucked up the skirts of his coat, took his musket,\nand then stopped for a moment on the threshold.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, mother!\xe2\x80\x9d he said as he closed the gate behind him. \xe2\x80\x9cSend me\na small barrel with Naz\xc3\xa1rka. I promised it to the lads, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll call\nfor it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay Christ keep you, Luk\xc3\xa1shka. God be with you! I\xe2\x80\x99ll send you some,\nsome from the new barrel,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, going to the fence: \xe2\x80\x9cBut\nlisten,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, leaning over the fence.\n\nThe Cossack stopped.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been making merry here; well, that\xe2\x80\x99s all right. Why should not\na young man amuse himself? God has sent you luck and that\xe2\x80\x99s good. But\nnow look out and mind, my son. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you go and get into mischief.\nAbove all, satisfy your superiors: one has to! And I will sell the wine\nand find money for a horse and will arrange a match with the girl for\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, all right!\xe2\x80\x9d answered her son, frowning.\n\nHis deaf sister shouted to attract his attention. She pointed to her\nhead and the palm of her hand, to indicate the shaved head of a\nCh\xc3\xa9chen. Then she frowned, and pretending to aim with a gun, she\nshrieked and began rapidly humming and shaking her head. This meant\nthat Luk\xc3\xa1shka should kill another Ch\xc3\xa9chen.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka understood. He smiled, and shifting the gun at his back under\nhis cloak stepped lightly and rapidly, and soon disappeared in the\nthick mist.\n\nThe old woman, having stood a little while at the gate, returned\nsilently to the hut and immediately began working.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XVIII\n\n\nLukasha returned to the cordon and at the same time Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka\nwhistled to his dogs and, climbing over his wattle fence, went to\nOl\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s lodging, passing by the back of the houses (he disliked\nmeeting women before going out hunting or shooting). He found Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nstill asleep, and even Vany\xc3\xbasha, though awake, was still in bed and\nlooking round the room considering whether it was not time to get up,\nwhen Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka, gun on shoulder and in full hunter\xe2\x80\x99s trappings,\nopened the door.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA cudgel!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted in his deep voice. \xe2\x80\x9cAn alarm! The Ch\xc3\xa9chens are\nupon us! Iv\xc3\xa1n! Get the samovar ready for your master, and get up\nyourself\xe2\x80\x94quick,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s our way, my good man! Why\neven the girls are already up! Look out of the window. See, she\xe2\x80\x99s going\nfor water and you\xe2\x80\x99re still sleeping!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin awoke and jumped up, feeling fresh and lighthearted at the sight\nof the old man and at the sound of his voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuick, Vany\xc3\xbasha, quick!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that the way you go hunting?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cOthers are having\ntheir breakfast and you are asleep! Lyam! Here!\xe2\x80\x9d he called to his dog.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs your gun ready?\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, as loud as if a whole crowd were in\nthe hut.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s true I\xe2\x80\x99m guilty, but it can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped! The powder,\nVany\xc3\xbasha, and the wads!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fine!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the old man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Du tay voulay vou?_\xe2\x80\x9d asked Vany\xc3\xbasha, grinning.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not one of us\xe2\x80\x94your gabble is not like our speech, you devil!\xe2\x80\x9d\nthe old man shouted at Vany\xc3\xbasha, showing the stumps of his teeth.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA first offence must be forgiven,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin playfully, drawing on\nhis high boots.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first offence shall be forgiven,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Er\xc3\xb3shka, \xe2\x80\x9cbut if you\noversleep another time you\xe2\x80\x99ll be fined a pail of _chikhir_. When it\ngets warmer you won\xe2\x80\x99t find the deer.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd even if we do find him he is wiser than we are,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin,\nrepeating the words spoken by the old man the evening before, \xe2\x80\x9cand you\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t deceive him!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, laugh away! You kill one first, and then you may talk. Now then,\nhurry up! Look, there\xe2\x80\x99s the master himself coming to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d added\nEr\xc3\xb3shka, looking out of the window. \xe2\x80\x9cJust see how he\xe2\x80\x99s got himself up.\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s put on a new coat so that you should see that he\xe2\x80\x99s an officer. Ah,\nthese people, these people!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSure enough Vany\xc3\xbasha came in and announced that the master of the house\nwished to see Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_L\xe2\x80\x99arjan!_\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked profoundly, to forewarn his master of the\nmeaning of this visitation. Following him, the master of the house in a\nnew Circassian coat with an officer\xe2\x80\x99s stripes on the shoulders and with\npolished boots (quite exceptional among Cossacks) entered the room,\nswaying from side to side, and congratulated his lodger on his safe\narrival.\n\nThe cornet, Elias Vas\xc3\xadlich, was an _educated_ Cossack. He had been to\nRussia proper, was a regimental schoolteacher, and above all he was\nnoble. He wished to appear noble, but one could not help feeling\nbeneath his grotesque pretence of polish, his affectation, his\nself-confidence, and his absurd way of speaking, he was just the same\nas Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka. This could also be clearly seen by his sunburnt face\nand his hands and his red nose. Ol\xc3\xa9nin asked him to sit down.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, Father Elias Vas\xc3\xadlich,\xe2\x80\x9d said Er\xc3\xb3shka, rising with (or so\nit seemed to Ol\xc3\xa9nin) an ironically low bow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning. Daddy. So you\xe2\x80\x99re here already,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cornet, with a\ncareless nod.\n\nThe cornet was a man of about forty, with a grey pointed beard, skinny\nand lean, but handsome and very fresh-looking for his age. Having come\nto see Ol\xc3\xa9nin he was evidently afraid of being taken for an ordinary\nCossack, and wanted to let Ol\xc3\xa9nin feel his importance from the first.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s our Egyptian Nimrod,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, addressing Ol\xc3\xa9nin and\npointing to the old man with a self-satisfied smile. \xe2\x80\x9cA mighty hunter\nbefore the Lord! He\xe2\x80\x99s our foremost man on every hand. You\xe2\x80\x99ve already\nbeen pleased to get acquainted with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDaddy Er\xc3\xb3shka gazed at his feet in their shoes of wet raw hide and\nshook his head thoughtfully at the cornet\xe2\x80\x99s ability and learning, and\nmuttered to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cGyptian Nimvrod! What things he invents!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you see we mean to go hunting,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, exactly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cornet, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have a small business with\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeeing that you are a gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d began the cornet, \xe2\x80\x9cand as I may\nunderstand myself to be in the rank of an officer too, and therefore we\nmay always progressively negotiate, as gentlemen do.\xe2\x80\x9d (He stopped and\nlooked with a smile at Ol\xc3\xa9nin and at the old man.) \xe2\x80\x9cBut if you have the\ndesire with my consent, then, as my wife is a foolish woman of our\nclass, she could not quite comprehend your words of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s date.\nTherefore my quarters might be let for six rubles to the Regimental\nAdjutant, without the stables; but I can always avert that from myself\nfree of charge. But, as you desire, therefore I, being myself of an\nofficer\xe2\x80\x99s rank, can come to an agreement with you in everything\npersonally, as an inhabitant of this district, not according to our\ncustoms, but can maintain the conditions in every way....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeaks clearly!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the old man.\n\nThe cornet continued in the same strain for a long time. At last, not\nwithout difficulty, Ol\xc3\xa9nin gathered that the cornet wished to let his\nrooms to him, Ol\xc3\xa9nin, for six rubles a month. The latter gladly agreed\nto this, and offered his visitor a glass of tea. The cornet declined\nit.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAccording to our silly custom we consider it a sort of sin to drink\nout of a \xe2\x80\x98worldly\xe2\x80\x99 tumbler,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThough, of course, with my\neducation I may understand, but my wife from her human weakness...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, will you have some tea?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you will permit me, I will bring my own particular glass,\xe2\x80\x9d answered\nthe cornet, and stepped out into the porch.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring me my glass!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\n\nIn a few minutes the door opened and a young sunburnt arm in a print\nsleeve thrust itself in, holding a tumbler in the hand. The cornet went\nup, took it, and whispered something to his daughter. Ol\xc3\xa9nin poured tea\nfor the cornet into the latter\xe2\x80\x99s own \xe2\x80\x9cparticular\xe2\x80\x9d glass, and for\nEr\xc3\xb3shka into a \xe2\x80\x9cworldly\xe2\x80\x9d glass.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, I do not desire to detain you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cornet, scalding his\nlips and emptying his tumbler. \xe2\x80\x9cI too have a great liking for fishing,\nand I am here, so to say, only on leave of absence for recreation from\nmy duties. I too have the desire to tempt fortune and see whether some\n_Gifts of the T\xc3\xa9rek_ may not fall to my share. I hope you too will come\nand see us and have a drink of our wine, according to the custom of our\nvillage,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\nThe cornet bowed, shook hands with Ol\xc3\xa9nin, and went out. While Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nwas getting ready, he heard the cornet giving orders to his family in\nan authoritative and sensible tone, and a few minutes later he saw him\npass by the window in a tattered coat with his trousers rolled up to\nhis knees and a fishing net over his shoulder.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA rascal!\xe2\x80\x9d said Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka, emptying his \xe2\x80\x9cworldly\xe2\x80\x9d tumbler. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\nwill you really pay him six rubles? Was such a thing ever heard of?\nThey would let you the best hut in the village for two rubles. What a\nbeast! Why, I\xe2\x80\x99d let you have mine for three!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99ll remain here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSix rubles!... Clearly it\xe2\x80\x99s a fool\xe2\x80\x99s money. Eh, eh, eh!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the\nold man. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s have some _chikhir_, Iv\xc3\xa1n!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHaving had a snack and a drink of vodka to prepare themselves for the\nroad, Ol\xc3\xa9nin and the old man went out together before eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\n\nAt the gate they came up against a wagon to which a pair of oxen were\nharnessed. With a white kerchief tied round her head down to her eyes,\na coat over her smock, and wearing high boots, Mary\xc3\xa1nka with a long\nswitch in her hand was dragging the oxen by a cord tied to their horns.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMammy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, pretending that he was going to seize her.\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka flourished her switch at him and glanced merrily at them both\nwith her beautiful eyes.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin felt still more light-hearted.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, come on, come on,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, throwing his gun on his shoulder\nand conscious of the girl\xe2\x80\x99s eyes upon him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGee up!\xe2\x80\x9d sounded Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s voice behind them, followed by the creak\nof the moving wagon.\n\nAs long as their road lay through the pastures at the back of the\nvillage Er\xc3\xb3shka went on talking. He could not forget the cornet and\nkept on abusing him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you so angry with him?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s stingy. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it\nall behind when he dies! Then who\xe2\x80\x99s he saving up for? He\xe2\x80\x99s built two\nhouses, and he\xe2\x80\x99s got a second garden from his brother by a law-suit.\nAnd in the matter of papers what a dog he is! They come to him from\nother villages to fill up documents. As he writes it out, exactly so it\nhappens. He gets it quite exact. But who is he saving for? He\xe2\x80\x99s only\ngot one boy and the girl; when she\xe2\x80\x99s married who\xe2\x80\x99ll be left?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, he\xe2\x80\x99s saving up for her dowry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat dowry? The girl is sought after, she\xe2\x80\x99s a fine girl. But he\xe2\x80\x99s such\na devil that he must yet marry her to a rich fellow. He wants to get a\nbig price for her. There\xe2\x80\x99s Luke, a Cossack, a neighbour and a nephew of\nmine, a fine lad. It\xe2\x80\x99s he who killed the Ch\xc3\xa9chen\xe2\x80\x94he has been wooing her\nfor a long time, but he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t let him have her. He\xe2\x80\x99s given one excuse,\nand another, and a third. \xe2\x80\x98The girl\xe2\x80\x99s too young,\xe2\x80\x99 he says. But I know\nwhat he is thinking. He wants to keep them bowing to him. He\xe2\x80\x99s been\nacting shamefully about that girl. Still, they will get her for\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka, because he is the best Cossack in the village, a brave, who\nhas killed an _abrek_ and will be rewarded with a cross.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how about this? When I was walking up and down the yard last\nnight, I saw my landlord\xe2\x80\x99s daughter and some Cossack kissing,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nOl\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re pretending!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old man, stopping.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn my word,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWomen are the devil,\xe2\x80\x9d said Er\xc3\xb3shka pondering. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what Cossack was\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what sort of a cap had he, a white one?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a red coat? About your height?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, a bit taller.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s he!\xe2\x80\x9d and Er\xc3\xb3shka burst out laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s himself, it\xe2\x80\x99s Mark. He\nis Luke, but I call him Mark for a joke. His very self! I love him. I\nwas just such a one myself. What\xe2\x80\x99s the good of minding them? My\nsweetheart used to sleep with her mother and her sister-in-law, but I\nmanaged to get in. She used to sleep upstairs; that witch her mother\nwas a regular demon; it\xe2\x80\x99s awful how she hated me. Well, I used to come\nwith a chum, G\xc3\xadrchik his name was. We\xe2\x80\x99d come under her window and I\xe2\x80\x99d\nclimb on his shoulders, push up the window and begin groping about. She\nused to sleep just there on a bench. Once I woke her up and she nearly\ncalled out. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t recognized me. \xe2\x80\x98Who is there?\xe2\x80\x99 she said, and I\ncould not answer. Her mother was even beginning to stir, but I took off\nmy cap and shoved it over her mouth; and she at once knew it by a seam\nin it, and ran out to me. I used not to want anything then. She\xe2\x80\x99d bring\nalong clotted cream and grapes and everything,\xe2\x80\x9d added Er\xc3\xb3shka (who\nalways explained things practically), \xe2\x80\x9cand she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only one. It\nwas a life!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what now?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we\xe2\x80\x99ll follow the dog, get a pheasant to settle on a tree, and then\nyou may fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you have made up to Mary\xc3\xa1nka?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAttend to the dogs. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, pointing\nto his favourite dog, Lyam.\n\nAfter a pause they continued talking, while they went about a hundred\npaces. Then the old man stopped again and pointed to a twig that lay\nacross the path.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of that?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou think it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing? It\xe2\x80\x99s bad\nthat this stick is lying so.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is it bad?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe smiled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything. Just listen to me. When a stick lies like\nthat don\xe2\x80\x99t you step across it, but go round it or throw it off the path\nthis way, and say \xe2\x80\x98Father and Son and Holy Ghost,\xe2\x80\x99 and then go on with\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s blessing. Nothing will happen to you. That\xe2\x80\x99s what the old men\nused to teach me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, what rubbish!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better tell me more about\nMary\xc3\xa1nka. Does she carry on with Luk\xc3\xa1shka?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush ... be quiet now!\xe2\x80\x9d the old man again interrupted in a whisper:\n\xe2\x80\x9cjust listen, we\xe2\x80\x99ll go round through the forest.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the old man, stepping quietly in his soft shoes, led the way by a\nnarrow path leading into the dense, wild, overgrown forest. Now and\nagain with a frown he turned to look at Ol\xc3\xa9nin, who rustled and\nclattered with his heavy boots and, carrying his gun carelessly,\nseveral times caught the twigs of trees that grew across the path.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t make a noise. Step softly, soldier!\xe2\x80\x9d the old man whispered\nangrily.\n\nThere was a feeling in the air that the sun had risen. The mist was\ndissolving but it still enveloped the tops of the trees. The forest\nlooked terribly high. At every step the aspect changed: what had\nappeared like a tree proved to be a bush, and a reed looked like a\ntree.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XIX\n\n\nThe mist had partly lifted, showing the wet reed thatches, and was now\nturning into dew that moistened the road and the grass beside the\nfence. Smoke rose everywhere in clouds from the chimneys. The people\nwere going out of the village, some to their work, some to the river,\nand some to the cordon. The hunters walked together along the damp,\ngrass-grown path. The dogs, wagging their tails and looking at their\nmasters, ran on both sides of them. Myriads of gnats hovered in the air\nand pursued the hunters, covering their backs, eyes, and hands. The air\nwas fragrant with the grass and with the dampness of the forest. Ol\xc3\xa9nin\ncontinually looked round at the ox-cart in which Mary\xc3\xa1nka sat urging on\nthe oxen with a long switch.\n\nIt was calm. The sounds from the village, audible at first, now no\nlonger reached the sportsmen. Only the brambles cracked as the dogs ran\nunder them, and now and then birds called to one another. Ol\xc3\xa9nin knew\nthat danger lurked in the forest, that _abreks_ always hid in such\nplaces. But he knew too that in the forest, for a man on foot, a gun is\na great protection. Not that he was afraid, but he felt that another in\nhis place might be; and looking into the damp misty forest and\nlistening to the rare and faint sounds with strained attention, he\nchanged his hold on his gun and experienced a pleasant feeling that was\nnew to him. Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka went in front, stopping and carefully\nscanning every puddle where an animal had left a double track, and\npointing it out to Ol\xc3\xa9nin. He hardly spoke at all and only occasionally\nmade remarks in a whisper. The track they were following had once been\nmade by wagons, but the grass had long overgrown it. The elm and\nplane-tree forest on both sides of them was so dense and overgrown with\ncreepers that it was impossible to see anything through it. Nearly\nevery tree was enveloped from top to bottom with wild grape vines, and\ndark bramble bushes covered the ground thickly. Every little glade was\novergrown with blackberry bushes and grey feathery reeds. In places,\nlarge hoof-prints and small funnel-shaped pheasant-trails led from the\npath into the thicket. The vigour of the growth of this forest,\nuntrampled by cattle, struck Ol\xc3\xa9nin at every turn, for he had never\nseen anything like it. This forest, the danger, the old man and his\nmysterious whispering, Mary\xc3\xa1nka with her virile upright bearing, and\nthe mountains\xe2\x80\x94all this seemed to him like a dream.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA pheasant has settled,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the old man, looking round and\npulling his cap over his face\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cCover your mug! A pheasant!\xe2\x80\x9d he waved\nhis arm angrily at Ol\xc3\xa9nin and pushed forward almost on all fours. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t like a man\xe2\x80\x99s mug.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin was still behind him when the old man stopped and began\nexamining a tree. A cock-pheasant on the tree clucked at the dog that\nwas barking at it, and Ol\xc3\xa9nin saw the pheasant; but at that moment a\nreport, as of a cannon, came from Er\xc3\xb3shka\xe2\x80\x99s enormous gun, the bird\nfluttered up and, losing some feathers, fell to the ground. Coming up\nto the old man Ol\xc3\xa9nin disturbed another, and raising his gun he aimed\nand fired. The pheasant flew swiftly up and then, catching at the\nbranches as he fell, dropped like a stone to the ground.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood man!\xe2\x80\x9d the old man (who could not hit a flying bird) shouted,\nlaughing.\n\nHaving picked up the pheasants they went on. Ol\xc3\xa9nin, excited by the\nexercise and the praise, kept addressing remarks to the old man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop! Come this way,\xe2\x80\x9d the old man interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cI noticed the track of\ndeer here yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAfter they had turned into the thicket and gone some three hundred\npaces they scrambled through into a glade overgrown with reeds and\npartly under water. Ol\xc3\xa9nin failed to keep up with the old huntsman and\npresently Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka, some twenty paces in front, stooped down,\nnodding and beckoning with his arm. On coming up with him Ol\xc3\xa9nin saw a\nman\xe2\x80\x99s footprint to which the old man was pointing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you see?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, well?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin, trying to speak as calmly as he could. \xe2\x80\x9cA\nman\xe2\x80\x99s footstep!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nInvoluntarily a thought of Cooper\xe2\x80\x99s _Pathfinder_ and of _abreks_\nflashed through Ol\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s mind, but noticing the mysterious manner with\nwhich the old man moved on, he hesitated to question him and remained\nin doubt whether this mysteriousness was caused by fear of danger or by\nthe sport.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it\xe2\x80\x99s my own footprint,\xe2\x80\x9d the old man said quietly, and pointed to\nsome grass under which the track of an animal was just perceptible.\n\nThe old man went on, and Ol\xc3\xa9nin kept up with him. Descending to lower\nground some twenty paces farther on they came upon a spreading\npear-tree, under which, on the black earth, lay the fresh dung of some\nanimal.\n\nThe spot, all covered over with wild vines, was like a cosy arbour,\ndark and cool.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been here this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man with a sigh; \xe2\x80\x9cthe lair\nis still damp, quite fresh.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSuddenly they heard a terrible crash in the forest some ten paces from\nwhere they stood. They both started and seized their guns, but they\ncould see nothing and only heard the branches breaking. The rhythmical\nrapid thud of galloping was heard for a moment and then changed into a\nhollow rumble which resounded farther and farther off, re-echoing in\nwider and wider circles through the forest. Ol\xc3\xa9nin felt as though\nsomething had snapped in his heart. He peered carefully but vainly into\nthe green thicket and then turned to the old man. Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka with\nhis gun pressed to his breast stood motionless; his cap was thrust\nbackwards, his eyes gleamed with an unwonted glow, and his open mouth,\nwith its worn yellow teeth, seemed to have stiffened in that position.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA horned stag!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, and throwing down his gun in despair he\nbegan pulling at his grey beard, \xe2\x80\x9cHere it stood. We should have come\nround by the path.... Fool! fool!\xe2\x80\x9d and he gave his beard an angry tug.\n\xe2\x80\x9cFool! Pig!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, pulling painfully at his own beard. Through\nthe forest something seemed to fly away in the mist, and ever farther\nand farther off was heard the sound of the flight of the stag.\n\nIt was already dusk when, hungry, tired, but full of vigour, Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nreturned with the old man. Dinner was ready. He ate and drank with the\nold man till he felt warm and merry. Ol\xc3\xa9nin then went out into the\nporch. Again, to the west, the mountains rose before his eyes. Again\nthe old man told his endless stories of hunting, of _abreks_, of\nsweethearts, and of all that free and reckless life. Again the fair\nMary\xc3\xa1nka went in and out and across the yard, her beautiful powerful\nform outlined by her smock.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XX\n\n\nThe next day Ol\xc3\xa9nin went alone to the spot where he and the old man\nstartled the stag. Instead of passing round through the gate he climbed\nover the prickly hedge, as everybody else did, and before he had had\ntime to pull out the thorns that had caught in his coat, his dog, which\nhad run on in front, started two pheasants. He had hardly stepped among\nthe briers when the pheasants began to rise at every step (the old man\nhad not shown him that place the day before as he meant to keep it for\nshooting from behind the screen). Ol\xc3\xa9nin fired twelve times and killed\nfive pheasants, but clambering after them through the briers he got so\nfatigued that he was drenched with perspiration. He called off his dog,\nuncocked his gun, put in a bullet above the small shot, and brushing\naway the mosquitoes with the wide sleeve of his Circassian coat he went\nslowly to the spot where they had been the day before. It was however\nimpossible to keep back the dog, who found trails on the very path, and\nOl\xc3\xa9nin killed two more pheasants, so that after being detained by this\nit was getting towards noon before he began to find the place he was\nlooking for.\n\nThe day was perfectly clear, calm, and hot. The morning moisture had\ndried up even in the forest, and myriads of mosquitoes literally\ncovered his face, his back, and his arms. His dog had turned from black\nto grey, its back being covered with mosquitoes, and so had Ol\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s\ncoat through which the insects thrust their stings. Ol\xc3\xa9nin was ready to\nrun away from them and it seemed to him that it was impossible to live\nin this country in the summer. He was about to go home, but remembering\nthat other people managed to endure such pain he resolved to bear it\nand gave himself up to be devoured. And strange to say, by noontime the\nfeeling became actually pleasant. He even felt that without this\nmosquito-filled atmosphere around him, and that mosquito-paste mingled\nwith perspiration which his hand smeared over his face, and that\nunceasing irritation all over his body, the forest would lose for him\nsome of its character and charm. These myriads of insects were so well\nsuited to that monstrously lavish wild vegetation, these multitudes of\nbirds and beasts which filled the forest, this dark foliage, this hot\nscented air, these runlets filled with turbid water which everywhere\nsoaked through from the T\xc3\xa9rek and gurgled here and there under the\noverhanging leaves, that the very thing which had at first seemed to\nhim dreadful and intolerable now seemed pleasant. After going round the\nplace where yesterday they had found the animal and not finding\nanything, he felt inclined to rest. The sun stood right above the\nforest and poured its perpendicular rays down on his back and head\nwhenever he came out into a glade or onto the road. The seven heavy\npheasants dragged painfully at his waist. Having found the traces of\nyesterday\xe2\x80\x99s stag he crept under a bush into the thicket just where the\nstag had lain, and lay down in its lair. He examined the dark foliage\naround him, the place marked by the stag\xe2\x80\x99s perspiration and yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s\ndung, the imprint of the stag\xe2\x80\x99s knees, the bit of black earth it had\nkicked up, and his own footprints of the day before. He felt cool and\ncomfortable and did not think of or wish for anything. And suddenly he\nwas overcome by such a strange feeling of causeless joy and of love for\neverything, that from an old habit of his childhood he began crossing\nhimself and thanking someone. Suddenly, with extraordinary clearness,\nhe thought: \xe2\x80\x9cHere am I, Dm\xc3\xadtri Ol\xc3\xa9nin, a being quite distinct from\nevery other being, now lying all alone Heaven only knows where\xe2\x80\x94where a\nstag used to live\xe2\x80\x94an old stag, a beautiful stag who perhaps had never\nseen a man, and in a place where no human being has ever sat or thought\nthese thoughts. Here I sit, and around me stand old and young trees,\none of them festooned with wild grape vines, and pheasants are\nfluttering, driving one another about and perhaps scenting their\nmurdered brothers.\xe2\x80\x9d He felt his pheasants, examined them, and wiped the\nwarm blood off his hand onto his coat. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps the jackals scent them\nand with dissatisfied faces go off in another direction: above me,\nflying in among the leaves which to them seem enormous islands,\nmosquitoes hang in the air and buzz: one, two, three, four, a hundred,\na thousand, a million mosquitoes, and all of them buzz something or\nother and each one of them is separate from all else and is just such a\nseparate Dm\xc3\xadtri Ol\xc3\xa9nin as I am myself.\xe2\x80\x9d He vividly imagined what the\nmosquitoes buzzed: \xe2\x80\x9cThis way, this way, lads! Here\xe2\x80\x99s some one we can\neat!\xe2\x80\x9d They buzzed and stuck to him. And it was clear to him that he was\nnot a Russian nobleman, a member of Moscow society, the friend and\nrelation of so-and-so and so-and-so, but just such a mosquito, or\npheasant, or deer, as those that were now living all around him. \xe2\x80\x9cJust\nas they, just as Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka, I shall live awhile and die, and as he\nsays truly: \xe2\x80\x98grass will grow and nothing more\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what though the grass does grow?\xe2\x80\x9d he continued thinking. \xe2\x80\x9cStill I\nmust live and be happy, because happiness is all I desire. Never mind\nwhat I am\xe2\x80\x94an animal like all the rest, above whom the grass will grow\nand nothing more; or a frame in which a bit of the one God has been\nset,\xe2\x80\x94still I must live in the very best way. How then must I live to be\nhappy, and why was I not happy before?\xe2\x80\x9d And he began to recall his\nformer life and he felt disgusted with himself. He appeared to himself\nto have been terribly exacting and selfish, though he now saw that all\nthe while he really needed nothing for himself. And he looked round at\nthe foliage with the light shining through it, at the setting sun and\nthe clear sky, and he felt just as happy as before. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy am I happy,\nand what used I to live for?\xe2\x80\x9d thought he. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much I exacted for\nmyself; how I schemed and did not manage to gain anything but shame and\nsorrow! and, there now, I require nothing to be happy;\xe2\x80\x9d and suddenly a\nnew light seemed to reveal itself to him. \xe2\x80\x9cHappiness is this!\xe2\x80\x9d he said\nto himself. \xe2\x80\x9cHappiness lies in living for others. That is evident. The\ndesire for happiness is innate in every man; therefore it is\nlegitimate. When trying to satisfy it selfishly\xe2\x80\x94that is, by seeking for\noneself riches, fame, comforts, or love\xe2\x80\x94it may happen that\ncircumstances arise which make it impossible to satisfy these desires.\nIt follows that it is these desires that are illegitimate, but not the\nneed for happiness. But what desires can always be satisfied despite\nexternal circumstances? What are they? Love, self-sacrifice.\xe2\x80\x9d He was so\nglad and excited when he had discovered this, as it seemed to him, new\ntruth, that he jumped up and began impatiently seeking some one to\nsacrifice himself for, to do good to and to love. \xe2\x80\x9cSince one wants\nnothing for oneself,\xe2\x80\x9d he kept thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy not live for others?\xe2\x80\x9d He\ntook up his gun with the intention of returning home quickly to think\nthis out and to find an opportunity of doing good. He made his way out\nof the thicket. When he had come out into the glade he looked around\nhim; the sun was no longer visible above the tree-tops. It had grown\ncooler and the place seemed to him quite strange and not like the\ncountry round the village. Everything seemed changed\xe2\x80\x94the weather and\nthe character of the forest; the sky was wrapped in clouds, the wind\nwas rustling in the tree-tops, and all around nothing was visible but\nreeds and dying broken-down trees. He called to his dog who had run\naway to follow some animal, and his voice came back as in a desert. And\nsuddenly he was seized with a terrible sense of weirdness. He grew\nfrightened. He remembered the _abreks_ and the murders he had been told\nabout, and he expected every moment that an _abrek_ would spring from\nbehind every bush and he would have to defend his life and die, or be a\ncoward. He thought of God and of the future life as for long he had not\nthought about them. And all around was that same gloomy stern wild\nnature. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd is it worth while living for oneself,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen\nat any moment you may die, and die without having done any good, and so\nthat no one will know of it?\xe2\x80\x9d He went in the direction where he fancied\nthe village lay. Of his shooting he had no further thought; but he felt\ntired to death and peered round at every bush and tree with particular\nattention and almost with terror, expecting every moment to be called\nto account for his life. After having wandered about for a considerable\ntime he came upon a ditch down which was flowing cold sandy water from\nthe T\xc3\xa9rek, and, not to go astray any longer, he decided to follow it.\nHe went on without knowing where the ditch would lead him. Suddenly the\nreeds behind him crackled. He shuddered and seized his gun, and then\nfelt ashamed of himself: the over-excited dog, panting hard, had thrown\nitself into the cold water of the ditch and was lapping it!\n\nHe too had a drink, and then followed the dog in the direction it\nwished to go, thinking it would lead him to the village. But despite\nthe dog\xe2\x80\x99s company everything around him seemed still more dreary. The\nforest grew darker and the wind grew stronger and stronger in the tops\nof the broken old trees. Some large birds circled screeching round\ntheir nests in those trees. The vegetation grew poorer and he came\noftener and oftener upon rustling reeds and bare sandy spaces covered\nwith animal footprints. To the howling of the wind was added another\nkind of cheerless monotonous roar. Altogether his spirits became\ngloomy. Putting his hand behind him he felt his pheasants, and found\none missing. It had broken off and was lost, and only the bleeding head\nand beak remained sticking in his belt. He felt more frightened than he\nhad ever done before. He began to pray to God, and feared above all\nthat he might die without having done anything good or kind; and he so\nwanted to live, and to live so as to perform a feat of self-sacrifice.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXI\n\n\nSuddenly it was as though the sun had shone into his soul. He heard\nRussian being spoken, and also heard the rapid smooth flow of the\nT\xc3\xa9rek, and a few steps farther in front of him saw the brown moving\nsurface of the river, with the dim-coloured wet sand of its banks and\nshallows, the distant steppe, the cordon watch-tower outlined above the\nwater, a saddled and hobbled horse among the brambles, and then the\nmountains opening out before him. The red sun appeared for an instant\nfrom under a cloud and its last rays glittered brightly along the river\nover the reeds, on the watch-tower, and on a group of Cossacks, among\nwhom Luk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s vigorous figure attracted Ol\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s involuntary\nattention.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin felt that he was again, without any apparent cause, perfectly\nhappy. He had come upon the N\xc3\xadzhni-Prot\xc3\xb3tsk post on the T\xc3\xa9rek, opposite\na pro-Russian Tartar village on the other side of the river. He\naccosted the Cossacks, but not finding as yet any excuse for doing\nanyone a kindness, he entered the hut; nor in the hut did he find any\nsuch opportunity. The Cossacks received him coldly. On entering the mud\nhut he lit a cigarette. The Cossacks paid little attention to him,\nfirst because he was smoking a cigarette, and secondly because they had\nsomething else to divert them that evening. Some hostile Ch\xc3\xa9chens,\nrelatives of the _abrek_ who had been killed, had come from the hills\nwith a scout to ransom the body; and the Cossacks were waiting for\ntheir Commanding Officer\xe2\x80\x99s arrival from the village. The dead man\xe2\x80\x99s\nbrother, tall and well shaped with a short cropped beard which was dyed\nred, despite his very tattered coat and cap was calm and majestic as a\nking. His face was very like that of the dead _abrek_. He did not deign\nto look at anyone, and never once glanced at the dead body, but sitting\non his heels in the shade he spat as he smoked his short pipe, and\noccasionally uttered some few guttural sounds of command, which were\nrespectfully listened to by his companion. He was evidently a brave who\nhad met Russians more than once before in quite other circumstances,\nand nothing about them could astonish or even interest him. Ol\xc3\xa9nin was\nabout to approach the dead body and had begun to look at it when the\nbrother, looking up at him from under his brows with calm contempt,\nsaid something sharply and angrily. The scout hastened to cover the\ndead man\xe2\x80\x99s face with his coat. Ol\xc3\xa9nin was struck by the dignified and\nstern expression of the brave\xe2\x80\x99s face. He began to speak to him, asking\nfrom what village he came, but the Ch\xc3\xa9chen, scarcely giving him a\nglance, spat contemptuously and turned away. Ol\xc3\xa9nin was so surprised at\nthe Ch\xc3\xa9chen not being interested in him that he could only put it down\nto the man\xe2\x80\x99s stupidity or ignorance of Russian; so he turned to the\nscout, who also acted as interpreter. The scout was as ragged as the\nother, but instead of being red-haired he was black-haired, restless,\nwith extremely white gleaming teeth and sparkling black eyes. The scout\nwillingly entered into conversation and asked for a cigarette.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were five brothers,\xe2\x80\x9d began the scout in his broken Russian.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the third brother the Russians have killed, only two are left.\nHe is a brave, a great brave!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pointing to the Ch\xc3\xa9chen. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen\nthey killed Ahmet Khan (the dead brave) this one was sitting on the\nopposite bank among the reeds. He saw it all. Saw him laid in the skiff\nand brought to the bank. He sat there till the night and wished to kill\nthe old man, but the others would not let him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka went up to the speaker, and sat down. \xe2\x80\x9cOf what village?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\nhe.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom there in the hills,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the scout, pointing to the misty\nbluish gorge beyond the T\xc3\xa9rek. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know Suuk-su? It is about eight\nmiles beyond that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know Gir\xc3\xa9y Khan in Suuk-su?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Luk\xc3\xa1shka, evidently proud of\nthe acquaintance. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is my _kunak_.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is my neighbour,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the scout.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a trump!\xe2\x80\x9d and Luk\xc3\xa1shka, evidently much interested, began talking\nto the scout in Tartar.\n\nPresently a Cossack captain, with the head of the village, arrived on\nhorseback with a suite of two Cossacks. The captain\xe2\x80\x94one of the new type\nof Cossack officers\xe2\x80\x94wished the Cossacks \xe2\x80\x9cGood health,\xe2\x80\x9d but no one\nshouted in reply, \xe2\x80\x9cHail! Good health to your honour,\xe2\x80\x9d as is customary\nin the Russian Army, and only a few replied with a bow. Some, and among\nthem Luk\xc3\xa1shka, rose and stood erect. The corporal replied that all was\nwell at the outposts. All this seemed ridiculous: it was as if these\nCossacks were playing at being soldiers. But these formalities soon\ngave place to ordinary ways of behaviour, and the captain, who was a\nsmart Cossack just like the others, began speaking fluently in Tartar\nto the interpreter. They filled in some document, gave it to the scout,\nand received from him some money. Then they approached the body.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich of you is Luke Gavr\xc3\xadlov?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the captain.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka took off his cap and came forward.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have reported your exploit to the Commander. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what will\ncome of it. I have recommended you for a cross; you\xe2\x80\x99re too young to be\nmade a sergeant. Can you read?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what a fine fellow to look at!\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, again playing\nthe commander. \xe2\x80\x9cPut on your cap. Which of the Gavr\xc3\xadlovs does he come\nof? ... the Broad, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis nephew,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the corporal.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, I know. Well, lend a hand, help them,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning to the\nCossacks.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s face shone with joy and seemed handsomer than usual. He\nmoved away from the corporal, and having put on his cap sat down beside\nOl\xc3\xa9nin.\n\nWhen the body had been carried to the skiff the brother Ch\xc3\xa9chen\ndescended to the bank. The Cossacks involuntarily stepped aside to let\nhim pass. He jumped into the boat and pushed off from the bank with his\npowerful leg, and now, as Ol\xc3\xa9nin noticed, for the first time threw a\nrapid glance at all the Cossacks and then abruptly asked his companion\na question. The latter answered something and pointed to Luk\xc3\xa1shka. The\nCh\xc3\xa9chen looked at him and, turning slowly away, gazed at the opposite\nbank. That look expressed not hatred but cold contempt. He again made\nsome remark.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is he saying?\xe2\x80\x9d Ol\xc3\xa9nin asked of the fidgety scout.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYours kill ours, ours slay yours. It\xe2\x80\x99s always the same,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the\nscout, evidently inventing, and he smiled, showing his white teeth, as\nhe jumped into the skiff.\n\nThe dead man\xe2\x80\x99s brother sat motionless, gazing at the opposite bank. He\nwas so full of hatred and contempt that there was nothing on this side\nof the river that moved his curiosity. The scout, standing up at one\nend of the skiff and dipping his paddle now on one side now on the\nother, steered skilfully while talking incessantly. The skiff became\nsmaller and smaller as it moved obliquely across the stream, the voices\nbecame scarcely audible, and at last, still within sight, they landed\non the opposite bank where their horses stood waiting. There they\nlifted out the corpse and (though the horse shied) laid it across one\nof the saddles, mounted, and rode at a foot-pace along the road past a\nTartar village from which a crowd came out to look at them. The\nCossacks on the Russian side of the river were highly satisfied and\njovial. Laughter and jokes were heard on all sides. The captain and the\nhead of the village entered the mud hut to regale themselves. Luk\xc3\xa1shka,\nvainly striving to impart a sedate expression to his merry face, sat\ndown with his elbows on his knees beside Ol\xc3\xa9nin and whittled away at a\nstick.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you smoke?\xe2\x80\x9d he said with assumed curiosity. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it good?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe evidently spoke because he noticed Ol\xc3\xa9nin felt ill at ease and\nisolated among the Cossacks.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just a habit,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ol\xc3\xa9nin. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m, if one of us were to smoke there would be a row! Look there now,\nthe mountains are not far off,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Luk\xc3\xa1shka, \xe2\x80\x9cyet you can\xe2\x80\x99t get\nthere! How will you get back alone? It\xe2\x80\x99s getting dark. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you,\nif you like. You ask the corporal to give me leave.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fine fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Ol\xc3\xa9nin, looking at the Cossack\xe2\x80\x99s bright\nface. He remembered Mary\xc3\xa1nka and the kiss he had heard by the gate, and\nhe was sorry for Luk\xc3\xa1shka and his want of culture. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat confusion it\nis,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cA man kills another and is happy and satisfied with\nhimself as if he had done something excellent. Can it be that nothing\ntells him that it is not a reason for any rejoicing, and that happiness\nlies not in killing, but in sacrificing oneself?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you had better not meet him again now, mate!\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the\nCossacks who had seen the skiff off, addressing Luk\xc3\xa1shka. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear\nhim asking about you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka raised his head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy godson?\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, meaning by that word the dead Ch\xc3\xa9chen.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour godson won\xe2\x80\x99t rise, but the red one is the godson\xe2\x80\x99s brother!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him thank God that he got off whole himself,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Luk\xc3\xa1shka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you glad about?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin. \xe2\x80\x9cSupposing your brother had\nbeen killed; would you be glad?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Cossack looked at Ol\xc3\xa9nin with laughing eyes. He seemed to have\nunderstood all that Ol\xc3\xa9nin wished to say to him, but to be above such\nconsiderations.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that happens too! Don\xe2\x80\x99t our fellows get killed sometimes?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXII\n\n\nThe Captain and the head of the village rode away, and Ol\xc3\xa9nin, to\nplease Luk\xc3\xa1shka as well as to avoid going back alone through the dark\nforest, asked the corporal to give Luk\xc3\xa1shka leave, and the corporal did\nso. Ol\xc3\xa9nin thought that Luk\xc3\xa1shka wanted to see Mary\xc3\xa1nka and he was also\nglad of the companionship of such a pleasant-looking and sociable\nCossack. Luk\xc3\xa1shka and Mary\xc3\xa1nka he involuntarily united in his mind, and\nhe found pleasure in thinking about them. \xe2\x80\x9cHe loves Mary\xc3\xa1nka,\xe2\x80\x9d thought\nOl\xc3\xa9nin, \xe2\x80\x9cand I could love her,\xe2\x80\x9d and a new and powerful emotion of\ntenderness overcame him as they walked homewards together through the\ndark forest. Luk\xc3\xa1shka too felt happy; something akin to love made\nitself felt between these two very different young men. Every time they\nglanced at one another they wanted to laugh.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy which gate do you enter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the middle one. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you as far as the marsh. After that\nyou have nothing to fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin laughed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I am afraid? Go back, and thank you. I can get on alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right! What have I to do? And how can you help being afraid?\nEven we are afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka to set Ol\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s self-esteem at rest,\nand he laughed too.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen come in with me. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have a talk and a drink and in the morning\nyou can go back.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I find a place to spend the night?\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Luk\xc3\xa1shka. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\nthe corporal asked me to go back.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard you singing last night, and also saw you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery one...\xe2\x80\x9d and Luke swayed his head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it true you are getting married?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother wants me to marry. But I have not got a horse yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you in the regular service?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear no! I\xe2\x80\x99ve only just joined, and have not got a horse yet, and\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know how to get one. That\xe2\x80\x99s why the marriage does not come off.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what would a horse cost?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were bargaining for one beyond the river the other day and they\nwould not take sixty rubles for it, though it is a Nog\xc3\xa1y horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you come and be my drab\xc3\xa1nt?\xe2\x80\x9d (A drab\xc3\xa1nt was a kind of orderly\nattached to an officer when campaigning.) \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll get it arranged and\nwill give you a horse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cReally now, I have two\nand I don\xe2\x80\x99t want both.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t want it?\xe2\x80\x9d Luk\xc3\xa1shka said, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should you make me a\npresent? We\xe2\x80\x99ll get on by ourselves by God\xe2\x80\x99s help.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, really! Or don\xe2\x80\x99t you want to be a drab\xc3\xa1nt?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin, glad that\nit had entered his head to give a horse to Luk\xc3\xa1shka, though, without\nknowing why, he felt uncomfortable and confused and did not know what\nto say when he tried to speak.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka was the first to break the silence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you a house of your own in Russia?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin could not refrain from replying that he had not only one, but\nseveral houses.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good house? Bigger than ours?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Luk\xc3\xa1shka good-naturedly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch bigger; ten times as big and three storeys high,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have you horses such as ours?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a hundred horses, worth three or four hundred rubles each, but\nthey are not like yours. They are trotters, you know.... But still, I\nlike the horses here best.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and did you come here of your own free will, or were you sent?\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Luk\xc3\xa1shka, laughing at him. \xe2\x80\x9cLook! that\xe2\x80\x99s where you lost your way,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe added, \xe2\x80\x9cyou should have turned to the right.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came by my own wish,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ol\xc3\xa9nin. \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to see your parts\nand to join some expeditions.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would go on an expedition any day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka. \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you hear the\njackals howling?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, listening.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, don\xe2\x80\x99t you feel any horror at having killed a man?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\nOl\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s there to be frightened about? But I should like to join an\nexpedition,\xe2\x80\x9d Luk\xc3\xa1shka repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cHow I want to! How I want to!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps we may be going together. Our company is going before the\nholidays, and your \xe2\x80\x98hundred\xe2\x80\x99 too.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did you want to come here for? You\xe2\x80\x99ve a house and horses and\nserfs. In your place I\xe2\x80\x99d do nothing but make merry! And what is your\nrank?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a cadet, but have been recommended for a commission.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you\xe2\x80\x99re not bragging about your home, if I were you I\xe2\x80\x99d never\nhave left it! Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99d never have gone away anywhere. Do you find it\npleasant living among us?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, very pleasant,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\nIt had grown quite dark before, talking in this way, they approached\nthe village. They were still surrounded by the deep gloom of the\nforest. The wind howled through the tree-tops. The jackals suddenly\nseemed to be crying close beside them, howling, chuckling, and sobbing;\nbut ahead of them in the village the sounds of women\xe2\x80\x99s voices and the\nbarking of dogs could already be heard; the outlines of the huts were\nclearly to be seen; lights gleamed and the air was filled with the\npeculiar smell of _kisyak_ smoke. Ol\xc3\xa9nin felt keenly, that night\nespecially, that here in this village was his home, his family, all his\nhappiness, and that he never had and never would live so happily\nanywhere as he did in this Cossack village. He was so fond of everybody\nand especially of Luk\xc3\xa1shka that night. On reaching home, to Luk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s\ngreat surprise, Ol\xc3\xa9nin with his own hands led out of the shed a horse\nhe had bought in Gr\xc3\xb3znoe\xe2\x80\x94it was not the one he usually rode but\nanother\xe2\x80\x94not a bad horse though no longer young, and gave it to\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should you give me a present?\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, \xe2\x80\x9cI have not yet done\nanything for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally it is nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ol\xc3\xa9nin. \xe2\x80\x9cTake it, and you will give me\na present, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll go on an expedition against the enemy together.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka became confused.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what d\xe2\x80\x99you mean by it? As if a horse were of little value,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid without looking at the horse.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it, take it! If you don\xe2\x80\x99t you will offend me. Vany\xc3\xbasha! Take the\ngrey horse to his house.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka took hold of the halter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, thank you! This is something unexpected, undreamt of.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin was as happy as a boy of twelve.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTie it up here. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good horse. I bought it in Gr\xc3\xb3znoe; it gallops\nsplendidly! Vany\xc3\xbasha, bring us some _chikhir_. Come into the hut.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe wine was brought. Luk\xc3\xa1shka sat down and took the wine-bowl.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod willing I\xe2\x80\x99ll find a way to repay you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, finishing his\nwine. \xe2\x80\x9cHow are you called?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDm\xc3\xadtri Andr\xc3\xa9ich.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, \xe2\x80\x99Mitry Andr\xc3\xa9ich, God bless you. We will be _kunaks_. Now you\nmust come to see us. Though we are not rich people still we can treat a\n_kunak_, and I will tell mother in case you need anything\xe2\x80\x94clotted cream\nor grapes\xe2\x80\x94and if you come to the cordon I\xe2\x80\x99m your servant to go hunting\nor to go across the river, anywhere you like! There now, only the other\nday, what a boar I killed, and I divided it among the Cossacks, but if\nI had only known, I\xe2\x80\x99d have given it to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right, thank you! But don\xe2\x80\x99t harness the horse, it has never\nbeen in harness.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy harness the horse? And there is something else I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you if\nyou like,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, bending his head. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a _kunak_, Gir\xc3\xa9y\nKhan. He asked me to lie in ambush by the road where they come down\nfrom the mountains. Shall we go together? I\xe2\x80\x99ll not betray you. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be\nyour _murid_.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we\xe2\x80\x99ll go; we\xe2\x80\x99ll go some day.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka seemed quite to have quieted down and to have understood\nOl\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s attitude towards him. His calmness and the ease of his\nbehaviour surprised Ol\xc3\xa9nin, and he did not even quite like it. They\ntalked long, and it was late when Luk\xc3\xa1shka, not tipsy (he never was\ntipsy) but having drunk a good deal, left Ol\xc3\xa9nin after shaking hands.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin looked out of the window to see what he would do. Luk\xc3\xa1shka went\nout, hanging his head. Then, having led the horse out of the gate, he\nsuddenly shook his head, threw the reins of the halter over its head,\nsprang onto its back like a cat, gave a wild shout, and galloped down\nthe street. Ol\xc3\xa9nin expected that Luk\xc3\xa1shka would go to share his joy\nwith Mary\xc3\xa1nka, but though he did not do so Ol\xc3\xa9nin still felt his soul\nmore at ease than ever before in his life. He was as delighted as a\nboy, and could not refrain from telling Vany\xc3\xbasha not only that he had\ngiven Luk\xc3\xa1shka the horse, but also why he had done it, as well as his\nnew theory of happiness.\n\nVany\xc3\xbasha did not approve of his theory, and announced that \xe2\x80\x9c_l\xe2\x80\x99argent\nil n\xe2\x80\x99y a pas!_\xe2\x80\x9d and that therefore it was all nonsense.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka rode home, jumped off the horse, and handed it over to his\nmother, telling her to let it out with the communal Cossack herd. He\nhimself had to return to the cordon that same night. His deaf sister\nundertook to take the horse, and explained by signs that when she saw\nthe man who had given the horse, she would bow down at his feet. The\nold woman only shook her head at her son\xe2\x80\x99s story, and decided in her\nown mind that he had stolen it. She therefore told the deaf girl to\ntake it to the herd before daybreak.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka went back alone to the cordon pondering over Ol\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s action.\nThough he did not consider the horse a good one, yet it was worth at\nleast forty rubles and Luk\xc3\xa1shka was very glad to have the present. But\nwhy it had been given him he could not at all understand, and therefore\nhe did not experience the least feeling of gratitude. On the contrary,\nvague suspicions that the cadet had some evil intentions filled his\nmind. What those intentions were he could not decide, but neither could\nhe admit the idea that a stranger would give him a horse worth forty\nrubles for nothing, just out of kindness; it seemed impossible. Had he\nbeen drunk one might understand it! He might have wished to show off.\nBut the cadet had been sober, and therefore must have wished to bribe\nhim to do something wrong. \xe2\x80\x9cEh, humbug!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Luk\xc3\xa1shka. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t I\ngot the horse and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see later on. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a fool myself and we\nshall see who\xe2\x80\x99ll get the better of the other,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, feeling the\nnecessity of being on his guard, and therefore arousing in himself\nunfriendly feelings towards Ol\xc3\xa9nin. He told no one how he had got the\nhorse. To some he said he had bought it, to others he replied\nevasively. However, the truth soon got about in the village, and\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s mother and Mary\xc3\xa1nka, as well as Elias Vas\xc3\xadlich and other\nCossacks, when they heard of Ol\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s unnecessary gift, were perplexed,\nand began to be on their guard against the cadet. But despite their\nfears his action aroused in them a great respect for his simplicity and\nwealth.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you heard,\xe2\x80\x9d said one, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the cadet quartered on Elias Vas\xc3\xadlich\nhas thrown a fifty-ruble horse at Luk\xc3\xa1shka? He\xe2\x80\x99s rich! ...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I heard of it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied another profoundly, \xe2\x80\x9che must have done\nhim some great service. We shall see what will come of this cadet. Eh!\nwhat luck that Snatcher has!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose cadets are crafty, awfully crafty,\xe2\x80\x9d said a third. \xe2\x80\x9cSee if he\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t go setting fire to a building, or doing something!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXIII\n\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s life went on with monotonous regularity. He had little\nintercourse with the commanding officers or with his equals. The\nposition of a rich cadet in the Caucasus was peculiarly advantageous in\nthis respect. He was not sent out to work, or for training. As a reward\nfor going on an expedition he was recommended for a commission, and\nmeanwhile he was left in peace. The officers regarded him as an\naristocrat and behaved towards him with dignity. Cardplaying and the\nofficers\xe2\x80\x99 carousals accompanied by the soldier-singers, of which he had\nhad experience when he was with the detachment, did not seem to him\nattractive, and he also avoided the society and life of the officers in\nthe village. The life of officers stationed in a Cossack village has\nlong had its own definite form. Just as every cadet or officer when in\na fort regularly drinks porter, plays cards, and discusses the rewards\ngiven for taking part in the expeditions, so in the Cossack villages he\nregularly drinks _chikhir_ with his hosts, treats the girls to\nsweet-meats and honey, dangles after the Cossack women, and falls in\nlove, and occasionally marries there. Ol\xc3\xa9nin always took his own path\nand had an unconscious objection to the beaten tracks. And here, too,\nhe did not follow the ruts of a Caucasian officer\xe2\x80\x99s life.\n\nIt came quite naturally to him to wake up at daybreak. After drinking\ntea and admiring from his porch the mountains, the morning, and\nMary\xc3\xa1nka, he would put on a tattered ox-hide coat, sandals of soaked\nraw hide, buckle on a dagger, take a gun, put cigarettes and some lunch\nin a little bag, call his dog, and soon after five o\xe2\x80\x99clock would start\nfor the forest beyond the village. Towards seven in the evening he\nwould return tired and hungry with five or six pheasants hanging from\nhis belt (sometimes with some other animal) and with his bag of food\nand cigarettes untouched. If the thoughts in his head had lain like the\nlunch and cigarettes in the bag, one might have seen that during all\nthose fourteen hours not a single thought had moved in it. He returned\nmorally fresh, strong, and perfectly happy, and he could not tell what\nhe had been thinking about all the time. Were they ideas, memories, or\ndreams that had been flitting through his mind? They were frequently\nall three. He would rouse himself and ask what he had been thinking\nabout; and would see himself as a Cossack working in a vineyard with\nhis Cossack wife, or an _abrek_ in the mountains, or a boar running\naway from himself. And all the time he kept peering and watching for a\npheasant, a boar, or a deer.\n\nIn the evening Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka would be sure to be sitting with him.\nVany\xc3\xbasha would bring a jug of _chikhir_, and they would converse\nquietly, drink, and separate to go quite contentedly to bed. The next\nday he would again go shooting, again be healthily weary, again they\nwould sit conversing and drink their fill, and again be happy.\nSometimes on a holiday or day of rest Ol\xc3\xa9nin spent the whole day at\nhome. Then his chief occupation was watching Mary\xc3\xa1nka, whose every\nmovement, without realizing it himself, he followed greedily from his\nwindow or his porch. He regarded Mary\xc3\xa1nka and loved her (so he thought)\njust as he loved the beauty of the mountains and the sky, and he had no\nthought of entering into any relations with her. It seemed to him that\nbetween him and her such relations as there were between her and the\nCossack Luk\xc3\xa1shka could not exist, and still less such as often existed\nbetween rich officers and other Cossack girls. It seemed to him that if\nhe tried to do as his fellow officers did, he would exchange his\ncomplete enjoyment of contemplation for an abyss of suffering,\ndisillusionment, and remorse. Besides, he had already achieved a\ntriumph of self-sacrifice in connexion with her which had given him\ngreat pleasure, and above all he was in a way afraid of Mary\xc3\xa1nka and\nwould not for anything have ventured to utter a word of love to her\nlightly.\n\nOnce during the summer, when Ol\xc3\xa9nin had not gone out shooting but was\nsitting at home, quite unexpectedly a Moscow acquaintance, a very young\nman whom he had met in society, came in.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, _mon cher_, my dear fellow, how glad I was when I heard that you\nwere here!\xe2\x80\x9d he began in his Moscow French, and he went on intermingling\nFrench words in his remarks. \xe2\x80\x9cThey said, \xe2\x80\x98Ol\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99. What Ol\xc3\xa9nin? and I\nwas so pleased.... Fancy fate bringing us together here! Well, and how\nare you? How? Why?\xe2\x80\x9d and Prince Bel\xc3\xa9tski told his whole story: how he\nhad temporarily entered the regiment, how the Commander-in-Chief had\noffered to take him as an adjutant, and how he would take up the post\nafter this campaign although personally he felt quite indifferent about\nit.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLiving here in this hole one must at least make a career\xe2\x80\x94get a\ncross\xe2\x80\x94or a rank\xe2\x80\x94be transferred to the Guards. That is quite\nindispensable, not for myself but for the sake of my relations and\nfriends. The prince received me very well; he is a very decent fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Bel\xc3\xa9tski, and went on unceasingly. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been recommended for\nthe St. Anna Cross for the expedition. Now I shall stay here a bit\nuntil we start on the campaign. It\xe2\x80\x99s capital here. What women! Well,\nand how are you getting on? I was told by our captain, St\xc3\xa1rtsev you\nknow, a kind-hearted stupid creature.... Well, he said you were living\nlike an awful savage, seeing no one! I quite understand you don\xe2\x80\x99t want\nto be mixed up with the set of officers we have here. I am so glad now\nyou and I will be able to see something of one another. I have put up\nat the Cossack corporal\xe2\x80\x99s house. There is such a girl there. \xc3\x9astenka! I\ntell you she\xe2\x80\x99s just charming.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd more and more French and Russian words came pouring forth from that\nworld which Ol\xc3\xa9nin thought he had left for ever. The general opinion\nabout Bel\xc3\xa9tski was that he was a nice, good-natured fellow. Perhaps he\nreally was; but in spite of his pretty, good-natured face, Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nthought him extremely unpleasant. He seemed just to exhale that\nfilthiness which Ol\xc3\xa9nin had forsworn. What vexed him most was that he\ncould not\xe2\x80\x94had not the strength\xe2\x80\x94abruptly to repulse this man who came\nfrom that world: as if that old world he used to belong to had an\nirresistible claim on him. Ol\xc3\xa9nin felt angry with Bel\xc3\xa9tski and with\nhimself, yet against his wish he introduced French phrases into his own\nconversation, was interested in the Commander-in-Chief and in their\nMoscow acquaintances, and because in this Cossack village he and\nBel\xc3\xa9tski both spoke French, he spoke contemptuously of their fellow\nofficers and of the Cossacks, and was friendly with Bel\xc3\xa9tski, promising\nto visit him and inviting him to drop in to see him. Ol\xc3\xa9nin however did\nnot himself go to see Bel\xc3\xa9tski. Vany\xc3\xbasha for his part approved of\nBel\xc3\xa9tski, remarking that he was a real gentleman.\n\nBel\xc3\xa9tski at once adopted the customary life of a rich officer in a\nCossack village. Before Ol\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, in one month he came to be like\nan old resident of the village; he made the old men drunk, arranged\nevening parties, and himself went to parties arranged by the\ngirls\xe2\x80\x94bragged of his conquests, and even got so far that, for some\nunknown reason, the women and girls began calling him grandad, and the\nCossacks, to whom a man who loved wine and women was clearly\nunderstandable, got used to him and even liked him better than they did\nOl\xc3\xa9nin, who was a puzzle to them.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXIV\n\n\nIt was five in the morning. Vany\xc3\xbasha was in the porch heating the\nsamovar, and using the leg of a long boot instead of bellows. Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nhad already ridden off to bathe in the T\xc3\xa9rek. (He had recently invented\na new amusement: to swim his horse in the river.) His landlady was in\nher outhouse, and the dense smoke of the kindling fire rose from the\nchimney. The girl was milking the buffalo cow in the shed. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t keep\nquiet, the damned thing!\xe2\x80\x9d came her impatient voice, followed by the\nrhythmical sound of milking.\n\nFrom the street in front of the house horses\xe2\x80\x99 hoofs were heard\nclattering briskly, and Ol\xc3\xa9nin, riding bareback on a handsome dark-grey\nhorse which was still wet and shining, rode up to the gate. Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s\nhandsome head, tied round with a red kerchief, appeared from the shed\nand again disappeared. Ol\xc3\xa9nin was wearing a red silk shirt, a white\nCircassian coat girdled with a strap which carried a dagger, and a tall\ncap. He sat his well-fed wet horse with a slightly conscious elegance\nand, holding his gun at his back, stooped to open the gate. His hair\nwas still wet, and his face shone with youth and health. He thought\nhimself handsome, agile, and like a brave; but he was mistaken. To any\nexperienced Caucasian he was still only a soldier. When he noticed that\nthe girl had put out her head he stooped with particular smartness,\nthrew open the gate and, tightening the reins, swished his whip and\nentered the yard. \xe2\x80\x9cIs tea ready, Vany\xc3\xbasha?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried gaily, not looking\nat the door of the shed. He felt with pleasure how his fine horse,\npressing down its flanks, pulling at the bridle and with every muscle\nquivering and with each foot ready to leap over the fence, pranced on\nthe hard clay of the yard. _\xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x99est pr\xc3\xaat_,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Vany\xc3\xbasha. Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nfelt as if Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful head was still looking out of the shed\nbut he did not turn to look at her. As he jumped down from his horse he\nmade an awkward movement and caught his gun against the porch, and\nturned a frightened look towards the shed, where there was no one to be\nseen and whence the sound of milking could still be heard.\n\nSoon after he had entered the hut he came out again and sat down with\nhis pipe and a book on the side of the porch which was not yet exposed\nto the rays of the sun. He meant not to go anywhere before dinner that\nday, and to write some long-postponed letters; but somehow he felt\ndisinclined to leave his place in the porch, and he was as reluctant to\ngo back into the hut as if it had been a prison. The housewife had\nheated her oven, and the girl, having driven the cattle, had come back\nand was collecting _kisyak_ and heaping it up along the fence. Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nwent on reading, but did not understand a word of what was written in\nthe book that lay open before him. He kept lifting his eyes from it and\nlooking at the powerful young woman who was moving about. Whether she\nstepped into the moist morning shadow thrown by the house, or went out\ninto the middle of the yard lit up by the joyous young light, so that\nthe whole of her stately figure in its bright coloured garment gleamed\nin the sunshine and cast a black shadow\xe2\x80\x94he always feared to lose any\none of her movements. It delighted him to see how freely and gracefully\nher figure bent: into what folds her only garment, a pink smock, draped\nitself on her bosom and along her shapely legs; how she drew herself up\nand her tight-drawn smock showed the outline of her heaving bosom, how\nthe soles of her narrow feet in her worn red slippers rested on the\nground without altering their shape; how her strong arms with the\nsleeves rolled up, exerting the muscles, used the spade almost as if in\nanger, and how her deep dark eyes sometimes glanced at him. Though the\ndelicate brows frowned, yet her eyes expressed pleasure and a knowledge\nof her own beauty.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Ol\xc3\xa9nin, have you been up long?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bel\xc3\xa9tski as he entered the\nyard dressed in the coat of a Caucasian officer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Bel\xc3\xa9tski,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ol\xc3\xa9nin, holding out his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cHow is it you\nare out so early?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had to. I was driven out; we are having a ball tonight. Mary\xc3\xa1nka, of\ncourse you\xe2\x80\x99ll come to \xc3\x9astenka\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, turning to the girl.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin felt surprised that Bel\xc3\xa9tski could address this woman so easily.\nBut Mary\xc3\xa1nka, as though she had not heard him, bent her head, and\nthrowing the spade across her shoulder went with her firm masculine\ntread towards the outhouse.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s shy, the wench is shy,\xe2\x80\x9d Bel\xc3\xa9tski called after her. \xe2\x80\x9cShy of you,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe added as, smiling gaily, he ran up the steps of the porch.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is it you are having a ball and have been driven out?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s at \xc3\x9astenka\xe2\x80\x99s, at my landlady\xe2\x80\x99s, that the ball is, and you two are\ninvited. A ball consists of a pie and a gathering of girls.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat should we do there?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBel\xc3\xa9tski smiled knowingly and winked, jerking his head in the direction\nof the outhouse into which Mary\xc3\xa1nka had disappeared.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin shrugged his shoulders and blushed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, really you are a strange fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome now, don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin frowned, and Bel\xc3\xa9tski noticing this smiled insinuatingly. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\ncome, what do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cliving in the same house\xe2\x80\x94and such a\nfine girl, a splendid girl, a perfect beauty\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWonderfully beautiful! I never saw such a woman before,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\nOl\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bel\xc3\xa9tski, quite unable to understand the situation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be strange,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ol\xc3\xa9nin, \xe2\x80\x9cbut why should I not say what is\ntrue? Since I have lived here women don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to exist for me. And it\nis so good, really! Now what can there be in common between us and\nwomen like these? Er\xc3\xb3shka\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s a different matter! He and I have a\npassion in common\xe2\x80\x94sport.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now! In common! And what have I in common with Am\xc3\xa1lia Iv\xc3\xa1novna?\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s the same thing! You may say they\xe2\x80\x99re not very clean\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s another\nmatter... _\xc3\x80 la guerre, comme \xc3\xa0 la guerre!_...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have never known any Am\xc3\xa1lia Iv\xc3\xa1novas, and have never known how\nto behave with women of that sort,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ol\xc3\xa9nin. \xe2\x80\x9cOne cannot respect\nthem, but these I do respect.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell go on respecting them! Who wants to prevent you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin did not reply. He evidently wanted to complete what he had begun\nto say. It was very near his heart.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know I am an exception...\xe2\x80\x9d He was visibly confused. \xe2\x80\x9cBut my life has\nso shaped itself that I not only see no necessity to renounce my rules,\nbut I could not live here, let alone live as happily as I am doing,\nwere I to live as you do. Therefore I look for something quite\ndifferent from what you look for.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBel\xc3\xa9tski raised his eyebrows incredulously. \xe2\x80\x9cAnyhow, come to me this\nevening; Mary\xc3\xa1nka will be there and I will make you acquainted. Do\ncome, please! If you feel dull you can go away. Will you come?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would come, but to speak frankly I am afraid of being seriously\ncarried away.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, oh, oh!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Bel\xc3\xa9tski. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly come, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll see that you\naren\xe2\x80\x99t. Will you? On your word?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would come, but really I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what we shall do; what\npart we shall play!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, I beg of you. You will come?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, perhaps I\xe2\x80\x99ll come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally now! Charming women such as one sees nowhere else, and to live\nlike a monk! What an idea! Why spoil your life and not make use of what\nis at hand? Have you heard that our company is ordered to\nVozdv\xc3\xadzhensk?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHardly. I was told the 8th Company would be sent there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I have had a letter from the adjutant there. He writes that the\nPrince himself will take part in the campaign. I am very glad I shall\nsee something of him. I\xe2\x80\x99m beginning to get tired of this place.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear we shall start on a raid soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not heard of it; but I have heard that Krinov\xc3\xadtsin has received\nthe Order of St. Anna for a raid. He expected a lieutenancy,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nBel\xc3\xa9tski laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was let in! He has set off for headquarters.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was growing dusk and Ol\xc3\xa9nin began thinking about the party. The\ninvitation he had received worried him. He felt inclined to go, but\nwhat might take place there seemed strange, absurd, and even rather\nalarming. He knew that neither Cossack men nor older women, nor anyone\nbesides the girls, were to be there. What was going to happen? How was\nhe to behave? What would they talk about? What connexion was there\nbetween him and those wild Cossack girls? Bel\xc3\xa9tski had told him of such\ncurious, cynical, and yet rigid relations. It seemed strange to think\nthat he would be there in the same hut with Mary\xc3\xa1nka and perhaps might\nhave to talk to her. It seemed to him impossible when he remembered her\nmajestic bearing. But Bel\xc3\xa9tski spoke of it as if it were all perfectly\nsimple. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible that Bel\xc3\xa9tski will treat Mary\xc3\xa1nka in the same\nway? That is interesting,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, better not go. It\xe2\x80\x99s all so\nhorrid, so vulgar, and above all\xe2\x80\x94it leads to nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d But again he was\nworried by the question of what would take place; and besides he felt\nas if bound by a promise. He went out without having made up his mind\none way or the other, but he walked as far as Bel\xc3\xa9tski\xe2\x80\x99s, and went in\nthere.\n\nThe hut in which Bel\xc3\xa9tski lived was like Ol\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s. It was raised nearly\nfive feet from the ground on wooden piles, and had two rooms. In the\nfirst (which Ol\xc3\xa9nin entered by the steep flight of steps) feather beds,\nrugs, blankets, and cushions were tastefully and handsomely arranged,\nCossack fashion, along the main wall. On the side wall hung brass\nbasins and weapons, while on the floor, under a bench, lay watermelons\nand pumpkins. In the second room there was a big brick oven, a table,\nand sectarian icons. It was here that Bel\xc3\xa9tski was quartered, with his\ncamp-bed and his pack and trunks. His weapons hung on the wall with a\nlittle rug behind them, and on the table were his toilet appliances and\nsome portraits. A silk dressing-gown had been thrown on the bench.\nBel\xc3\xa9tski himself, clean and good-looking, lay on the bed in his\nunderclothing, reading _Les Trois Mousquetaires_.\n\nHe jumped up.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, you see how I have arranged things. Fine! Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s good that\nyou have come. They are working furiously. Do you know what the pie is\nmade of? Dough with a stuffing of pork and grapes. But that\xe2\x80\x99s not the\npoint. You just look at the commotion out there!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd really, on looking out of the window they saw an unusual bustle\ngoing on in the hut. Girls ran in and out, now for one thing and now\nfor another.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill it soon be ready?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bel\xc3\xa9tski.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery soon! Why? Is Grandad hungry?\xe2\x80\x9d and from the hut came the sound of\nringing laughter.\n\n\xc3\x9astenka, plump, small, rosy, and pretty, with her sleeves turned up,\nran into Bel\xc3\xa9tski\xe2\x80\x99s hut to fetch some plates.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet away or I shall smash the plates!\xe2\x80\x9d she squeaked, escaping from\nBel\xc3\xa9tski. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better come and help,\xe2\x80\x9d she shouted to Ol\xc3\xa9nin,\nlaughing. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to get some refreshments for the girls.\xe2\x80\x9d\n(\xe2\x80\x9cRefreshments\xe2\x80\x9d meaning spicebread and sweets.)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd has Mary\xc3\xa1nka come?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course! She brought some dough.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bel\xc3\xa9tski, \xe2\x80\x9cif one were to dress \xc3\x9astenka up and\nclean and polish her up a bit, she\xe2\x80\x99d be better than all our beauties.\nHave you ever seen that Cossack woman who married a colonel; she was\ncharming! B\xc3\xb3rsheva? What dignity! Where do they get it...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not seen B\xc3\xb3rsheva, but I think nothing could be better than the\ncostume they wear here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I\xe2\x80\x99m first-rate at fitting into any kind of life,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bel\xc3\xa9tski\nwith a sigh of pleasure. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go and see what they are up to.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe threw his dressing-gown over his shoulders and ran out, shouting,\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you look after the \xe2\x80\x98refreshments\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin sent Bel\xc3\xa9tski\xe2\x80\x99s orderly to buy spice-bread and honey; but it\nsuddenly seemed to him so disgusting to give money (as if he were\nbribing someone) that he gave no definite reply to the orderly\xe2\x80\x99s\nquestion: \xe2\x80\x9cHow much spice-bread with peppermint, and how much with\nhoney?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I spend all the money,\xe2\x80\x9d asked the old soldier impressively. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\npeppermint is dearer. It\xe2\x80\x99s sixteen kopeks.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, spend it all,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ol\xc3\xa9nin and sat down by the window,\nsurprised that his heart was thumping as if he were preparing himself\nfor something serious and wicked.\n\nHe heard screaming and shrieking in the girls\xe2\x80\x99 hut when Bel\xc3\xa9tski went\nthere, and a few moments later saw how he jumped out and ran down the\nsteps, accompanied by shrieks, bustle, and laughter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurned out,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nA little later \xc3\x9astenka entered and solemnly invited her visitors to\ncome in: announcing that all was ready.\n\nWhen they came into the room they saw that everything was really ready.\n\xc3\x9astenka was rearranging the cushions along the wall. On the table,\nwhich was covered by a disproportionately small cloth, was a decanter\nof _chikhir_ and some dried fish. The room smelt of dough and grapes.\nSome half dozen girls in smart tunics, with their heads not covered as\nusual with kerchiefs, were huddled together in a corner behind the\noven, whispering, giggling, and spluttering with laughter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI humbly beg you to do honour to my patron saint,\xe2\x80\x9d said \xc3\x9astenka,\ninviting her guests to the table.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin noticed Mary\xc3\xa1nka among the group of girls, who without exception\nwere all handsome, and he felt vexed and hurt that he met her in such\nvulgar and awkward circumstances. He felt stupid and awkward, and made\nup his mind to do what Bel\xc3\xa9tski did. Bel\xc3\xa9tski stepped to the table\nsomewhat solemnly yet with confidence and ease, drank a glass of wine\nto \xc3\x9astenka\xe2\x80\x99s health, and invited the others to do the same. \xc3\x9astenka\nannounced that girls don\xe2\x80\x99t drink.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe might with a little honey,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed a voice from among the group\nof girls.\n\nThe orderly, who had just returned with the honey and spice-cakes, was\ncalled in. He looked askance (whether with envy or with contempt) at\nthe gentlemen, who in his opinion were on the spree; and carefully and\nconscientiously handed over to them a piece of honeycomb and the cakes\nwrapped up in a piece of greyish paper, and began explaining\ncircumstantially all about the price and the change, but Bel\xc3\xa9tski sent\nhim away.\n\nHaving mixed honey with wine in the glasses, and having lavishly\nscattered the three pounds of spice-cakes on the table, Bel\xc3\xa9tski\ndragged the girls from their corners by force, made them sit down at\nthe table, and began distributing the cakes among them. Ol\xc3\xa9nin\ninvoluntarily noticed how Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s sunburnt but small hand closed on\ntwo round peppermint nuts and one brown one, and that she did not know\nwhat to do with them. The conversation was halting and constrained, in\nspite of \xc3\x9astenka\xe2\x80\x99s and Bel\xc3\xa9tski\xe2\x80\x99s free and easy manner and their wish\nto enliven the company. Ol\xc3\xa9nin faltered, and tried to think of\nsomething to say, feeling that he was exciting curiosity and perhaps\nprovoking ridicule and infecting the others with his shyness. He\nblushed, and it seemed to him that Mary\xc3\xa1nka in particular was feeling\nuncomfortable. \xe2\x80\x9cMost likely they are expecting us to give them some\nmoney,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he. \xe2\x80\x9cHow are we to do it? And how can we manage\nquickest to give it and get away?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXV\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is it you don\xe2\x80\x99t know your own lodger?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bel\xc3\xa9tski, addressing\nMary\xc3\xa1nka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is one to know him if he never comes to see us?\xe2\x80\x9d answered\nMary\xc3\xa1nka, with a look at Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin felt frightened, he did not know of what. He flushed and, hardly\nknowing what he was saying, remarked: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid of your mother. She\ngave me such a scolding the first time I went in.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka burst out laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you were frightened?\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\nand glanced at him and turned away.\n\nIt was the first time Ol\xc3\xa9nin had seen the whole of her beautiful face.\nTill then he had seen her with her kerchief covering her to the eyes.\nIt was not for nothing that she was reckoned the beauty of the village.\n\xc3\x9astenka was a pretty girl, small, plump, rosy, with merry brown eyes,\nand red lips which were perpetually smiling and chattering. Mary\xc3\xa1nka on\nthe contrary was certainly not pretty but beautiful. Her features might\nhave been considered too masculine and almost harsh had it not been for\nher tall stately figure, her powerful chest and shoulders, and\nespecially the severe yet tender expression of her long dark eyes which\nwere darkly shadowed beneath their black brows, and for the gentle\nexpression of her mouth and smile. She rarely smiled, but her smile was\nalways striking. She seemed to radiate virginal strength and health.\nAll the girls were good-looking, but they themselves and Bel\xc3\xa9tski, and\nthe orderly when he brought in the spice-cakes, all involuntarily gazed\nat Mary\xc3\xa1nka, and anyone addressing the girls was sure to address her.\nShe seemed a proud and happy queen among them.\n\nBel\xc3\xa9tski, trying to keep up the spirit of the party, chattered\nincessantly, made the girls hand round _chikhir_, fooled about with\nthem, and kept making improper remarks in French about Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s\nbeauty to Ol\xc3\xa9nin, calling her \xe2\x80\x9cyours\xe2\x80\x9d (_la v\xc3\xb4tre_), and advising him to\nbehave as he did himself. Ol\xc3\xa9nin felt more and more uncomfortable. He\nwas devising an excuse to get out and run away when Bel\xc3\xa9tski announced\nthat \xc3\x9astenka, whose saint\xe2\x80\x99s day it was, must offer _chikhir_ to\neverybody with a kiss. She consented on condition that they should put\nmoney on her plate, as is the custom at weddings.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat fiend brought me to this disgusting feast?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Ol\xc3\xa9nin,\nrising to go away.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you off to?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll fetch some tobacco,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, meaning to escape, but Bel\xc3\xa9tski\nseized his hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have some money,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to him in French.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne can\xe2\x80\x99t go away, one has to pay here,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Ol\xc3\xa9nin bitterly,\nvexed at his own awkwardness. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t I really behave like Bel\xc3\xa9tski? I\nought not to have come, but once I am here I must not spoil their fun.\nI must drink like a Cossack,\xe2\x80\x9d and taking the wooden bowl (holding about\neight tumblers) he almost filled it with _chikhir_ and drank it almost\nall. The girls looked at him, surprised and almost frightened, as he\ndrank. It seemed to them strange and not right. \xc3\x9astenka brought them\nanother glass each, and kissed them both. \xe2\x80\x9cThere girls, now we\xe2\x80\x99ll have\nsome fun,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, clinking on the plate the four rubles the men had\nput there.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin no longer felt awkward, but became talkative.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Mary\xc3\xa1nka, it\xe2\x80\x99s your turn to offer us wine and a kiss,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nBel\xc3\xa9tski, seizing her hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you such a kiss!\xe2\x80\x9d she said playfully, preparing to\nstrike at him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne can kiss Grandad without payment,\xe2\x80\x9d said another girl.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a sensible girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bel\xc3\xa9tski, kissing the struggling girl.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you must offer it,\xe2\x80\x9d he insisted, addressing Mary\xc3\xa1nka. \xe2\x80\x9cOffer a\nglass to your lodger.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd taking her by the hand he led her to the bench and sat her down\nbeside Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a beauty,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning her head to see it in profile.\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka did not resist but proudly smiling turned her long eyes\ntowards Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA beautiful girl,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Bel\xc3\xa9tski.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, see what a beauty I am,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s look seemed to endorse.\nWithout considering what he was doing Ol\xc3\xa9nin embraced Mary\xc3\xa1nka and was\ngoing to kiss her, but she suddenly extricated herself, upsetting\nBel\xc3\xa9tski and pushing the top off the table, and sprang away towards the\noven. There was much shouting and laughter. Then Bel\xc3\xa9tski whispered\nsomething to the girls and suddenly they all ran out into the passage\nand locked the door behind them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you kiss Bel\xc3\xa9tski and won\xe2\x80\x99t kiss me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, just so. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to, that\xe2\x80\x99s all!\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, pouting and\nfrowning. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s Grandad,\xe2\x80\x9d she added with a smile. She went to the door\nand began to bang at it. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you locked the door, you devils?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let them be there and us here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin, drawing closer to\nher.\n\nShe frowned, and sternly pushed him away with her hand. And again she\nappeared so majestically handsome to Ol\xc3\xa9nin that he came to his senses\nand felt ashamed of what he was doing. He went to the door and began\npulling at it himself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBel\xc3\xa9tski! Open the door! What a stupid joke!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka again gave a bright happy laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, you\xe2\x80\x99re afraid of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you know you\xe2\x80\x99re as cross as your mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpend more of your time with Er\xc3\xb3shka; that will make the girls love\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d And she smiled, looking straight and close into his eyes.\n\nHe did not know what to reply. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if I were to come to see you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he\nlet fall.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be a different matter,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, tossing her head.\n\nAt that moment Bel\xc3\xa9tski pushed the door open, and Mary\xc3\xa1nka sprang away\nfrom Ol\xc3\xa9nin and in doing so her thigh struck his leg.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all nonsense what I have been thinking about\xe2\x80\x94love and\nself-sacrifice and Luk\xc3\xa1shka. Happiness is the one thing. He who is\nhappy is right,\xe2\x80\x9d flashed through Ol\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s mind, and with a strength\nunexpected to himself he seized and kissed the beautiful Mary\xc3\xa1nka on\nher temple and her cheek. Mary\xc3\xa1nka was not angry, but only burst into a\nloud laugh and ran out to the other girls.\n\nThat was the end of the party. \xc3\x9astenka\xe2\x80\x99s mother, returned from her\nwork, gave all the girls a scolding, and turned them all out.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXVI\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Ol\xc3\xa9nin, as he walked home. \xe2\x80\x9cI need only slacken the\nreins a bit and I might fall desperately in love with this Cossack\ngirl.\xe2\x80\x9d He went to bed with these thoughts, but expected it all to blow\nover and that he would continue to live as before.\n\nBut the old life did not return. His relations to Mary\xc3\xa1nka were\nchanged. The wall that had separated them was broken down. Ol\xc3\xa9nin now\ngreeted her every time they met.\n\nThe master of the house having returned to collect the rent, on hearing\nof Ol\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s wealth and generosity invited him to his hut. The old woman\nreceived him kindly, and from the day of the party onwards Ol\xc3\xa9nin often\nwent in of an evening and sat with them till late at night. He seemed\nto be living in the village just as he used to, but within him\neverything had changed. He spent his days in the forest, and towards\neight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when it began to grow dusk, he would go to see his\nhosts, alone or with Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka. They grew so used to him that they\nwere surprised when he stayed away. He paid well for his wine and was a\nquiet fellow. Vany\xc3\xbasha would bring him his tea and he would sit down in\na corner near the oven. The old woman did not mind him but went on with\nher work, and over their tea or their _chikhir_ they talked about\nCossack affairs, about the neighbours, or about Russia: Ol\xc3\xa9nin relating\nand the others inquiring. Sometimes he brought a book and read to\nhimself. Mary\xc3\xa1nka crouched like a wild goat with her feet drawn up\nunder her, sometimes on the top of the oven, sometimes in a dark\ncorner. She did not take part in the conversations, but Ol\xc3\xa9nin saw her\neyes and face and heard her moving or cracking sunflower seeds, and he\nfelt that she listened with her whole being when he spoke, and was\naware of his presence while he silently read to himself. Sometimes he\nthought her eyes were fixed on him, and meeting their radiance he\ninvoluntarily became silent and gazed at her. Then she would instantly\nhide her face and he would pretend to be deep in conversation with the\nold woman, while he listened all the time to her breathing and to her\nevery movement and waited for her to look at him again. In the presence\nof others she was generally bright and friendly with him, but when they\nwere alone together she was shy and rough. Sometimes he came in before\nMary\xc3\xa1nka had returned home. Suddenly he would hear her firm footsteps\nand catch a glimmer of her blue cotton smock at the open door. Then she\nwould step into the middle of the hut, catch sight of him, and her eyes\nwould give a scarcely perceptible kindly smile, and he would feel happy\nand frightened.\n\nHe neither sought for nor wished for anything from her, but every day\nher presence became more and more necessary to him.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin had entered into the life of the Cossack village so fully that\nhis past seemed quite foreign to him. As to the future, especially a\nfuture outside the world in which he was now living, it did not\ninterest him at all. When he received letters from home, from relatives\nand friends, he was offended by the evident distress with which they\nregarded him as a lost man, while he in his village considered those as\nlost who did not live as he was living. He felt sure he would never\nrepent of having broken away from his former surroundings and of having\nsettled down in this village to such a solitary and original life. When\nout on expeditions, and when quartered at one of the forts, he felt\nhappy too; but it was here, from under Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka\xe2\x80\x99s wing, from the\nforest and from his hut at the end of the village, and especially when\nhe thought of Mary\xc3\xa1nka and Luk\xc3\xa1shka, that he seemed to see the\nfalseness of his former life. That falseness used to rouse his\nindignation even before, but now it seemed inexpressibly vile and\nridiculous. Here he felt freer and freer every day and more and more of\na man. The Caucasus now appeared entirely different to what his\nimagination had painted it. He had found nothing at all like his\ndreams, nor like the descriptions of the Caucasus he had heard and\nread. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are none of all those chestnut steeds, precipices, Amalet\nBeks, heroes or villains,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he. \xe2\x80\x9cThe people live as nature\nlives: they die, are born, unite, and more are born\xe2\x80\x94they fight, eat and\ndrink, rejoice and die, without any restrictions but those that nature\nimposes on sun and grass, on animal and tree. They have no other laws.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTherefore these people, compared to himself, appeared to him beautiful,\nstrong, and free, and the sight of them made him feel ashamed and sorry\nfor himself. Often it seriously occurred to him to throw up everything,\nto get registered as a Cossack, to buy a hut and cattle and marry a\nCossack woman (only not Mary\xc3\xa1nka, whom he conceded to Luk\xc3\xa1shka), and to\nlive with Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka and go shooting and fishing with him, and go\nwith the Cossacks on their expeditions. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy ever don\xe2\x80\x99t I do it? What\nam I waiting for?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked himself, and he egged himself on and shamed\nhimself. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I afraid of doing what I hold to be reasonable and right?\nIs the wish to be a simple Cossack, to live close to nature, not to\ninjure anyone but even to do good to others, more stupid than my former\ndreams, such as those of becoming a minister of state or a colonel?\xe2\x80\x9d\nbut a voice seemed to say that he should wait, and not take any\ndecision. He was held back by a dim consciousness that he could not\nlive altogether like Er\xc3\xb3shka and Luk\xc3\xa1shka because he had a different\nidea of happiness\xe2\x80\x94he was held back by the thought that happiness lies\nin self-sacrifice. What he had done for Luk\xc3\xa1shka continued to give him\njoy. He kept looking for occasions to sacrifice himself for others, but\ndid not meet with them. Sometimes he forgot this newly discovered\nrecipe for happiness and considered himself capable of identifying his\nlife with Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka\xe2\x80\x99s, but then he quickly bethought himself and\npromptly clutched at the idea of conscious self-sacrifice, and from\nthat basis looked calmly and proudly at all men and at their happiness.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXVII\n\n\nJust before the vintage Luk\xc3\xa1shka came on horseback to see Ol\xc3\xa9nin. He\nlooked more dashing than ever.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell? Are you getting married?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin, greeting him merrily.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka gave no direct reply.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, I\xe2\x80\x99ve exchanged your horse across the river. This _is_ a horse!\nA Kabard\xc3\xa1 horse from the Lov stud. I know horses.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey examined the new horse and made him caracole about the yard. The\nhorse really was an exceptionally fine one, a broad and long gelding,\nwith glossy coat, thick silky tail, and the soft fine mane and crest of\na thoroughbred. He was so well fed that \xe2\x80\x9cyou might go to sleep on his\nback\xe2\x80\x9d as Luk\xc3\xa1shka expressed it. His hoofs, eyes, teeth, were\nexquisitely shaped and sharply outlined, as one only finds them in very\npure-bred horses. Ol\xc3\xa9nin could not help admiring the horse, he had not\nyet met with such a beauty in the Caucasus.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how it goes!\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, patting its neck. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a step! And\nso clever\xe2\x80\x94he simply runs after his master.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you have to add much to make the exchange?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not count it,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Luk\xc3\xa1shka with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI got him from a\n_kunak_.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA wonderfully beautiful horse! What would you take for it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\nOl\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been offered a hundred and fifty rubles for it, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll give\nit you for nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, merrily. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly say the word and\nit\xe2\x80\x99s yours. I\xe2\x80\x99ll unsaddle it and you may take it. Only give me some\nsort of a horse for my duties.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, on no account.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, here is a dagger I\xe2\x80\x99ve brought you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka,\nunfastening his girdle and taking out one of the two daggers which hung\nfrom it. \xe2\x80\x9cI got it from across the river.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, thank you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd mother has promised to bring you some grapes herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s quite unnecessary. We\xe2\x80\x99ll balance up some day. You see I don\xe2\x80\x99t\noffer you any money for the dagger!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could you? We are _kunaks_. It\xe2\x80\x99s just the same as when Gir\xc3\xa9y Khan\nacross the river took me into his home and said, \xe2\x80\x98Choose what you\nlike!\xe2\x80\x99 So I took this sword. It\xe2\x80\x99s our custom.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey went into the hut and had a drink.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you staying here awhile?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have come to say good-bye. They are sending me from the cordon\nto a company beyond the T\xc3\xa9rek. I am going tonight with my comrade\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when is the wedding to be?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be coming back for the betrothal, and then I shall return to\nthe company again,\xe2\x80\x9d Luk\xc3\xa1shka replied reluctantly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, and see nothing of your betrothed?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so\xe2\x80\x94what is the good of looking at her? When you go on campaign\nask in our company for Luk\xc3\xa1shka the Broad. But what a lot of boars\nthere are in our parts! I\xe2\x80\x99ve killed two. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-bye! Christ save you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka mounted his horse, and without calling on Mary\xc3\xa1nka, rode\ncaracoling down the street, where Naz\xc3\xa1rka was already awaiting him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, shan\xe2\x80\x99t we call round?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Naz\xc3\xa1rka, winking in the direction\nof Y\xc3\xa1mka\xe2\x80\x99s house.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a good one!\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka. \xe2\x80\x9cHere, take my horse to her and if\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t come soon give him some hay. I shall reach the company by the\nmorning anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHasn\xe2\x80\x99t the cadet given you anything more?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am thankful to have paid him back with a dagger\xe2\x80\x94he was going to ask\nfor the horse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, dismounting and handing over the horse\nto Naz\xc3\xa1rka.\n\nHe darted into the yard past Ol\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s very window, and came up to the\nwindow of the cornet\xe2\x80\x99s hut. It was already quite dark. Mary\xc3\xa1nka,\nwearing only her smock, was combing her hair preparing for bed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the Cossack.\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s look was severely indifferent, but her face suddenly\nbrightened up when she heard her name. She opened the window and leant\nout, frightened and joyous.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94what do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen!\xe2\x80\x9d uttered Luk\xc3\xa1shka. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me in for a minute. I am so sick of\nwaiting! It\xe2\x80\x99s awful!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe took hold of her head through the window and kissed her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, do open!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you talk nonsense? I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you I won\xe2\x80\x99t! Have you come for\nlong?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe did not answer but went on kissing her, and she did not ask again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, through the window one can\xe2\x80\x99t even hug you properly,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary\xc3\xa1nka dear!\xe2\x80\x9d came the voice of her mother, \xe2\x80\x9cwho is that with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka took off his cap, which might have been seen, and crouched\ndown by the window.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, be quick!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Mary\xc3\xa1nka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLuk\xc3\xa1shka called round,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered; \xe2\x80\x9che was asking for Daddy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then send him here!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s gone; said he was in a hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn fact, Luk\xc3\xa1shka, stooping, as with big strides he passed under the\nwindows, ran out through the yard and towards Y\xc3\xa1mka\xe2\x80\x99s house unseen by\nanyone but Ol\xc3\xa9nin. After drinking two bowls of _chikhir_ he and Naz\xc3\xa1rka\nrode away to the outpost. The night was warm, dark, and calm. They rode\nin silence, only the footfall of their horses was heard. Luk\xc3\xa1shka\nstarted a song about the Cossack, Ming\xc3\xa1l, but stopped before he had\nfinished the first verse, and after a pause, turning to Naz\xc3\xa1rka, said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let me in!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh?\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Naz\xc3\xa1rka. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. D\xe2\x80\x99you know what Y\xc3\xa1mka\ntold me? The cadet has begun going to their house. Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka brags\nthat he got a gun from the cadet for getting him Mary\xc3\xa1nka.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe lies, the old devil!\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s not such a\ngirl. If he does not look out I\xe2\x80\x99ll wallop that old devil\xe2\x80\x99s sides,\xe2\x80\x9d and\nhe began his favourite song:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the village of Izm\xc3\xa1ylov,\nFrom the master\xe2\x80\x99s favourite garden,\nOnce escaped a keen-eyed falcon.\nSoon after him a huntsman came a-riding,\nAnd he beckoned to the falcon that had strayed,\nBut the bright-eyed bird thus answered:\n\xe2\x80\x98In gold cage you could not keep me,\nOn your hand you could not hold me,\nSo now I fly to blue seas far away.\nThere a white swan I will kill,\nOf sweet swan-flesh have my fill.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXVIII\n\n\nThe betrothal was taking place in the cornet\xe2\x80\x99s hut. Luk\xc3\xa1shka had\nreturned to the village, but had not been to see Ol\xc3\xa9nin, and Ol\xc3\xa9nin had\nnot gone to the betrothal though he had been invited. He was sad as he\nhad never been since he settled in this Cossack village. He had seen\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka earlier in the evening and was worried by the question why\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka was so cold towards him. Ol\xc3\xa9nin shut himself up in his hut and\nbegan writing in his diary as follows:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMany things have I pondered over lately and much have I changed,\xe2\x80\x9d\nwrote he, \xe2\x80\x9cand I have come back to the copybook maxim: The one way to\nbe happy is to love, to love self-denyingly, to love everybody and\neverything; to spread a web of love on all sides and to take all who\ncome into it. In this way I caught Vany\xc3\xbasha, Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka, Luk\xc3\xa1shka,\nand Mary\xc3\xa1nka.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs Ol\xc3\xa9nin was finishing this sentence Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka entered the room.\n\nEr\xc3\xb3shka was in the happiest frame of mind. A few evenings before this,\nOl\xc3\xa9nin had gone to see him and had found him with a proud and happy\nface deftly skinning the carcass of a boar with a small knife in the\nyard. The dogs (Lyam his pet among them) were lying close by watching\nwhat he was doing and gently wagging their tails. The little boys were\nrespectfully looking at him through the fence and not even teasing him\nas was their wont. His women neighbours, who were as a rule not too\ngracious towards him, greeted him and brought him, one a jug of\n_chikhir_, another some clotted cream, and a third a little flour. The\nnext day Er\xc3\xb3shka sat in his store-room all covered with blood, and\ndistributed pounds of boar-flesh, taking in payment money from some and\nwine from others. His face clearly expressed, \xe2\x80\x9cGod has sent me luck. I\nhave killed a boar, so now I am wanted.\xe2\x80\x9d Consequently, he naturally\nbegan to drink, and had gone on for four days never leaving the\nvillage. Besides which he had had something to drink at the betrothal.\n\nHe came to Ol\xc3\xa9nin quite drunk: his face red, his beard tangled, but\nwearing a new _beshmet_ trimmed with gold braid; and he brought with\nhim a _balal\xc3\xa1yka_ which he had obtained beyond the river. He had long\npromised Ol\xc3\xa9nin this treat, and felt in the mood for it, so that he was\nsorry to find Ol\xc3\xa9nin writing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWrite on, write on, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, as if he thought that a\nspirit sat between him and the paper and must not be frightened away,\nand he softly and silently sat down on the floor. When Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka\nwas drunk his favourite position was on the floor. Ol\xc3\xa9nin looked round,\nordered some wine to be brought, and continued to write. Er\xc3\xb3shka found\nit dull to drink by himself and he wished to talk.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been to the betrothal at the cornet\xe2\x80\x99s. But there! They\xe2\x80\x99re\nshwine!\xe2\x80\x94Don\xe2\x80\x99t want them!\xe2\x80\x94Have come to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where did you get your _balal\xc3\xa1yka?_\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin, still writing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been beyond the river and got it there, brother mine,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nanswered, also very quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a master at it. Tartar or Cossack,\nsquire or soldiers\xe2\x80\x99 songs, any kind you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin looked at him again, smiled, and went on writing.\n\nThat smile emboldened the old man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, leave off, my lad, leave off!\xe2\x80\x9d he said with sudden firmness.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, perhaps I will.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, people have injured you but leave them alone, spit at them!\nCome, what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of writing and writing, what\xe2\x80\x99s the good?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd he tried to mimic Ol\xc3\xa9nin by tapping the floor with his thick\nfingers, and then twisted his big face to express contempt.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good of writing quibbles. Better have a spree and show\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re a man!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNo other conception of writing found place in his head except that of\nlegal chicanery.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin burst out laughing and so did Er\xc3\xb3shka. Then, jumping up from the\nfloor, the latter began to show off his skill on the _balal\xc3\xa1yka_ and to\nsing Tartar songs.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy write, my good fellow! You\xe2\x80\x99d better listen to what I\xe2\x80\x99ll sing to\nyou. When you\xe2\x80\x99re dead you won\xe2\x80\x99t hear any more songs. Make merry now!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFirst he sang a song of his own composing accompanied by a dance:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dim,\nSay where did they last see him?\nIn a booth, at the fair,\nHe was selling pins, there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nThen he sang a song he had learnt from his former sergeant-major:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeep I fell in love on Monday,\nTuesday nothing did but sigh,\nWednesday I popped the question,\nThursday waited her reply.\nFriday, late, it came at last,\nThen all hope for me was past!\nSaturday my life to take\nI determined like a man,\nBut for my salvation\xe2\x80\x99s sake\nSunday morning changed my plan!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nThen he sang again:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dim,\nSay where did they last see him?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nAnd after that, winking, twitching his shoulders, and footing it to the\ntune, he sang:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will kiss you and embrace,\nRibbons red twine round you;\nAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ll call you little Grace.\nOh, you little Grace now do\nTell me, do you love me true?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nAnd he became so excited that with a sudden dashing movement he started\ndancing around the room accompanying himself the while.\n\nSongs like \xe2\x80\x9cDee, dee, dee\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cgentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s songs\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he sang for Ol\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s\nbenefit, but after drinking three more tumblers of _chikhir_ he\nremembered old times and began singing real Cossack and Tartar songs.\nIn the midst of one of his favourite songs his voice suddenly trembled\nand he ceased singing, and only continued strumming on the _balal\xc3\xa1yka_.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear friend!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nThe peculiar sound of his voice made Ol\xc3\xa9nin look round.\n\nThe old man was weeping. Tears stood in his eyes and one tear was\nrunning down his cheek.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are gone, my young days, and will never come back!\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\nblubbering and halting. \xe2\x80\x9cDrink, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you drink!\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly\nshouted with a deafening roar, without wiping away his tears.\n\nThere was one Tartar song that specially moved him. It had few words,\nbut its charm lay in the sad refrain. \xe2\x80\x9cAy day, dalalay!\xe2\x80\x9d Er\xc3\xb3shka\ntranslated the words of the song: \xe2\x80\x9cA youth drove his sheep from the\n_aoul_ to the mountains: the Russians came and burnt the _aoul_, they\nkilled all the men and took all the women into bondage. The youth\nreturned from the mountains. Where the _aoul_ had stood was an empty\nspace; his mother not there, nor his brothers, nor his house; one tree\nalone was left standing. The youth sat beneath the tree and wept.\n\xe2\x80\x98Alone like thee, alone am I left,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d and Er\xc3\xb3shka began singing: \xe2\x80\x9cAy\nday, dalalay!\xe2\x80\x9d and the old man repeated several times this wailing,\nheart-rending refrain.\n\nWhen he had finished the refrain Er\xc3\xb3shka suddenly seized a gun that\nhung on the wall, rushed hurriedly out into the yard and fired off both\nbarrels into the air. Then again he began, more dolefully, his \xe2\x80\x9cAy day,\ndalalay\xe2\x80\x94ah, ah,\xe2\x80\x9d and ceased.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin followed him into the porch and looked up into the starry sky in\nthe direction where the shots had flashed. In the cornet\xe2\x80\x99s house there\nwere lights and the sound of voices. In the yard girls were crowding\nround the porch and the windows, and running backwards and forwards\nbetween the hut and the outhouse. Some Cossacks rushed out of the hut\nand could not refrain from shouting, re-echoing the refrain of Daddy\nEr\xc3\xb3shka\xe2\x80\x99s song and his shots.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you not at the betrothal?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind them! Never mind them!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the old man, who had\nevidently been offended by something there. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t like them, I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\nOh, those people! Come back into the hut! Let them make merry by\nthemselves and we\xe2\x80\x99ll make merry by ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin went in.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Luk\xc3\xa1shka, is he happy? Won\xe2\x80\x99t he come to see me?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Luk\xc3\xa1shka? They\xe2\x80\x99ve lied to him and said I am getting his girl for\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what\xe2\x80\x99s the girl? She will be ours if\nwe want her. Give enough money\xe2\x80\x94and she\xe2\x80\x99s ours. I\xe2\x80\x99ll fix it up for you.\nReally!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Daddy, money can do nothing if she does not love me. You\xe2\x80\x99d better\nnot talk like that!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are not loved, you and I. We are forlorn,\xe2\x80\x9d said Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka\nsuddenly, and again he began to cry.\n\nListening to the old man\xe2\x80\x99s talk Ol\xc3\xa9nin had drunk more than usual. \xe2\x80\x9cSo\nnow my Luk\xc3\xa1shka is happy,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he; yet he felt sad. The old man had\ndrunk so much that evening that he fell down on the floor and Vany\xc3\xbasha\nhad to call soldiers in to help, and spat as they dragged the old man\nout. He was so angry with the old man for his bad behaviour that he did\nnot even say a single French word.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXIX\n\n\nIt was August. For days the sky had been cloudless, the sun scorched\nunbearably and from early morning the warm wind raised a whirl of hot\nsand from the sand-drifts and from the road, and bore it in the air\nthrough the reeds, the trees, and the village. The grass and the leaves\non the trees were covered with dust, the roads and dried-up salt\nmarshes were baked so hard that they rang when trodden on. The water\nhad long since subsided in the T\xc3\xa9rek and rapidly vanished and dried up\nin the ditches. The slimy banks of the pond near the village were\ntrodden bare by the cattle and all day long you could hear the\nsplashing of water and the shouting of girls and boys bathing. The\nsand-drifts and the reeds were already drying up in the steppes, and\nthe cattle, lowing, ran into the fields in the day-time. The boars\nmigrated into the distant reed-beds and to the hills beyond the T\xc3\xa9rek.\nMosquitoes and gnats swarmed in thick clouds over the low lands and\nvillages. The snow-peaks were hidden in grey mist. The air was rarefied\nand smoky. It was said that _abreks_ had crossed the now shallow river\nand were prowling on this side of it. Every night the sun set in a\nglowing red blaze. It was the busiest time of the year. The villagers\nall swarmed in the melon-fields and the vineyards. The vineyards\nthickly overgrown with twining verdure lay in cool, deep shade.\nEverywhere between the broad translucent leaves, ripe, heavy, black\nclusters peeped out. Along the dusty road from the vineyards the\ncreaking carts moved slowly, heaped up with black grapes. Clusters of\nthem, crushed by the wheels, lay in the dirt. Boys and girls in smocks\nstained with grape-juice, with grapes in their hands and mouths, ran\nafter their mothers. On the road you continually came across tattered\nlabourers with baskets of grapes on their powerful shoulders; Cossack\nmaidens, veiled with kerchiefs to their eyes, drove bullocks harnessed\nto carts laden high with grapes. Soldiers who happened to meet these\ncarts asked for grapes, and the maidens, clambering up without stopping\ntheir carts, would take an armful of grapes and drop them into the\nskirts of the soldiers\xe2\x80\x99 coats. In some homesteads they had already\nbegun pressing the grapes; and the smell of the emptied skins filled\nthe air. One saw the blood-red troughs in the pent-houses in the yards\nand Nog\xc3\xa1y labourers with their trousers rolled up and their legs\nstained with the juice. Grunting pigs gorged themselves with the empty\nskins and rolled about in them. The flat roofs of the outhouses were\nall spread over with the dark amber clusters drying in the sun. Daws\nand magpies crowded round the roofs, picking the seeds and fluttering\nfrom one place to another.\n\nThe fruits of the year\xe2\x80\x99s labour were being merrily gathered in, and\nthis year the fruit was unusually fine and plentiful.\n\nIn the shady green vineyards amid a sea of vines, laughter, songs,\nmerriment, and the voices of women were to be heard on all sides, and\nglimpses of their bright-coloured garments could be seen.\n\nJust at noon Mary\xc3\xa1nka was sitting in their vineyard in the shade of a\npeach-tree, getting out the family dinner from under an unharnessed\ncart. Opposite her, on a spread-out horse-cloth, sat the cornet (who\nhad returned from the school) washing his hands by pouring water on\nthem from a little jug. Her little brother, who had just come straight\nout of the pond, stood wiping his face with his wide sleeves, and gazed\nanxiously at his sister and his mother and breathed deeply, awaiting\nhis dinner. The old mother, with her sleeves rolled up over her strong\nsunburnt arms, was arranging grapes, dried fish, and clotted cream on a\nlittle low, circular Tartar table. The cornet wiped his hands, took off\nhis cap, crossed himself, and moved nearer to the table. The boy seized\nthe jug and eagerly began to drink. The mother and daughter crossed\ntheir legs under them and sat down by the table. Even in the shade it\nwas intolerably hot. The air above the vineyard smelt unpleasant: the\nstrong warm wind passing amid the branches brought no coolness, but\nonly monotonously bent the tops of the pear, peach, and mulberry trees\nwith which the vineyard was sprinkled. The cornet, having crossed\nhimself once more, took a little jug of _chikhir_ that stood behind him\ncovered with a vine-leaf, and having had a drink from the mouth of the\njug passed it to the old woman. He had nothing on over his shirt, which\nwas unfastened at the neck and showed his shaggy muscular chest. His\nfine-featured cunning face looked cheerful; neither in his attitude nor\nin his words was his usual wiliness to be seen; he was cheerful and\nnatural.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we finish the bit beyond the shed tonight?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, wiping his\nwet beard.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll manage it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied his wife, \xe2\x80\x9cif only the weather does not\nhinder us. The D\xc3\xabmkins have not half finished yet,\xe2\x80\x9d she added. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly\n\xc3\x9astenka is at work there, wearing herself out.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you expect of them?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man proudly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, have a drink, Mary\xc3\xa1nka dear!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman, passing the\njug to the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cGod willing we\xe2\x80\x99ll have enough to pay for the wedding\nfeast,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not yet awhile,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cornet with a slight frown.\n\nThe girl hung her head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we mention it?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman. \xe2\x80\x9cThe affair is\nsettled, and the time is drawing near too.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t make plans beforehand,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cornet. \xe2\x80\x9cNow we have the\nharvest to get in.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen Luk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s new horse?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the old woman. \xe2\x80\x9cThat which\nDm\xc3\xadtri Andr\xc3\xa9ich Ol\xc3\xa9nin gave him is gone \xe2\x80\x94 he\xe2\x80\x99s exchanged it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have not; but I spoke with the servant today,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cornet,\n\xe2\x80\x9cand he said his master has again received a thousand rubles.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRolling in riches, in short,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman.\n\nThe whole family felt cheerful and contented.\n\nThe work was progressing successfully. The grapes were more abundant\nand finer than they had expected. After dinner Mary\xc3\xa1nka threw some\ngrass to the oxen, folded her _beshmet_ for a pillow, and lay down\nunder the wagon on the juicy down-trodden grass. She had on only a red\nkerchief over her head and a faded blue print smock, yet she felt\nunbearably hot. Her face was burning, and she did not know where to put\nher feet, her eyes were moist with sleepiness and weariness, her lips\nparted involuntarily, and her chest heaved heavily and deeply.\n\nThe busy time of year had begun a fortnight ago and the continuous\nheavy labour had filled the girl\xe2\x80\x99s life. At dawn she jumped up, washed\nher face with cold water, wrapped herself in a shawl, and ran out\nbarefoot to see to the cattle. Then she hurriedly put on her shoes and\nher _beshmet_ and, taking a small bundle of bread, she harnessed the\nbullocks and drove away to the vineyards for the whole day. There she\ncut the grapes and carried the baskets with only an hour\xe2\x80\x99s interval for\nrest, and in the evening she returned to the village, bright and not\ntired, dragging the bullocks by a rope or driving them with a long\nstick. After attending to the cattle, she took some sunflower seeds in\nthe wide sleeve of her smock and went to the corner of the street to\ncrack them and have some fun with the other girls. But as soon as it\nwas dusk she returned home, and after having supper with her parents\nand her brother in the dark outhouse, she went into the hut, healthy\nand free from care, and climbed onto the oven, where half drowsing she\nlistened to their lodger\xe2\x80\x99s conversation. As soon as he went away she\nwould throw herself down on her bed and sleep soundly and quietly till\nmorning. And so it went on day after day. She had not seen Luk\xc3\xa1shka\nsince the day of their betrothal, but calmly awaited the wedding. She\nhad got used to their lodger and felt his intent looks with pleasure.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXX\n\n\nAlthough there was no escape from the heat and the mosquitoes swarmed\nin the cool shadow of the wagons, and her little brother tossing about\nbeside her kept pushing her, Mary\xc3\xa1nka having drawn her kerchief over\nher head was just falling asleep, when suddenly their neighbour \xc3\x9astenka\ncame running towards her and, diving under the wagon, lay down beside\nher.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSleep, girls, sleep!\xe2\x80\x9d said \xc3\x9astenka, making herself comfortable under\nthe wagon. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cthis won\xe2\x80\x99t do!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe jumped up, plucked some green branches, and stuck them through the\nwheels on both sides of the wagon and hung her _beshmet_ over them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me in,\xe2\x80\x9d she shouted to the little boy as she again crept under the\nwagon. \xe2\x80\x9cIs this the place for a Cossack\xe2\x80\x94with the girls? Go away!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen alone under the wagon with her friend, \xc3\x9astenka suddenly put both\nher arms round her, and clinging close to her began kissing her cheeks\nand neck.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDarling, sweetheart,\xe2\x80\x9d she kept repeating, between bursts of shrill,\nclear laughter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you\xe2\x80\x99ve learnt it from Grandad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary\xc3\xa1nka, struggling. \xe2\x80\x9cStop\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd they both broke into such peals of laughter that Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s mother\nshouted to them to be quiet.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you jealous?\xe2\x80\x9d asked \xc3\x9astenka in a whisper.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat humbug! Let me sleep. What have you come for?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut \xc3\x9astenka kept on, \xe2\x80\x9cI say! But I wanted to tell you such a thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka raised herself on her elbow and arranged the kerchief which\nhad slipped off.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know something about your lodger!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary\xc3\xa1nka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you rogue of a girl!\xe2\x80\x9d said \xc3\x9astenka, nudging her with her elbow and\nlaughing. \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t tell anything. Does he come to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe does. What of that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary\xc3\xa1nka with a sudden blush.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I\xe2\x80\x99m a simple lass. I tell everybody. Why should I pretend?\xe2\x80\x9d said\n\xc3\x9astenka, and her bright rosy face suddenly became pensive. \xe2\x80\x9cWhom do I\nhurt? I love him, that\xe2\x80\x99s all about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrandad, do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the sin?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Mary\xc3\xa1nka! When is one to have a good time if not while one\xe2\x80\x99s still\nfree? When I marry a Cossack I shall bear children and shall have\ncares. There now, when you get married to Luk\xc3\xa1shka not even a thought\nof joy will enter your head: children will come, and work!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell? Some who are married live happily. It makes no difference!\xe2\x80\x9d\nMary\xc3\xa1nka replied quietly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo tell me just this once what has passed between you and Luk\xc3\xa1shka?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has passed? A match was proposed. Father put it off for a year,\nbut now it\xe2\x80\x99s been settled and they\xe2\x80\x99ll marry us in autumn.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what did he say to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka smiled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat should he say? He said he loved me. He kept asking me to come to\nthe vineyards with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust see what pitch! But you didn\xe2\x80\x99t go, did you? And what a dare-devil\nhe has become: the first among the braves. He makes merry out there in\nthe army too! The other day our K\xc3\xadrka came home; he says: \xe2\x80\x98What a horse\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s got in exchange!\xe2\x80\x99 But all the same I expect he frets after\nyou. And what else did he say?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust you know everything?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary\xc3\xa1nka laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cOne night he came\nto my window tipsy, and asked me to let him in.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you didn\xe2\x80\x99t let him?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him, indeed! Once I have said a thing I keep to it firm as a\nrock,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mary\xc3\xa1nka seriously.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fine fellow! If he wanted her, no girl would refuse him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let him go to the others,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mary\xc3\xa1nka proudly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t pity him?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do pity him, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll have no nonsense. It is wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xc3\x9astenka suddenly dropped her head on her friend\xe2\x80\x99s breast, seized hold\nof her, and shook with smothered laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cYou silly fool!\xe2\x80\x9d she\nexclaimed, quite out of breath. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be happy,\xe2\x80\x9d and she\nbegan tickling Mary\xc3\xa1nka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, leave off!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary\xc3\xa1nka, screaming and laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve crushed\nLaz\xc3\xbatka.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHark at those young devils! Quite frisky! Not tired yet!\xe2\x80\x9d came the old\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s sleepy voice from the wagon.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t want happiness,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated \xc3\x9astenka in a whisper, insistently.\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are lucky, that you are! How they love you! You are so crusty,\nand yet they love you. Ah, if I were in your place I\xe2\x80\x99d soon turn the\nlodger\xe2\x80\x99s head! I noticed him when you were at our house. He was ready\nto eat you with his eyes. What things Grandad has given me! And yours\nthey say is the richest of the Russians. His orderly says they have\nserfs of their own.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka raised herself, and after thinking a moment, smiled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what he once told me: the lodger I mean?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, biting\na bit of grass. \xe2\x80\x9cHe said, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99d like to be Luk\xc3\xa1shka the Cossack, or your\nbrother Laz\xc3\xbatka\xe2\x80\x94.\xe2\x80\x99 What do you think he meant?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, just chattering what came into his head,\xe2\x80\x9d answered \xc3\x9astenka. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\ndoes mine not say! Just as if he was possessed!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka dropped her hand on her folded _beshmet_, threw her arm over\n\xc3\x9astenka\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, and shut her eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wanted to come and work in the vineyard today: father invited him,\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe said, and after a short silence she fell asleep.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXXI\n\n\nThe sun had come out from behind the pear-tree that had shaded the\nwagon, and even through the branches that \xc3\x9astenka had fixed up it\nscorched the faces of the sleeping girls. Mary\xc3\xa1nka woke up and began\narranging the kerchief on her head. Looking about her, beyond the\npear-tree she noticed their lodger, who with his gun on his shoulder\nstood talking to her father. She nudged \xc3\x9astenka and smilingly pointed\nhim out to her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went yesterday and didn\xe2\x80\x99t find a single one,\xe2\x80\x9d Ol\xc3\xa9nin was saying as\nhe looked about uneasily, not seeing Mary\xc3\xa1nka through the branches.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you should go out there in that direction, go right as by\ncompasses, there in a disused vineyard denominated as the Waste, hares\nare always to be found,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cornet, having at once changed his\nmanner of speech.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fine thing to go looking for hares in these busy times! You had\nbetter come and help us, and do some work with the girls,\xe2\x80\x9d the old\nwoman said merrily. \xe2\x80\x9cNow then, girls, up with you!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka and \xc3\x9astenka under the cart were whispering and could hardly\nrestrain their laughter.\n\nSince it had become known that Ol\xc3\xa9nin had given a horse worth fifty\nrubles to Luk\xc3\xa1shka, his hosts had become more amiable and the cornet in\nparticular saw with pleasure his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s growing intimacy with\nOl\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to do the work,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ol\xc3\xa9nin, trying not to\nlook through the green branches under the wagon where he had now\nnoticed Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s blue smock and red kerchief.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you some peaches,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only according to the ancient Cossack hospitality. It\xe2\x80\x99s her old\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s silliness,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cornet, explaining and apparently\ncorrecting his wife\xe2\x80\x99s words. \xe2\x80\x9cIn Russia, I expect, it\xe2\x80\x99s not so much\npeaches as pineapple jam and preserves you have been accustomed to eat\nat your pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you say hares are to be found in the disused vineyard?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\nOl\xc3\xa9nin. \xe2\x80\x9cI will go there,\xe2\x80\x9d and throwing a hasty glance through the\ngreen branches he raised his cap and disappeared between the regular\nrows of green vines.\n\nThe sun had already sunk behind the fence of the vineyards, and its\nbroken rays glittered through the translucent leaves when Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nreturned to his host\xe2\x80\x99s vineyard. The wind was falling and a cool\nfreshness was beginning to spread around. By some instinct Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nrecognized from afar Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s blue smock among the rows of vine, and,\npicking grapes on his way, he approached her. His highly excited dog\nalso now and then seized a low-hanging cluster of grapes in his\nslobbering mouth. Mary\xc3\xa1nka, her face flushed, her sleeves rolled up,\nand her kerchief down below her chin, was rapidly cutting the heavy\nclusters and laying them in a basket. Without letting go of the vine\nshe had hold of, she stopped to smile pleasantly at him and resumed her\nwork. Ol\xc3\xa9nin drew near and threw his gun behind his back to have his\nhands free. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are your people? May God aid you! Are you alone?\xe2\x80\x9d he\nmeant to say but did not say, and only raised his cap in silence.\n\nHe was ill at ease alone with Mary\xc3\xa1nka, but as if purposely to torment\nhimself he went up to her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be shooting the women with your gun like that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary\xc3\xa1nka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I shan\xe2\x80\x99t shoot them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey were both silent.\n\nThen after a pause she said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou should help me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe took out his knife and began silently to cut off the clusters. He\nreached from under the leaves low down a thick bunch weighing about\nthree pounds, the grapes of which grew so close that they flattened\neach other for want of space. He showed it to Mary\xc3\xa1nka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust they all be cut? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t this one too green?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTheir hands touched. Ol\xc3\xa9nin took her hand, and she looked at him\nsmiling.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to be married soon?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\nShe did not answer, but turned away with a stern look.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you love Luk\xc3\xa1shka?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI envy him!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery likely!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo really. You are so beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd he suddenly felt terribly ashamed of having said it, so commonplace\ndid the words seem to him. He flushed, lost control of himself, and\nseized both her hands.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever I am, I\xe2\x80\x99m not for you. Why do you make fun of me?\xe2\x80\x9d replied\nMary\xc3\xa1nka, but her look showed how certainly she knew he was not making\nfun.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaking fun? If you only knew how I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe words sounded still more commonplace, they accorded still less with\nwhat he felt, but yet he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I would not do\nfor you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave me alone, you pitch!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut her face, her shining eyes, her swelling bosom, her shapely legs,\nsaid something quite different. It seemed to him that she understood\nhow petty were all things he had said, but that she was superior to\nsuch considerations. It seemed to him she had long known all he wished\nand was not able to tell her, but wanted to hear how he would say it.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how can she help knowing,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9csince I only want to tell\nher all that she herself is? But she does not wish to understand, does\nnot wish to reply.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo!\xe2\x80\x9d suddenly came \xc3\x9astenka\xe2\x80\x99s high voice from behind the vine at no\ngreat distance, followed by her shrill laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cCome and help me, Dm\xc3\xadtri\nAndr\xc3\xa9ich. I am all alone,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, thrusting her round, na\xc3\xafve little\nface through the vines.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin did not answer nor move from his place.\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka went on cutting and continually looked up at Ol\xc3\xa9nin. He was\nabout to say something, but stopped, shrugged his shoulders and, having\njerked up his gun, walked out of the vineyard with rapid strides.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXXII\n\n\nHe stopped once or twice, listening to the ringing laughter of Mary\xc3\xa1nka\nand \xc3\x9astenka who, having come together, were shouting something. Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nspent the whole evening hunting in the forest and returned home at dusk\nwithout having killed anything. When crossing the road he noticed her\nopen the door of the outhouse, and her blue smock showed through it. He\ncalled to Vany\xc3\xbasha very loud so as to let her know that he was back,\nand then sat down in the porch in his usual place. His hosts now\nreturned from the vineyard; they came out of the outhouse and into\ntheir hut, but did not ask him in. Mary\xc3\xa1nka went twice out of the gate.\nOnce in the twilight it seemed to him that she was looking at him. He\neagerly followed her every movement, but could not make up his mind to\napproach her. When she disappeared into the hut he left the porch and\nbegan pacing up and down the yard, but Mary\xc3\xa1nka did not come out again.\nOl\xc3\xa9nin spent the whole sleepless night out in the yard listening to\nevery sound in his hosts\xe2\x80\x99 hut. He heard them talking early in the\nevening, heard them having their supper and pulling out their cushions,\nand going to bed; he heard Mary\xc3\xa1nka laughing at something, and then\nheard everything growing gradually quiet.\n\nThe cornet and his wife talked a while in whispers, and someone was\nbreathing. Ol\xc3\xa9nin re-entered his hut. Vany\xc3\xbasha lay asleep in his\nclothes. Ol\xc3\xa9nin envied him, and again went out to pace the yard, always\nexpecting something, but no one came, no one moved, and he only heard\nthe regular breathing of three people. He knew Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s breathing and\nlistened to it and to the beating of his own heart. In the village\neverything was quiet. The waning moon rose late, and the deep-breathing\ncattle in the yard became more visible as they lay down and slowly\nrose. Ol\xc3\xa9nin angrily asked himself, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it I want?\xe2\x80\x9d but could not\ntear himself away from the enchantment of the night. Suddenly he\nthought he distinctly heard the floor creak and the sound of footsteps\nin his hosts\xe2\x80\x99 hut. He rushed to the door, but all was silent again\nexcept for the sound of regular breathing, and in the yard the\nbuffalo-cow, after a deep sigh, again moved, rose on her foreknees and\nthen on her feet, swished her tail, and something splashed steadily on\nthe dry clay ground; then she lay down again in the dim moonlight. He\nasked himself: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I to do?\xe2\x80\x9d and definitely decided to go to bed,\nbut again he heard a sound, and in his imagination there arose the\nimage of Mary\xc3\xa1nka coming out into this moonlit misty night, and again\nhe rushed to her window and again heard the sound of footsteps. Not\ntill just before dawn did he go up to her window and push at the\nshutter and then run to the door, and this time he really heard\nMary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s deep breathing and her footsteps. He took hold of the latch\nand knocked. The floor hardly creaked under the bare cautious footsteps\nwhich approached the door. The latch clicked, the door creaked, and he\nnoticed a faint smell of marjoram and pumpkin, and Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s whole\nfigure appeared in the doorway. He saw her only for an instant in the\nmoonlight. She slammed the door and, muttering something, ran lightly\nback again. Ol\xc3\xa9nin began rapping softly but nothing responded. He ran\nto the window and listened. Suddenly he was startled by a shrill,\nsqueaky man\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed a rather small young Cossack in a white cap, coming\nacross the yard close to Ol\xc3\xa9nin. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw ... fine!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin recognized Naz\xc3\xa1rka, and was silent, not knowing what to do or\nsay.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine! I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and tell them at the office, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell her father!\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s a fine cornet\xe2\x80\x99s daughter! One\xe2\x80\x99s not enough for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want of me, what are you after?\xe2\x80\x9d uttered Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing; only I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell them at the office.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka spoke very loud, and evidently did so intentionally, adding:\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust see what a clever cadet!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin trembled and grew pale.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here, here!\xe2\x80\x9d He seized the Cossack firmly by the arm and drew him\ntowards his hut.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing happened, she did not let me in, and I too mean no harm. She\nis an honest girl\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, discuss\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but all the same I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you something now. Wait a bit!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka said nothing. Ol\xc3\xa9nin ran into his hut and brought out ten\nrubles, which he gave to the Cossack.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing happened, but still I was to blame, so I give this!\xe2\x80\x94Only for\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s sake don\xe2\x80\x99t let anyone know, for nothing happened...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you joy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Naz\xc3\xa1rka laughing, and went away.\n\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka had come to the village that night at Luk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s bidding to\nfind a place to hide a stolen horse, and now, passing by on his way\nhome, had heard the sound of footsteps. When he returned next morning\nto his company he bragged to his chum, and told him how cleverly he had\ngot ten rubles. Next morning Ol\xc3\xa9nin met his hosts and they knew nothing\nabout the events of the night. He did not speak to Mary\xc3\xa1nka, and she\nonly laughed a little when she looked at him. Next night he also passed\nwithout sleep, vainly wandering about the yard. The day after he\npurposely spent shooting, and in the evening he went to see Bel\xc3\xa9tski to\nescape from his own thoughts. He was afraid of himself, and promised\nhimself not to go to his hosts\xe2\x80\x99 hut any more.\n\nThat night he was roused by the sergeant-major. His company was ordered\nto start at once on a raid. Ol\xc3\xa9nin was glad this had happened, and\nthought he would not again return to the village.\n\nThe raid lasted four days. The commander, who was a relative of\nOl\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s, wished to see him and offered to let him remain with the\nstaff, but this Ol\xc3\xa9nin declined. He found that he could not live away\nfrom the village, and asked to be allowed to return to it. For having\ntaken part in the raid he received a soldier\xe2\x80\x99s cross, which he had\nformerly greatly desired. Now he was quite indifferent about it, and\neven more indifferent about his promotion, the order for which had\nstill not arrived. Accompanied by Vany\xc3\xbasha he rode back to the cordon\nwithout any accident several hours in advance of the rest of the\ncompany. He spent the whole evening in his porch watching Mary\xc3\xa1nka, and\nhe again walked about the yard, without aim or thought, all night.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXXIII\n\n\nIt was late when he awoke the next day. His hosts were no longer in. He\ndid not go shooting, but now took up a book, and now went out into the\nporch, and now again re-entered the hut and lay down on the bed.\nVany\xc3\xbasha thought he was ill.\n\nTowards evening Ol\xc3\xa9nin got up, resolutely began writing, and wrote on\ntill late at night. He wrote a letter, but did not post it because he\nfelt that no one would have understood what he wanted to say, and\nbesides it was not necessary that anyone but himself should understand\nit.\n\nThis is what he wrote:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI receive letters of condolence from Russia. They are afraid that I\nshall perish, buried in these wilds. They say about me: \xe2\x80\x98He will become\ncoarse; he will be behind the times in everything; he will take to\ndrink, and who knows but that he may marry a Cossack girl.\xe2\x80\x99 It was not\nfor nothing, they say, that Erm\xc3\xb3lov declared: \xe2\x80\x98Anyone serving in the\nCaucasus for ten years either becomes a confirmed drunkard or marries a\nloose woman.\xe2\x80\x99 How terrible! Indeed it won\xe2\x80\x99t do for me to ruin myself\nwhen I might have the great happiness of even becoming the Countess\nB\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99s husband, or a Court chamberlain, or a _Mar\xc3\xa9chal de noblesse_ of\nmy district. Oh, how repulsive and pitiable you all seem to me! You do\nnot know what happiness is and what life is! One must taste life once\nin all its natural beauty, must see and understand what I see every day\nbefore me\xe2\x80\x94those eternally unapproachable snowy peaks, and a majestic\nwoman in that primitive beauty in which the first woman must have come\nfrom her creator\xe2\x80\x99s hands\xe2\x80\x94and then it becomes clear who is ruining\nhimself and who is living truly or falsely\xe2\x80\x94you or I. If you only knew\nhow despicable and pitiable you, in your delusions, seem to me! When I\npicture to myself\xe2\x80\x94in place of my hut, my forests, and my love\xe2\x80\x94those\ndrawing-rooms, those women with their pomatum-greased hair eked out\nwith false curls, those unnaturally grimacing lips, those hidden,\nfeeble, distorted limbs, and that chatter of obligatory drawing-room\nconversation which has no right to the name\xe2\x80\x94I feel unendurably\nrevolted. I then see before me those obtuse faces, those rich eligible\ngirls whose looks seem to say: \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s all right, you may come near\nthough I am rich and eligible\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94and that arranging and rearranging of\nseats, that shameless match-making and that eternal tittle-tattle and\npretence; those rules\xe2\x80\x94with whom to shake hands, to whom only to nod,\nwith whom to converse (and all this done deliberately with a conviction\nof its inevitability), that continual ennui in the blood passing on\nfrom generation to generation. Try to understand or believe just this\none thing: you need only see and comprehend what truth and beauty are,\nand all that you now say and think and all your wishes for me and for\nyourselves will fly to atoms!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHappiness is being with nature, seeing her, and conversing with her.\n\xe2\x80\x98He may even (God forbid) marry a common Cossack girl, and be quite\nlost socially\xe2\x80\x99 I can imagine them saying of me with sincere pity! Yet\nthe one thing I desire is to be quite \xe2\x80\x98lost\xe2\x80\x99 in your sense of the word.\nI wish to marry a Cossack girl, and dare not because it would be a\nheight of happiness of which I am unworthy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree months have passed since I first saw the Cossack girl, Mary\xc3\xa1nka.\nThe views and prejudices of the world I had left were still fresh in\nme. I did not then believe that I could love that woman. I delighted in\nher beauty just as I delighted in the beauty of the mountains and the\nsky, nor could I help delighting in her, for she is as beautiful as\nthey. I found that the sight of her beauty had become a necessity of my\nlife and I began asking myself whether I did not love her. But I could\nfind nothing within myself at all like love as I had imagined it to be.\nMine was not the restlessness of loneliness and desire for marriage,\nnor was it platonic, still less a carnal love such as I have\nexperienced. I needed only to see her, to hear her, to know that she\nwas near\xe2\x80\x94and if I was not happy, I was at peace.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter an evening gathering at which I met her and touched her, I felt\nthat between that woman and myself there existed an indissoluble though\nunacknowledged bond against which I could not struggle, yet I did\nstruggle. I asked myself: \xe2\x80\x98Is it possible to love a woman who will\nnever understand the profoundest interests of my life? Is it possible\nto love a woman simply for her beauty, to love the statue of a woman?\xe2\x80\x99\nBut I was already in love with her, though I did not yet trust to my\nfeelings.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter that evening when I first spoke to her our relations changed.\nBefore that she had been to me an extraneous but majestic object of\nexternal nature: but since then she has become a human being. I began\nto meet her, to talk to her, and sometimes to go to work for her father\nand to spend whole evenings with them, and in this intimate intercourse\nshe remained still in my eyes just as pure, inaccessible, and majestic.\nShe always responded with equal calm, pride, and cheerful equanimity.\nSometimes she was friendly, but generally her every look, every word,\nand every movement expressed equanimity\xe2\x80\x94not contemptuous, but crushing\nand bewitching. Every day with a feigned smile on my lips I tried to\nplay a part, and with torments of passion and desire in my heart I\nspoke banteringly to her. She saw that I was dissembling, but looked\nstraight at me cheerfully and simply. This position became unbearable.\nI wished not to deceive her but to tell her all I thought and felt. I\nwas extremely agitated. We were in the vineyard when I began to tell\nher of my love, in words I am now ashamed to remember. I am ashamed\nbecause I ought not to have dared to speak so to her because she stood\nfar above such words and above the feeling they were meant to express.\nI said no more, but from that day my position has been intolerable. I\ndid not wish to demean myself by continuing our former flippant\nrelations, and at the same time I felt that I had not yet reached the\nlevel of straight and simple relations with her. I asked myself\ndespairingly, \xe2\x80\x98What am I to do?\xe2\x80\x99 In foolish dreams I imagined her now\nas my mistress and now as my wife, but rejected both ideas with\ndisgust. To make her a wanton woman would be dreadful. It would be\nmurder. To turn her into a fine lady, the wife of Dm\xc3\xadtri Andr\xc3\xa9ich\nOl\xc3\xa9nin, like a Cossack woman here who is married to one of our\nofficers, would be still worse. Now could I turn Cossack like Luk\xc3\xa1shka,\nand steal horses, get drunk on _chikhir_, sing rollicking songs, kill\npeople, and when drunk climb in at her window for the night without a\nthought of who and what I am, it would be different: then we might\nunderstand one another and I might be happy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tried to throw myself into that kind of life but was still more\nconscious of my own weakness and artificiality. I cannot forget myself\nand my complex, distorted past, and my future appears to me still more\nhopeless. Every day I have before me the distant snowy mountains and\nthis majestic, happy woman. But not for me is the only happiness\npossible in the world; I cannot have this woman! What is most terrible\nand yet sweetest in my condition is that I feel that I understand her\nbut that she will never understand me; not because she is inferior: on\nthe contrary she ought not to understand me. She is happy, she is like\nnature: consistent, calm, and self-contained; and I, a weak distorted\nbeing, want her to understand my deformity and my torments! I have not\nslept at night, but have aimlessly passed under her windows not\nrendering account to myself of what was happening to me. On the 18th\nour company started on a raid, and I spent three days away from the\nvillage. I was sad and apathetic, the usual songs, cards,\ndrinking-bouts, and talk of rewards in the regiment, were more\nrepulsive to me than usual. Yesterday I returned home and saw her, my\nhut. Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka, and the snowy mountains, from my porch, and was\nseized by such a strong, new feeling of joy that I understood it all. I\nlove this woman; I feel real love for the first and only time in my\nlife. I know what has befallen me. I do not fear to be degraded by this\nfeeling, I am not ashamed of my love, I am proud of it. It is not my\nfault that I love. It has come about against my will. I tried to escape\nfrom my love by self-renunciation, and tried to devise a joy in the\nCossack Luk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s and Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s love, but thereby only stirred up my\nown love and jealousy. This is not the ideal, the so-called exalted\nlove which I have known before; not that sort of attachment in which\nyou admire your own love and feel that the source of your emotion is\nwithin yourself and do everything yourself. I have felt that too. It is\nstill less a desire for enjoyment: it is something different. Perhaps\nin her I love nature: the personification of all that is beautiful in\nnature; but yet I am not acting by my own will, but some elemental\nforce loves through me; the whole of God\xe2\x80\x99s world, all nature, presses\nthis love into my soul and says, \xe2\x80\x98Love her.\xe2\x80\x99 I love her not with my\nmind or my imagination, but with my whole being. Loving her I feel\nmyself to be an integral part of all God\xe2\x80\x99s joyous world. I wrote before\nabout the new convictions to which my solitary life had brought me, but\nno one knows with what labour they shaped themselves within me and with\nwhat joy I realized them and saw a new way of life opening out before\nme; nothing was dearer to me than those convictions... Well! ... love\nhas come and neither they nor any regrets for them remain! It is even\ndifficult for me to believe that I could prize such a one-sided, cold,\nand abstract state of mind. Beauty came and scattered to the winds all\nthat laborious inward toil, and no regret remains for what has\nvanished! Self-renunciation is all nonsense and absurdity! That is\npride, a refuge from well-merited unhappiness, and salvation from the\nenvy of others\xe2\x80\x99 happiness: \xe2\x80\x98Live for others, and do good!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94Why? when in\nmy soul there is only love for myself and the desire to love her and to\nlive her life with her? Not for others, not for Luk\xc3\xa1shka, I now desire\nhappiness. I do not now love those others. Formerly I should have told\nmyself that this is wrong. I should have tormented myself with the\nquestions: What will become of her, of me, and of Luk\xc3\xa1shka? Now I don\xe2\x80\x99t\ncare. I do not live my own life, there is something stronger than me\nwhich directs me. I suffer; but formerly I was dead and only now do I\nlive. Today I will go to their house and tell her everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXXIV\n\n\nLate that evening, after writing this letter, Ol\xc3\xa9nin went to his hosts\xe2\x80\x99\nhut. The old woman was sitting on a bench behind the oven unwinding\ncocoons. Mary\xc3\xa1nka with her head uncovered sat sewing by the light of a\ncandle. On seeing Ol\xc3\xa9nin she jumped up, took her kerchief and stepped\nto the oven.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary\xc3\xa1nka dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said her mother, \xe2\x80\x9cwon\xe2\x80\x99t you sit here with me a bit?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m bareheaded,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, and sprang up on the oven.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin could only see a knee, and one of her shapely legs hanging down\nfrom the oven. He treated the old woman to tea. She treated her guest\nto clotted cream which she sent Mary\xc3\xa1nka to fetch. But having put a\nplateful on the table Mary\xc3\xa1nka again sprang on the oven from whence\nOl\xc3\xa9nin felt her eyes upon him. They talked about household matters.\nGranny Ul\xc3\xadtka became animated and went into raptures of hospitality.\nShe brought Ol\xc3\xa9nin preserved grapes and a grape tart and some of her\nbest wine, and pressed him to eat and drink with the rough yet proud\nhospitality of country folk, only found among those who produce their\nbread by the labour of their own hands.\n\nThe old woman, who had at first struck Ol\xc3\xa9nin so much by her rudeness,\nnow often touched him by her simple tenderness towards her daughter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we need not offend the Lord by grumbling! We have enough of\neverything, thank God. We have pressed sufficient _chikhir_ and have\npreserved and shall sell three or four barrels of grapes and have\nenough left to drink. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be in a hurry to leave us. We will make\nmerry together at the wedding.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when is the wedding to be?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin, feeling his blood\nsuddenly rush to his face while his heart beat irregularly and\npainfully.\n\nHe heard a movement on the oven and the sound of seeds being cracked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know, it ought to be next week. We are quite ready,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\nthe old woman, as simply and quietly as though Ol\xc3\xa9nin did not exist. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nhave prepared and have procured everything for Mary\xc3\xa1nka. We will give\nher away properly. Only there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing not quite right. Our Luk\xc3\xa1shka\nhas been running rather wild. He has been too much on the spree! He\xe2\x80\x99s\nup to tricks! The other day a Cossack came here from his company and\nsaid he had been to Nog\xc3\xa1y.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must mind he does not get caught,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I tell him. \xe2\x80\x98Mind, Luk\xc3\xa1shka, don\xe2\x80\x99t you get into\nmischief. Well, of course, a young fellow naturally wants to cut a\ndash. But there\xe2\x80\x99s a time for everything. Well, you\xe2\x80\x99ve captured or\nstolen something and killed an _abrek!_ Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re a fine fellow! But\nnow you should live quietly for a bit, or else there\xe2\x80\x99ll be trouble.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I saw him a time or two in the division, he was always\nmerry-making. He has sold another horse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin, and glanced\ntowards the oven. A pair of large, dark, and hostile eyes glittered as\nthey gazed severely at him.\n\nHe became ashamed of what he had said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat of it? He does no one any\nharm,\xe2\x80\x9d suddenly remarked Mary\xc3\xa1nka. \xe2\x80\x9cHe makes merry with his own money,\xe2\x80\x9d\nand lowering her legs she jumped down from the oven and went out\nbanging the door.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin followed her with his eyes as long as she was in the hut, and\nthen looked at the door and waited, understanding nothing of what\nGranny Ul\xc3\xadtka was telling him.\n\nA few minutes later some visitors arrived: an old man, Granny Ul\xc3\xadtka\xe2\x80\x99s\nbrother, with Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka, and following them came Mary\xc3\xa1nka and\n\xc3\x9astenka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood evening,\xe2\x80\x9d squeaked \xc3\x9astenka. \xe2\x80\x9cStill on holiday?\xe2\x80\x9d she added,\nturning to Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, still on holiday,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, and felt, he did not know why,\nashamed and ill at ease.\n\nHe wished to go away but could not. It also seemed to him impossible to\nremain silent. The old man helped him by asking for a drink, and they\nhad a drink. Ol\xc3\xa9nin drank with Er\xc3\xb3shka, with the other Cossack, and\nagain with Er\xc3\xb3shka, and the more he drank the heavier was his heart.\nBut the two old men grew merry. The girls climbed onto the oven, where\nthey sat whispering and looking at the men, who drank till it was late.\nOl\xc3\xa9nin did not talk, but drank more than the others. The Cossacks were\nshouting. The old woman would not let them have any more _chikhir_, and\nat last turned them out. The girls laughed at Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka, and it was\npast ten when they all went out into the porch. The old men invited\nthemselves to finish their merry-making at Ol\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s. \xc3\x9astenka ran off\nhome and Er\xc3\xb3shka led the old Cossack to Vany\xc3\xbasha. The old woman went\nout to tidy up the shed. Mary\xc3\xa1nka remained alone in the hut. Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nfelt fresh and joyous, as if he had only just woke up. He noticed\neverything, and having let the old men pass ahead he turned back to the\nhut where Mary\xc3\xa1nka was preparing for bed. He went up to her and wished\nto say something, but his voice broke. She moved away from him, sat\ndown cross-legged on her bed in the corner, and looked at him silently\nwith wild and frightened eyes. She was evidently afraid of him. Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nfelt this. He felt sorry and ashamed of himself, and at the same time\nproud and pleased that he aroused even that feeling in her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary\xc3\xa1nka!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you never take pity on me? I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you\nhow I love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe moved still farther away.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust hear how the wine is speaking! ... You\xe2\x80\x99ll get nothing from me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it is not the wine. Don\xe2\x80\x99t marry Luk\xc3\xa1shka. I will marry you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n(\xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I saying,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought as he uttered these words. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I be\nable to say the same tomorrow?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I shall, I am sure I shall, and I\nwill repeat them now,\xe2\x80\x9d replied an inner voice.)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you marry me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe looked at him seriously and her fear seemed to have passed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary\xc3\xa1nka, I shall go out of my mind! I am not myself. I will do\nwhatever you command,\xe2\x80\x9d and madly tender words came from his lips of\ntheir own accord.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, what are you drivelling about?\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted, suddenly\nseizing the arm he was stretching towards her. She did not push his arm\naway but pressed it firmly with her strong hard fingers. \xe2\x80\x9cDo gentlemen\nmarry Cossack girls? Go away!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut will you? Everything...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what shall we do with Luk\xc3\xa1shka?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, laughing.\n\nHe snatched away the arm she was holding and firmly embraced her young\nbody, but she sprang away like a fawn and ran barefoot into the porch:\nOl\xc3\xa9nin came to his senses and was terrified at himself. He again felt\nhimself inexpressibly vile compared to her, yet not repenting for an\ninstant of what he had said he went home, and without even glancing at\nthe old men who were drinking in his room he lay down and fell asleep\nmore soundly than he had done for a long time.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXXV\n\n\nThe next day was a holiday. In the evening all the villagers, their\nholiday clothes shining in the sunset, were out in the street. That\nseason more wine than usual had been produced, and the people were now\nfree from their labours. In a month the Cossacks were to start on a\ncampaign and in many families preparations were being made for\nweddings.\n\nMost of the people were standing in the square in front of the Cossack\nGovernment Office and near the two shops, in one of which cakes and\npumpkin seeds were sold, in the other kerchiefs and cotton prints. On\nthe earth-embankment of the office-building sat or stood the old men in\nsober grey, or black coats without gold trimmings or any kind of\nornament. They conversed among themselves quietly in measured tones,\nabout the harvest, about the young folk, about village affairs, and\nabout old times, looking with dignified equanimity at the younger\ngeneration. Passing by them, the women and girls stopped and bent their\nheads. The young Cossacks respectfully slackened their pace and raised\ntheir caps, holding them for a while over their heads. The old men then\nstopped speaking. Some of them watched the passers-by severely, others\nkindly, and in their turn slowly took off their caps and put them on\nagain.\n\nThe Cossack girls had not yet started dancing their _khorov\xc3\xb3ds_, but\nhaving gathered in groups, in their bright coloured _beshmets_ with\nwhite kerchiefs on their heads pulled down to their eyes, they sat\neither on the ground or on the earth-banks about the huts sheltered\nfrom the oblique rays of the sun, and laughed and chattered in their\nringing voices. Little boys and girls playing in the square sent their\nballs high up into the clear sky, and ran about squealing and shouting.\nThe half-grown girls had started dancing their _khorov\xc3\xb3ds_, and were\ntimidly singing in their thin shrill voices. Clerks, lads not in the\nservice, or home for the holiday, bright-faced and wearing smart white\nor new red Circassian gold-trimmed coats, went about arm in arm in twos\nor threes from one group of women or girls to another, and stopped to\njoke and chat with the Cossack girls. The Armenian shopkeeper, in a\ngold-trimmed coat of fine blue cloth, stood at the open door through\nwhich piles of folded bright-coloured kerchiefs were visible and,\nconscious of his own importance and with the pride of an Oriental\ntradesman, waited for customers. Two red-bearded, barefooted Ch\xc3\xa9chens,\nwho had come from beyond the T\xc3\xa9rek to see the f\xc3\xaate, sat on their heels\noutside the house of a friend, negligently smoking their little pipes\nand occasionally spitting, watching the villagers and exchanging\nremarks with one another in their rapid guttural speech. Occasionally a\nworkaday-looking soldier in an old overcoat passed across the square\namong the bright-clad girls. Here and there the songs of tipsy Cossacks\nwho were merry-making could already be heard. All the huts were closed;\nthe porches had been scrubbed clean the day before. Even the old women\nwere out in the street, which was everywhere sprinkled with pumpkin and\nmelon seed-shells. The air was warm and still, the sky deep and clear.\nBeyond the roofs the dead-white mountain range, which seemed very near,\nwas turning rosy in the glow of the evening sun. Now and then from the\nother side of the river came the distant roar of a cannon, but above\nthe village, mingling with one another, floated all sorts of merry\nholiday sounds.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin had been pacing the yard all that morning hoping to see\nMary\xc3\xa1nka. But she, having put on holiday clothes, went to Mass at the\nchapel and afterwards sat with the other girls on an earth-embankment\ncracking seeds; sometimes again, together with her companions, she ran\nhome, and each time gave the lodger a bright and kindly look. Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nfelt afraid to address her playfully or in the presence of others. He\nwished to finish telling her what he had begun to say the night before,\nand to get her to give him a definite answer. He waited for another\nmoment like that of yesterday evening, but the moment did not come, and\nhe felt that he could not remain any longer in this uncertainty. She\nwent out into the street again, and after waiting awhile he too went\nout and without knowing where he was going he followed her. He passed\nby the corner where she was sitting in her shining blue satin\n_beshmet_, and with an aching heart he heard behind him the girls\nlaughing.\n\nBel\xc3\xa9tski\xe2\x80\x99s hut looked out onto the square. As Ol\xc3\xa9nin was passing it he\nheard Bel\xc3\xa9tski\xe2\x80\x99s voice calling to him, \xe2\x80\x9cCome in,\xe2\x80\x9d and in he went.\n\nAfter a short talk they both sat down by the window and were soon\njoined by Er\xc3\xb3shka, who entered dressed in a new _beshmet_ and sat down\non the floor beside them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, that\xe2\x80\x99s the aristocratic party,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bel\xc3\xa9tski, pointing with\nhis cigarette to a brightly coloured group at the corner. \xe2\x80\x9cMine is\nthere too. Do you see her? in red. That\xe2\x80\x99s a new _beshmet_. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t\nyou start the _khorov\xc3\xb3d?_\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, leaning out of the window. \xe2\x80\x9cWait\na bit, and then when it grows dark let us go too. Then we will invite\nthem to \xc3\x9astenka\xe2\x80\x99s. We must arrange a ball for them!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I will come to \xc3\x9astenka\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin in a decided tone. \xe2\x80\x9cWill\nMary\xc3\xa1nka be there?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be there. Do come!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bel\xc3\xa9tski, without the least\nsurprise. \xe2\x80\x9cBut isn\xe2\x80\x99t it a pretty picture?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, pointing to the\nmotley crowds.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, very!\xe2\x80\x9d Ol\xc3\xa9nin assented, trying to appear indifferent.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHolidays of this kind,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9calways make me wonder why all these\npeople should suddenly be contented and jolly. Today for instance, just\nbecause it happens to be the fifteenth of the month, everything is\nfestive. Eyes and faces and voices and movements and garments, and the\nair and the sun, are all in a holiday mood. And we no longer have any\nholidays!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bel\xc3\xa9tski, who did not like such reflections.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why are you not drinking, old fellow?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning to\nEr\xc3\xb3shka.\n\nEr\xc3\xb3shka winked at Ol\xc3\xa9nin, pointing to Bel\xc3\xa9tski. \xe2\x80\x9cEh, he\xe2\x80\x99s a proud one\nthat _kunak_ of yours,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nBel\xc3\xa9tski raised his glass.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Allah birdy!_\xe2\x80\x9d he said, emptying it. (_Allah birdy_, \xe2\x80\x9cGod has\ngiven!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the usual greeting of Caucasians when drinking together.)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Sau bul_\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cYour health\xe2\x80\x9d), answered Er\xc3\xb3shka smiling, and emptied his\nglass.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeaking of holidays!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning to Ol\xc3\xa9nin as he rose and\nlooked out of the window, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of holiday is that! You should\nhave seen them make merry in the old days! The women used to come out\nin their gold-trimmed _saraf\xc3\xa1ns_. Two rows of gold coins hanging round\ntheir necks and gold-cloth diadems on their heads, and when they passed\nthey made a noise, \xe2\x80\x98flu, flu,\xe2\x80\x99 with their dresses. Every woman looked\nlike a princess. Sometimes they\xe2\x80\x99d come out, a whole herd of them, and\nbegin singing songs so that the air seemed to rumble, and they went on\nmaking merry all night. And the Cossacks would roll out a barrel into\nthe yards and sit down and drink till break of day, or they would go\nhand-in-hand sweeping the village. Whoever they met they seized and\ntook along with them, and went from house to house. Sometimes they used\nto make merry for three days on end. Father used to come home\xe2\x80\x94I still\nremember it\xe2\x80\x94quite red and swollen, without a cap, having lost\neverything: he\xe2\x80\x99d come and lie down. Mother knew what to do: she would\nbring him some fresh caviar and a little _chikhir_ to sober him up, and\nwould herself run about in the village looking for his cap. Then he\xe2\x80\x99d\nsleep for two days! That\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of fellows they were then! But now\nwhat are they?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and the girls in the _saraf\xc3\xa1ns_, did they make merry all by\nthemselves?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bel\xc3\xa9tski.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, they did! Sometimes Cossacks would come on foot or on horse and\nsay, \xe2\x80\x98Let\xe2\x80\x99s break up the _khorov\xc3\xb3ds_,\xe2\x80\x99 and they\xe2\x80\x99d go, but the girls\nwould take up cudgels. Carnival week, some young fellow would come\ngalloping up, and they\xe2\x80\x99d cudgel his horse and cudgel him too. But he\xe2\x80\x99d\nbreak through, seize the one he loved, and carry her off. And his\nsweetheart would love him to his heart\xe2\x80\x99s content! Yes, the girls in\nthose days, they were regular queens!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXXVI\n\n\nJust then two men rode out of the side street into the square. One of\nthem was Naz\xc3\xa1rka. The other, Luk\xc3\xa1shka, sat slightly sideways on his\nwell-fed bay Kabard\xc3\xa1 horse which stepped lightly over the hard road\njerking its beautiful head with its fine glossy mane. The well-adjusted\ngun in its cover, the pistol at his back, and the cloak rolled up\nbehind his saddle showed that Luk\xc3\xa1shka had not come from a peaceful\nplace or from one near by. The smart way in which he sat a little\nsideways on his horse, the careless motion with which he touched the\nhorse under its belly with his whip, and especially his half-closed\nblack eyes, glistening as he looked proudly around him, all expressed\nthe conscious strength and self-confidence of youth. \xe2\x80\x9cEver seen as fine\na lad?\xe2\x80\x9d his eyes, looking from side to side, seemed to say. The elegant\nhorse with its silver ornaments and trappings, the weapons, and the\nhandsome Cossack himself attracted the attention of everyone in the\nsquare. Naz\xc3\xa1rka, lean and short, was much less well dressed. As he rode\npast the old men, Luk\xc3\xa1shka paused and raised his curly white sheepskin\ncap above his closely cropped black head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, have you carried off many Nog\xc3\xa1y horses?\xe2\x80\x9d asked a lean old man\nwith a frowning, lowering look.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you counted them, Grandad, that you ask?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Luk\xc3\xa1shka,\nturning away.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all very well, but you need not take my lad along with you,\xe2\x80\x9d\nthe old man muttered with a still darker frown.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust see the old devil, he knows everything,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Luk\xc3\xa1shka to\nhimself, and a worried expression came over his face; but then,\nnoticing a corner where a number of Cossack girls were standing, he\nturned his horse towards them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood evening, girls!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted in his powerful, resonant voice,\nsuddenly checking his horse. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve grown old without me, you\nwitches!\xe2\x80\x9d and he laughed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood evening, Luk\xc3\xa1shka! Good evening, laddie!\xe2\x80\x9d the merry voices\nanswered. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you brought much money? Buy some sweets for the\ngirls!... Have you come for long? True enough, it\xe2\x80\x99s long since we saw\nyou....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNaz\xc3\xa1rka and I have just flown across to make a night of it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka, raising his whip and riding straight at the girls.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mary\xc3\xa1nka has quite forgotten you,\xe2\x80\x9d said \xc3\x9astenka, nudging Mary\xc3\xa1nka\nwith her elbow and breaking into a shrill laugh.\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka moved away from the horse and throwing back her head calmly\nlooked at the Cossack with her large sparkling eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue enough, you have not been home for a long time! Why are you\ntrampling us under your horse?\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked dryly, and turned away.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka had appeared particularly merry. His face shone with audacity\nand joy. Obviously staggered by Mary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s cold reply he suddenly\nknitted his brow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStep up on my stirrup and I\xe2\x80\x99ll carry you away to the mountains.\nMammy!\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly exclaimed, and as if to disperse his dark thoughts\nhe caracoled among the girls. Stooping down towards Mary\xc3\xa1nka, he said,\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll kiss, oh, how I\xe2\x80\x99ll kiss you! ...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka\xe2\x80\x99s eyes met his and she suddenly blushed and stepped back.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, bother you! you\xe2\x80\x99ll crush my feet,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and bending her head\nlooked at her well-shaped feet in their tightly fitting light blue\nstockings with clocks and her new red slippers trimmed with narrow\nsilver braid.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka turned towards \xc3\x9astenka, and Mary\xc3\xa1nka sat down next to a woman\nwith a baby in her arms. The baby stretched his plump little hands\ntowards the girl and seized a necklace string that hung down onto her\nblue _beshmet_. Mary\xc3\xa1nka bent towards the child and glanced at Luk\xc3\xa1shka\nfrom the corner of her eyes. Luk\xc3\xa1shka just then was getting out from\nunder his coat, from the pocket of his black _beshmet_, a bundle of\nsweetmeats and seeds.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, I give them to all of you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, handing the bundle to\n\xc3\x9astenka and smiling at Mary\xc3\xa1nka.\n\nA confused expression again appeared on the girl\xe2\x80\x99s face. It was as\nthough a mist gathered over her beautiful eyes. She drew her kerchief\ndown below her lips, and leaning her head over the fair-skinned face of\nthe baby that still held her by her coin necklace she suddenly began to\nkiss it greedily. The baby pressed his little hands against the girl\xe2\x80\x99s\nhigh breasts, and opening his toothless mouth screamed loudly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re smothering the boy!\xe2\x80\x9d said the little one\xe2\x80\x99s mother, taking him\naway; and she unfastened her _beshmet_ to give him the breast. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d\nbetter have a chat with the young fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll only go and put up my horse and then Naz\xc3\xa1rka and I will come\nback; we\xe2\x80\x99ll make merry all night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, touching his horse\nwith his whip and riding away from the girls.\n\nTurning into a side street, he and Naz\xc3\xa1rka rode up to two huts that\nstood side by side.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere we are all right, old fellow! Be quick and come soon!\xe2\x80\x9d called\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka to his comrade, dismounting in front of one of the huts; then\nhe carefully led his horse in at the gate of the wattle fence of his\nown home.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow d\xe2\x80\x99you do, St\xc3\xabpka?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to his dumb sister, who, smartly\ndressed like the others, came in from the street to take his horse; and\nhe made signs to her to take the horse to the hay, but not to unsaddle\nit.\n\nThe dumb girl made her usual humming noise, smacked her lips as she\npointed to the horse and kissed it on the nose, as much as to say that\nshe loved it and that it was a fine horse.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow d\xe2\x80\x99you do, Mother? How is it that you have not gone out yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\nshouted Luk\xc3\xa1shka, holding his gun in place as he mounted the steps of\nthe porch.\n\nHis old mother opened the door.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me! I never expected, never thought, you\xe2\x80\x99d come,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old\nwoman. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, K\xc3\xadrka said you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and bring some _chikhir_, Mother. Naz\xc3\xa1rka is coming here and we\nwill celebrate the feast day.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDirectly, Luk\xc3\xa1shka, directly!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the old woman. \xe2\x80\x9cOur women are\nmaking merry. I expect our dumb one has gone too.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe took her keys and hurriedly went to the outhouse. Naz\xc3\xa1rka, after\nputting up his horse and taking the gun off his shoulder, returned to\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s house and went in.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXXVII\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour health!\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, taking from his mother\xe2\x80\x99s hands a cup\nfilled to the brim with _chikhir_ and carefully raising it to his bowed\nhead.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bad business!\xe2\x80\x9d said Naz\xc3\xa1rka. \xe2\x80\x9cYou heard how Daddy Burl\xc3\xa1k said, \xe2\x80\x98Have\nyou stolen many horses?\xe2\x80\x99 He seems to know!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA regular wizard!\xe2\x80\x9d Luk\xc3\xa1shka replied shortly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what of it!\xe2\x80\x9d he\nadded, tossing his head. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are across the river by now. Go and find\nthem!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill it\xe2\x80\x99s a bad lookout.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s a bad lookout? Go and take some _chikhir_ to him tomorrow and\nnothing will come of it. Now let\xe2\x80\x99s make merry. Drink!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka, just in the tone in which old Er\xc3\xb3shka uttered the word.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll go out into the street and make merry with the girls. You go and\nget some honey; or no, I\xe2\x80\x99ll send our dumb wench. We\xe2\x80\x99ll make merry till\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka smiled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre we stopping here long?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTill we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a bit of fun. Run and get some vodka. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the\nmoney.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka ran off obediently to get the vodka from Y\xc3\xa1mka\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\nDaddy Er\xc3\xb3shka and Ergush\xc3\xb3v, like birds of prey, scenting where the\nmerry-making was going on, tumbled into the hut one after the other,\nboth tipsy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring us another half-pail,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Luk\xc3\xa1shka to his mother, by way of\nreply to their greeting.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, tell us where did you steal them, you devil?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted\nEr\xc3\xb3shka. \xe2\x80\x9cFine fellow, I\xe2\x80\x99m fond of you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFond indeed...\xe2\x80\x9d answered Luk\xc3\xa1shka laughing, \xe2\x80\x9ccarrying sweets from\ncadets to lasses! Eh, you old...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not true, not true! ... Oh, Mark,\xe2\x80\x9d and the old man burst out\nlaughing. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how that devil begged me. \xe2\x80\x98Go,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98and arrange\nit.\xe2\x80\x99 He offered me a gun! But no. I\xe2\x80\x99d have managed it, but I feel for\nyou. Now tell us where have you been?\xe2\x80\x9d And the old man began speaking\nin Tartar.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka answered him promptly.\n\nErgush\xc3\xb3v, who did not know much Tartar, only occasionally put in a word\nin Russian: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I say is he\xe2\x80\x99s driven away the horses. I know it for a\nfact,\xe2\x80\x9d he chimed in.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGir\xc3\xa9y and I went together.\xe2\x80\x9d (His speaking of Gir\xc3\xa9y Khan as \xe2\x80\x9cGir\xc3\xa9y\xe2\x80\x9d\nwas, to the Cossack mind, evidence of his boldness.) \xe2\x80\x9cJust beyond the\nriver he kept bragging that he knew the whole of the steppe and would\nlead the way straight, but we rode on and the night was dark, and my\nGir\xc3\xa9y lost his way and began wandering in a circle without getting\nanywhere: couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find the village, and there we were. We must have\ngone too much to the right. I believe we wandered about well-nigh till\nmidnight. Then, thank goodness, we heard dogs howling.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFools!\xe2\x80\x9d said Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka. \xe2\x80\x9cThere now, we too used to lose our way in\nthe steppe. (Who the devil can follow it?) But I used to ride up a\nhillock and start howling like the wolves, like this!\xe2\x80\x9d He placed his\nhands before his mouth, and howled like a pack of wolves, all on one\nnote. \xe2\x80\x9cThe dogs would answer at once ... Well, go on\xe2\x80\x94so you found\nthem?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe soon led them away! Naz\xc3\xa1rka was nearly caught by some Nog\xc3\xa1y women,\nhe was!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaught indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d Naz\xc3\xa1rka, who had just come back, said in an injured\ntone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe rode off again, and again Gir\xc3\xa9y lost his way and almost landed us\namong the sand-drifts. We thought we were just getting to the T\xc3\xa9rek but\nwe were riding away from it all the time!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should have steered by the stars,\xe2\x80\x9d said Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I say,\xe2\x80\x9d interjected Ergush\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, steer when all is black; I tried and tried all about... and at\nlast I put the bridle on one of the mares and let my own horse go\nfree\xe2\x80\x94thinking he\xe2\x80\x99ll lead us out, and what do you think! he just gave a\nsnort or two with his nose to the ground, galloped ahead, and led us\nstraight to our village. Thank goodness! It was getting quite light. We\nbarely had time to hide them in the forest. Nag\xc3\xadm came across the river\nand took them away.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nErgush\xc3\xb3v shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just what I said. Smart. Did you get\nmuch for them?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, slapping his pocket.\n\nJust then his mother came into the room, and Luk\xc3\xa1shka did not finish\nwhat he was saying.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrink!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe too, G\xc3\xadrich and I, rode out late one night...\xe2\x80\x9d began Er\xc3\xb3shka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh bother, we\xe2\x80\x99ll never hear the end of you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\ngoing.\xe2\x80\x9d And having emptied his cup and tightened the strap of his belt\nhe went out.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXXVIII\n\n\nIt was already dark when Luk\xc3\xa1shka went out into the street. The autumn\nnight was fresh and calm. The full golden moon floated up behind the\ntall dark poplars that grew on one side of the square. From the\nchimneys of the outhouses smoke rose and spread above the village,\nmingling with the mist. Here and there lights shone through the\nwindows, and the air was laden with the smell of _kisyak_, grape-pulp,\nand mist. The sounds of voices, laughter, songs, and the cracking of\nseeds mingled just as they had done in the daytime, but were now more\ndistinct. Clusters of white kerchiefs and caps gleamed through the\ndarkness near the houses and by the fences.\n\nIn the square, before the shop door which was lit up and open, the\nblack and white figures of Cossack men and maids showed through the\ndarkness, and one heard from afar their loud songs and laughter and\ntalk. The girls, hand in hand, went round and round in a circle\nstepping lightly in the dusty square. A skinny girl, the plainest of\nthem all, set the tune:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom beyond the wood, from the forest dark,\nFrom the garden green and the shady park,\nThere came out one day two young lads so gay.\nYoung bachelors, hey! brave and smart were they!\nAnd they walked and walked, then stood still, each man,\nAnd they talked and soon to dispute began!\nThen a maid came out; as she came along,\nSaid, \xe2\x80\x98To one of you I shall soon belong!\xe2\x80\x99\n\xe2\x80\x99Twas the fair-faced lad got the maiden fair,\nYes, the fair-faced lad with the golden hair!\nHer right hand so white in his own took he,\nAnd he led her round for his mates to see!\nAnd said, \xe2\x80\x98Have you ever in all your life,\nMet a lass as fair as my sweet little wife?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nThe old women stood round listening to the songs. The little boys and\ngirls ran about chasing one another in the dark. The men stood by,\ncatching at the girls as the latter moved round, and sometimes breaking\nthe ring and entering it. On the dark side of the doorway stood\nBel\xc3\xa9tski and Ol\xc3\xa9nin, in their Circassian coats and sheepskin caps, and\ntalked together in a style of speech unlike that of the Cossacks, in\nlow but distinct tones, conscious that they were attracting attention.\n\nNext to one another in the _khorov\xc3\xb3d_ circle moved plump little \xc3\x9astenka\nin her red _beshmet_ and the stately Mary\xc3\xa1nka in her new smock and\n_beshmet_. Ol\xc3\xa9nin and Bel\xc3\xa9tski were discussing how to snatch \xc3\x9astenka\nand Mary\xc3\xa1nka out of the ring. Bel\xc3\xa9tski thought that Ol\xc3\xa9nin wished only\nto amuse himself, but Ol\xc3\xa9nin was expecting his fate to be decided. He\nwanted at any cost to see Mary\xc3\xa1nka alone that very day and to tell her\neverything, and ask her whether she could and would be his wife.\nAlthough that question had long been answered in the negative in his\nown mind, he hoped he would be able to tell her all he felt, and that\nshe would understand him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you not tell me sooner?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bel\xc3\xa9tski. \xe2\x80\x9cI would have got\n\xc3\x9astenka to arrange it for you. You are such a queer fellow! ...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s to be done! ... Some day, very soon, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you all about\nit. Only now, for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, arrange so that she should come to\n\xc3\x9astenka\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, that\xe2\x80\x99s easily done! Well, Mary\xc3\xa1nka, will you belong to the\n\xe2\x80\x98fair-faced lad\xe2\x80\x99, and not to Luk\xc3\xa1shka?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bel\xc3\xa9tski, speaking to\nMary\xc3\xa1nka first for propriety\xe2\x80\x99s sake, but having received no reply he\nwent up to \xc3\x9astenka and begged her to bring Mary\xc3\xa1nka home with her. He\nhad hardly time to finish what he was saying before the leader began\nanother song and the girls started pulling each other round in the ring\nby the hand.\n\nThey sang:\n\nPast the garden, by the garden,\nA young man came strolling down,\nUp the street and through the town.\nAnd the first time as he passed\nHe did wave his strong right hand.\nAs the second time he passed\nWaved his hat with silken band.\nBut the third time as he went\nHe stood still: before her bent.\n\nHow is it that thou, my dear,\nMy reproaches dost not fear?\nIn the park don\xe2\x80\x99t come to walk\nThat we there might have a talk?\nCome now, answer me, my dear,\nDost thou hold me in contempt?\nLater on, thou knowest, dear,\nThou\xe2\x80\x99lt get sober and repent.\nSoon to woo thee I will come,\nAnd when we shall married be\nThou wilt weep because of me!\n\nThough I knew what to reply,\nYet I dared not him deny,\nNo, I dared not him deny!\nSo into the park went I,\nIn the park my lad to meet,\nThere my dear one I did greet.\n\nMaiden dear, I bow to thee!\nTake this handkerchief from me.\nIn thy white hand take it, see!\nSay I am beloved by thee.\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know at all, I fear,\nWhat I am to give thee, dear!\nTo my dear I think I will\nOf a shawl a present make\xe2\x80\x94\nAnd five kisses for it take.\n\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka and Naz\xc3\xa1rka broke into the ring and started walking about\namong the girls. Luk\xc3\xa1shka joined in the singing, taking seconds in his\nclear voice as he walked in the middle of the ring swinging his arms.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, come in, one of you!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. The other girls pushed Mary\xc3\xa1nka,\nbut she would not enter the ring. The sound of shrill laughter, slaps,\nkisses, and whispers mingled with the singing.\n\nAs he went past Ol\xc3\xa9nin, Luk\xc3\xa1shka gave a friendly nod.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDm\xc3\xadtri Andr\xc3\xa9ich! Have you too come to have a look?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ol\xc3\xa9nin dryly.\n\nBel\xc3\xa9tski stooped and whispered something into \xc3\x9astenka\xe2\x80\x99s ear. She had\nnot time to reply till she came round again, when she said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, we\xe2\x80\x99ll come.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mary\xc3\xa1nka too?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin stooped towards Mary\xc3\xa1nka. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll come? Please do, if only for a\nminute. I must speak to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the other girls come, I will.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you answer my question?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, bending towards her. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\nin good spirits today.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe had already moved past him. He went after her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you answer?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnswer what?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe question I asked you the other day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin, stooping to her\near. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you marry me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka thought for a moment.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd through the darkness her eyes gleamed brightly and kindly at the\nyoung man.\n\nHe still followed her. He enjoyed stooping closer to her. But Luk\xc3\xa1shka,\nwithout ceasing to sing, suddenly seized her firmly by the hand and\npulled her from her place in the ring of girls into the middle. Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nhad only time to say, \xe2\x80\x9cCome to \xc3\x9astenka\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d and stepped back to his\ncompanion.\n\nThe song came to an end. Luk\xc3\xa1shka wiped his lips, Mary\xc3\xa1nka did the\nsame, and they kissed. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, kisses five!\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka. Chatter,\nlaughter, and running about, succeeded to the rhythmic movements and\nsound. Luk\xc3\xa1shka, who seemed to have drunk a great deal, began to\ndistribute sweetmeats to the girls.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI offer them to everyone!\xe2\x80\x9d he said with proud, comically pathetic\nself-admiration. \xe2\x80\x9cBut anyone who goes after soldiers goes out of the\nring!\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly added, with an angry glance at Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\nThe girls grabbed his sweetmeats from him, and, laughing, struggled for\nthem among themselves. Bel\xc3\xa9tski and Ol\xc3\xa9nin stepped aside.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka, as if ashamed of his generosity, took off his cap and wiping\nhis forehead with his sleeve came up to Mary\xc3\xa1nka and \xc3\x9astenka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnswer me, my dear, dost thou hold me in contempt?\xe2\x80\x9d he said in the\nwords of the song they had just been singing, and turning to Mary\xc3\xa1nka\nhe angrily repeated the words: \xe2\x80\x9cDost thou hold me in contempt? When we\nshall married be thou wilt weep because of me!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, embracing\n\xc3\x9astenka and Mary\xc3\xa1nka both together.\n\n\xc3\x9astenka tore herself away, and swinging her arm gave him such a blow on\nthe back that she hurt her hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, are you going to have another turn?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe other girls may if they like,\xe2\x80\x9d answered \xc3\x9astenka, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am going\nhome and Mary\xc3\xa1nka was coming to our house too.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWith his arm still round her, Luk\xc3\xa1shka led Mary\xc3\xa1nka away from the crowd\nto the darker corner of a house.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go, Mary\xc3\xa1nka,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9clet\xe2\x80\x99s have some fun for the last time.\nGo home and I will come to you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I to do at home? Holidays are meant for merrymaking. I am\ngoing to \xc3\x9astenka\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mary\xc3\xa1nka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll marry you all the same, you know!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary\xc3\xa1nka, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall see when the time comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you are going,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka sternly, and, pressing her close, he\nkissed her on the cheek.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, leave off! Don\xe2\x80\x99t bother,\xe2\x80\x9d and Mary\xc3\xa1nka, wrenching herself from\nhis arms, moved away.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh my girl, it will turn out badly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka reproachfully and\nstood still, shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x9cThou wilt weep because of me...\xe2\x80\x9d and\nturning away from her he shouted to the other girls:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then! Play away!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhat he had said seemed to have frightened and vexed Mary\xc3\xa1nka. She\nstopped, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat will turn out badly?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat what?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that you keep company with a soldier-lodger and no longer care\nfor me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll care just as long as I choose. You\xe2\x80\x99re not my father, nor my\nmother. What do you want? I\xe2\x80\x99ll care for whom I like!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, all right...\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, \xe2\x80\x9cbut remember!\xe2\x80\x9d He moved towards\nthe shop. \xe2\x80\x9cGirls!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy have you stopped? Go on dancing.\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka, fetch some more _chikhir_.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, will they come?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin, addressing Bel\xc3\xa9tski.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll come directly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Bel\xc3\xa9tski. \xe2\x80\x9cCome along, we must prepare\nthe ball.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XXXIX\n\n\nIt was already late in the night when Ol\xc3\xa9nin came out of Bel\xc3\xa9tski\xe2\x80\x99s hut\nfollowing Mary\xc3\xa1nka and \xc3\x9astenka. He saw in the dark street before him\nthe gleam of the girl\xe2\x80\x99s white kerchief. The golden moon was descending\ntowards the steppe. A silvery mist hung over the village. All was\nstill; there were no lights anywhere and one heard only the receding\nfootsteps of the young women. Ol\xc3\xa9nin\xe2\x80\x99s heart beat fast. The fresh moist\natmosphere cooled his burning face. He glanced at the sky and turned to\nlook at the hut he had just come out of: the candle was already out.\nThen he again peered through the darkness at the girls\xe2\x80\x99 retreating\nshadows. The white kerchief disappeared in the mist. He was afraid to\nremain alone, he was so happy. He jumped down from the porch and ran\nafter the girls.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBother you, someone may see...\xe2\x80\x9d said \xc3\x9astenka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin ran up to Mary\xc3\xa1nka and embraced her.\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka did not resist.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you kissed enough yet?\xe2\x80\x9d said \xc3\x9astenka. \xe2\x80\x9cMarry and then kiss,\nbut now you\xe2\x80\x99d better wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, Mary\xc3\xa1nka. Tomorrow I will come to see your father and tell\nhim. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you say anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mary\xc3\xa1nka.\n\nBoth the girls started running. Ol\xc3\xa9nin went on by himself thinking over\nall that had happened. He had spent the whole evening alone with her in\na corner by the oven. \xc3\x9astenka had not left the hut for a single moment,\nbut had romped about with the other girls and with Bel\xc3\xa9tski all the\ntime. Ol\xc3\xa9nin had talked in whispers to Mary\xc3\xa1nka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you marry me?\xe2\x80\x9d he had asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d deceive me and not have me,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied cheerfully and calmly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut do you love me? Tell me for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I love you? You don\xe2\x80\x99t squint,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mary\xc3\xa1nka,\nlaughing and with her hard hands squeezing his....\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat whi-ite, whi-i-ite, soft hands you\xe2\x80\x99ve got\xe2\x80\x94so like clotted cream,\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am in earnest. Tell me, will you marry me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not, if father gives me to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then remember, I shall go mad if you deceive me. Tomorrow I will\ntell your mother and father. I shall come and propose.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka suddenly burst out laughing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems so funny!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s true! I will buy a vineyard and a house and will enroll myself as\na Cossack.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind you don\xe2\x80\x99t go after other women then. I am severe about that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin joyfully repeated all these words to himself. The memory of them\nnow gave him pain and now such joy that it took away his breath. The\npain was because she had remained as calm as usual while talking to\nhim. She did not seem at all agitated by these new conditions. It was\nas if she did not trust him and did not think of the future. It seemed\nto him that she only loved him for the present moment, and that in her\nmind there was no future with him. He was happy because her words\nsounded to him true, and she had consented to be his. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he\nto himself, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall only understand one another when she is quite\nmine. For such love there are no words. It needs life\xe2\x80\x94the whole of\nlife. Tomorrow everything will be cleared up. I cannot live like this\nany longer; tomorrow I will tell everything to her father, to Bel\xc3\xa9tski,\nand to the whole village.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka, after two sleepless nights, had drunk so much at the f\xc3\xaate\nthat for the first time in his life his feet would not carry him, and\nhe slept in Y\xc3\xa1mka\xe2\x80\x99s house.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XL\n\n\nThe next day Ol\xc3\xa9nin awoke earlier than usual, and immediately\nremembered what lay before him, and he joyfully recalled her kisses,\nthe pressure of her hard hands, and her words, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat white hands you\nhave!\xe2\x80\x9d He jumped up and wished to go at once to his hosts\xe2\x80\x99 hut to ask\nfor their consent to his marriage with Mary\xc3\xa1nka. The sun had not yet\nrisen, but it seemed that there was an unusual bustle in the street and\nside-street: people were moving about on foot and on horseback, and\ntalking. He threw on his Circassian coat and hastened out into the\nporch. His hosts were not yet up. Five Cossacks were riding past and\ntalking loudly together. In front rode Luk\xc3\xa1shka on his broad-backed\nKabard\xc3\xa1 horse.\n\nThe Cossacks were all speaking and shouting so that it was impossible\nto make out exactly what they were saying.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRide to the Upper Post,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted one.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaddle and catch us up, be quick,\xe2\x80\x9d said another.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nearer through the other gate!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Luk\xc3\xa1shka. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must go through the\nmiddle gates, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo we must, it\xe2\x80\x99s nearer that way,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the Cossacks who was\ncovered with dust and rode a perspiring horse. Luk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s face was red\nand swollen after the drinking of the previous night and his cap was\npushed to the back of his head. He was calling out with authority as\nthough he were an officer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter? Where are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin, with\ndifficulty attracting the Cossacks\xe2\x80\x99 attention.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are off to catch _abreks_. They\xe2\x80\x99re hiding among the sand-drifts. We\nare just off, but there are not enough of us yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the Cossacks continued to shout, more and more of them joining as\nthey rode down the street. It occurred to Ol\xc3\xa9nin that it would not look\nwell for him to stay behind; besides he thought he could soon come\nback. He dressed, loaded his gun with bullets, jumped onto his horse\nwhich Vany\xc3\xbasha had saddled more or less well, and overtook the Cossacks\nat the village gates. The Cossacks had dismounted, and filling a wooden\nbowl with _chikhir_ from a little cask which they had brought with\nthem, they passed the bowl round to one another and drank to the\nsuccess of their expedition. Among them was a smartly dressed young\ncornet, who happened to be in the village and who took command of the\ngroup of nine Cossacks who had joined for the expedition. All these\nCossacks were privates, and although the cornet assumed the airs of a\ncommanding officer, they only obeyed Luk\xc3\xa1shka. Of Ol\xc3\xa9nin they took no\nnotice at all, and when they had all mounted and started, and Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nrode up to the cornet and began asking him what was taking place, the\ncornet, who was usually quite friendly, treated him with marked\ncondescension. It was with great difficulty that Ol\xc3\xa9nin managed to find\nout from him what was happening. Scouts who had been sent out to search\nfor _abreks_ had come upon several hillsmen some six miles from the\nvillage. These _abreks_ had taken shelter in pits and had fired at the\nscouts, declaring they would not surrender. A corporal who had been\nscouting with two Cossacks had remained to watch the _abreks_, and had\nsent one Cossack back to get help.\n\nThe sun was just rising. Three miles beyond the village the steppe\nspread out and nothing was visible except the dry, monotonous, sandy,\ndismal plain covered with the footmarks of cattle, and here and there\nwith tufts of withered grass, with low reeds in the flats, and rare,\nlittle-trodden footpaths, and the camps of the nomad Nog\xc3\xa1y tribe just\nvisible far away. The absence of shade and the austere aspect of the\nplace were striking. The sun always rises and sets red in the steppe.\nWhen it is windy whole hills of sand are carried by the wind from place\nto place.\n\nWhen it is calm, as it was that morning, the silence, uninterrupted by\nany movement or sound, is peculiarly striking. That morning in the\nsteppe it was quiet and dull, though the sun had already risen. It all\nseemed specially soft and desolate. The air was hushed, the footfalls\nand the snorting of the horses were the only sounds to be heard, and\neven they quickly died away.\n\nThe men rode almost silently. A Cossack always carries his weapons so\nthat they neither jingle nor rattle. Jingling weapons are a terrible\ndisgrace to a Cossack. Two other Cossacks from the village caught the\nparty up and exchanged a few words. Luk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s horse either stumbled or\ncaught its foot in some grass, and became restive\xe2\x80\x94which is a sign of\nbad luck among the Cossacks, and at such a time was of special\nimportance. The others exchanged glances and turned away, trying not to\nnotice what had happened. Lukaskha pulled at the reins, frowned\nsternly, set his teeth, and flourished his whip above his head. His\ngood Kabard\xc3\xa1 horse, prancing from one foot to another not knowing with\nwhich to start, seemed to wish to fly upwards on wings. But Luk\xc3\xa1shka\nhit its well-fed sides with his whip once, then again, and a third\ntime, and the horse, showing its teeth and spreading out its tail,\nsnorted and reared and stepped on its hind legs a few paces away from\nthe others.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, a good steed that!\xe2\x80\x9d said the cornet.\n\nThat he said _steed_ instead of _horse_ indicated special praise.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lion of a horse,\xe2\x80\x9d assented one of the others, an old Cossack.\n\nThe Cossacks rode forward silently, now at a footpace, then at a trot,\nand these changes were the only incidents that interrupted for a moment\nthe stillness and solemnity of their movements.\n\nRiding through the steppe for about six miles, they passed nothing but\none Nog\xc3\xa1y tent, placed on a cart and moving slowly along at a distance\nof about a mile from them. A Nog\xc3\xa1y family was moving from one part of\nthe steppe to another. Afterwards they met two tattered Nog\xc3\xa1y women\nwith high cheekbones, who with baskets on their backs were gathering\ndung left by the cattle that wandered over the steppe. The cornet, who\ndid not know their language well, tried to question them, but they did\nnot understand him and, obviously frightened, looked at one another.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka rode up to them both, stopped his horse, and promptly uttered\nthe usual greeting. The Nog\xc3\xa1y women were evidently relieved, and began\nspeaking to him quite freely as to a brother.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Ay-ay, kop abrek!_\xe2\x80\x9d they said plaintively, pointing in the direction\nin which the Cossacks were going. Ol\xc3\xa9nin understood that they were\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cMany _abreks_.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNever having seen an engagement of that kind, and having formed an idea\nof them only from Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka\xe2\x80\x99s tales, Ol\xc3\xa9nin wished not to be left\nbehind by the Cossacks, but wanted to see it all. He admired the\nCossacks, and was on the watch, looking and listening and making his\nown observations. Though he had brought his sword and a loaded gun with\nhim, when he noticed that the Cossacks avoided him he decided to take\nno part in the action, as in his opinion his courage had already been\nsufficiently proved when he was with his detachment, and also because\nhe was very happy.\n\nSuddenly a shot was heard in the distance.\n\nThe cornet became excited, and began giving orders to the Cossacks as\nto how they should divide and from which side they should approach. But\nthe Cossacks did not appear to pay any attention to these orders,\nlistening only to what Luk\xc3\xa1shka said and looking to him alone.\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s face and figure were expressive of calm solemnity. He put\nhis horse to a trot with which the others were unable to keep pace, and\nscrewing up his eyes kept looking ahead.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a man on horseback,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, reining in his horse and keeping\nin line with the others.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin looked intently, but could not see anything. The Cossacks soon\ndistinguished two riders and quietly rode straight towards them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre those the _abreks?_\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\nThe Cossacks did not answer his question, which appeared quite\nmeaningless to them. The _abreks_ would have been fools to venture\nacross the river on horseback.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s friend R\xc3\xb3dka waving to us, I do believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka,\npointing to the two mounted men who were now clearly visible. \xe2\x80\x9cLook,\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s coming to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA few minutes later it became plain that the two horsemen were the\nCossack scouts. The corporal rode up to Luk\xc3\xa1shka.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XLI\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre they far?\xe2\x80\x9d was all Luk\xc3\xa1shka said.\n\nJust then they heard a sharp shot some thirty paces off. The corporal\nsmiled slightly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur G\xc3\xbarka is having shots at them,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, nodding in the direction\nof the shot.\n\nHaving gone a few paces farther they saw G\xc3\xbarka sitting behind a\nsand-hillock and loading his gun. To while away the time he was\nexchanging shots with the _abreks_, who were behind another sand-heap.\nA bullet came whistling from their side.\n\nThe cornet was pale and grew confused. Luk\xc3\xa1shka dismounted from his\nhorse, threw the reins to one of the other Cossacks, and went up to\nG\xc3\xbarka. Ol\xc3\xa9nin also dismounted and, bending down, followed Luk\xc3\xa1shka.\nThey had hardly reached G\xc3\xbarka when two bullets whistled above them.\n\nLuk\xc3\xa1shka looked around laughing at Ol\xc3\xa9nin and stooped a little.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook out or they will kill you, Dm\xc3\xadtri Andr\xc3\xa9ich,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d\nbetter go away\xe2\x80\x94you have no business here.\xe2\x80\x9d But Ol\xc3\xa9nin wanted absolutely\nto see the _abreks_.\n\nFrom behind the mound he saw caps and muskets some two hundred paces\noff. Suddenly a little cloud of smoke appeared from thence, and again a\nbullet whistled past. The _abreks_ were hiding in a marsh at the foot\nof the hill. Ol\xc3\xa9nin was much impressed by the place in which they sat.\nIn reality it was very much like the rest of the steppe, but because\nthe _abreks_ sat there it seemed to detach itself from all the rest and\nto have become distinguished. Indeed it appeared to Ol\xc3\xa9nin that it was\nthe very spot for _abreks_ to occupy. Luk\xc3\xa1shka went back to his horse\nand Ol\xc3\xa9nin followed him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must get a hay-cart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luk\xc3\xa1shka, \xe2\x80\x9cor they will be killing some\nof us. There behind that mound is a Nog\xc3\xa1y cart with a load of hay.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe cornet listened to him and the corporal agreed. The cart of hay was\nfetched, and the Cossacks, hiding behind it, pushed it forward. Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nrode up a hillock from whence he could see everything. The hay-cart\nmoved on and the Cossacks crowded together behind it. The Cossacks\nadvanced, but the Ch\xc3\xa9chens, of whom there were nine, sat with their\nknees in a row and did not fire.\n\nAll was quiet. Suddenly from the Ch\xc3\xa9chens arose the sound of a mournful\nsong, something like Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cAy day, dalalay.\xe2\x80\x9d The Ch\xc3\xa9chens\nknew that they could not escape, and to prevent themselves from being\ntempted to take to flight they had strapped themselves together, knee\nto knee, had got their guns ready, and were singing their death-song.\n\nThe Cossacks with their hay-cart drew closer and closer, and Ol\xc3\xa9nin\nexpected the firing to begin at any moment, but the silence was only\nbroken by the _abreks_\xe2\x80\x99 mournful song. Suddenly the song ceased; there\nwas a sharp report, a bullet struck the front of the cart, and Ch\xc3\xa9chen\ncurses and yells broke the silence and shot followed on shot and one\nbullet after another struck the cart. The Cossacks did not fire and\nwere now only five paces distant.\n\nAnother moment passed and the Cossacks with a whoop rushed out on both\nsides from behind the cart\xe2\x80\x94Luk\xc3\xa1shka in front of them. Ol\xc3\xa9nin heard only\na few shots, then shouting and moans. He thought he saw smoke and\nblood, and abandoning his horse and quite beside himself he ran towards\nthe Cossacks. Horror seemed to blind him. He could not make out\nanything, but understood that all was over. Luk\xc3\xa1shka, pale as death,\nwas holding a wounded Ch\xc3\xa9chen by the arms and shouting, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t kill\nhim. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take him alive!\xe2\x80\x9d The Ch\xc3\xa9chen was the red-haired man who had\nfetched his brother\xe2\x80\x99s body away after Luk\xc3\xa1shka had killed him. Luk\xc3\xa1shka\nwas twisting his arms. Suddenly the Ch\xc3\xa9chen wrenched himself free and\nfired his pistol. Luk\xc3\xa1shka fell, and blood began to flow from his\nstomach. He jumped up, but fell again, swearing in Russian and in\nTartar. More and more blood appeared on his clothes and under him. Some\nCossacks approached him and began loosening his girdle. One of them,\nNaz\xc3\xa1rka, before beginning to help, fumbled for some time, unable to put\nhis sword in its sheath: it would not go the right way. The blade of\nthe sword was blood-stained.\n\nThe Ch\xc3\xa9chens with their red hair and clipped moustaches lay dead and\nhacked about. Only the one we know of, who had fired at Luk\xc3\xa1shka,\nthough wounded in many places was still alive. Like a wounded hawk all\ncovered with blood (blood was flowing from a wound under his right\neye), pale and gloomy, he looked about him with wide-open excited eyes\nand clenched teeth as he crouched, dagger in hand, still prepared to\ndefend himself. The cornet went up to him as if intending to pass by,\nand with a quick movement shot him in the ear. The Ch\xc3\xa9chen started up,\nbut it was too late, and he fell.\n\nThe Cossacks, quite out of breath, dragged the bodies aside and took\nthe weapons from them. Each of the red-haired Ch\xc3\xa9chens had been a man,\nand each one had his own individual expression. Luk\xc3\xa1shka was carried to\nthe cart. He continued to swear in Russian and in Tartar.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo fear, I\xe2\x80\x99ll strangle him with my hands. _Anna seni!_\xe2\x80\x9d he cried,\nstruggling. But he soon became quiet from weakness.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin rode home. In the evening he was told that Luk\xc3\xa1shka was at\ndeath\xe2\x80\x99s door, but that a Tartar from beyond the river had undertaken to\ncure him with herbs.\n\nThe bodies were brought to the village office. The women and the little\nboys hastened to look at them.\n\nIt was growing dark when Ol\xc3\xa9nin returned, and he could not collect\nhimself after what he had seen. But towards night memories of the\nevening before came rushing to his mind. He looked out of the window,\nMary\xc3\xa1nka was passing to and fro from the house to the cowshed, putting\nthings straight. Her mother had gone to the vineyard and her father to\nthe office. Ol\xc3\xa9nin could not wait till she had quite finished her work,\nbut went out to meet her. She was in the hut standing with her back\ntowards him. Ol\xc3\xa9nin thought she felt shy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary\xc3\xa1nka,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI say, Mary\xc3\xa1nka! May I come in?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe suddenly turned. There was a scarcely perceptible trace of tears in\nher eyes and her face was beautiful in its sadness. She looked at him\nin silent dignity.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin again said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary\xc3\xa1nka, I have come\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave me alone!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Her face did not change but the tears ran\ndown her cheeks.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you crying for? What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated in a rough voice. \xe2\x80\x9cCossacks have been killed,\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s what for.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLuk\xc3\xa1shka?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo away! What do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary\xc3\xa1nka!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin, approaching her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will never get anything from me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary\xc3\xa1nka, don\xe2\x80\x99t speak like that,\xe2\x80\x9d Ol\xc3\xa9nin entreated.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet away. I\xe2\x80\x99m sick of you!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the girl, stamping her foot, and\nmoved threateningly towards him. And her face expressed such\nabhorrence, such contempt, and such anger that Ol\xc3\xa9nin suddenly\nunderstood that there was no hope for him, and that his first\nimpression of this woman\xe2\x80\x99s inaccessibility had been perfectly correct.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin said nothing more, but ran out of the hut.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter XLII\n\n\nFor two hours after returning home he lay on his bed motionless. Then\nhe went to his company commander and obtained leave to visit the staff.\nWithout taking leave of anyone, and sending Vany\xc3\xbasha to settle his\naccounts with his landlord, he prepared to leave for the fort where his\nregiment was stationed. Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka was the only one to see him off.\nThey had a drink, and then a second, and then yet another. Again as on\nthe night of his departure from Moscow, a three-horsed conveyance stood\nwaiting at the door. But Ol\xc3\xa9nin did not confer with himself as he had\ndone then, and did not say to himself that all he had thought and done\nhere was \xe2\x80\x9cnot it\xe2\x80\x9d. He did not promise himself a new life. He loved\nMary\xc3\xa1nka more than ever, and knew that he could never be loved by her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-bye, my lad!\xe2\x80\x9d said Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you go on an\nexpedition, be wise and listen to my words\xe2\x80\x94the words of an old man.\nWhen you are out on a raid or the like (you know I\xe2\x80\x99m an old wolf and\nhave seen things), and when they begin firing, don\xe2\x80\x99t get into a crowd\nwhere there are many men. When you fellows get frightened you always\ntry to get close together with a lot of others. You think it is merrier\nto be with others, but that\xe2\x80\x99s where it is worst of all! They always aim\nat a crowd. Now I used to keep farther away from the others and went\nalone, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been wounded. Yet what things haven\xe2\x80\x99t I seen in\nmy day?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a bullet in your back,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Vany\xc3\xbasha, who was\nclearing up the room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was the Cossacks fooling about,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Er\xc3\xb3shka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCossacks? How was that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, just so. We were drinking. V\xc3\xa1nka S\xc3\xadtkin, one of the Cossacks, got\nmerry, and puff! he gave me one from his pistol just here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and did it hurt?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin. \xe2\x80\x9cVany\xc3\xbasha, will you soon be\nready?\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, where\xe2\x80\x99s the hurry! Let me tell you. When he banged into me, the\nbullet did not break the bone but remained here. And I say: \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ve\nkilled me, brother. Eh! What have you done to me? I won\xe2\x80\x99t let you off!\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to stand me a pailful!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but did it hurt?\xe2\x80\x9d Ol\xc3\xa9nin asked again, scarcely listening to the\ntale.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me finish. He stood a pailful, and we drank it, but the blood went\non flowing. The whole room was drenched and covered with blood. Grandad\nBurl\xc3\xa1k, he says, \xe2\x80\x98The lad will give up the ghost. Stand a bottle of the\nsweet sort, or we shall have you taken up!\xe2\x80\x99 They bought more drink, and\nboozed and boozed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but did it hurt you much?\xe2\x80\x9d Ol\xc3\xa9nin asked once more.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurt, indeed! Don\xe2\x80\x99t interrupt: I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it. Let me finish. We\nboozed and boozed till morning, and I fell asleep on the top of the\noven, drunk. When I woke in the morning I could not unbend myself\nanyhow\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it very painful?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Ol\xc3\xa9nin, thinking that now he would at\nlast get an answer to his question.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I tell you it was painful? I did not say it was painful, but I\ncould not bend and could not walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then it healed up?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin, not even laughing, so heavy was\nhis heart.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt healed up, but the bullet is still there. Just feel it!\xe2\x80\x9d And\nlifting his shirt he showed his powerful back, where just near the bone\na bullet could be felt and rolled about.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFeel how it rolls,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, evidently amusing himself with the bullet\nas with a toy. \xe2\x80\x9cThere now, it has rolled to the back.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Luk\xc3\xa1shka, will he recover?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven only knows! There\xe2\x80\x99s no doctor. They\xe2\x80\x99ve gone for one.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere will they get one? From Gr\xc3\xb3znoe?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ol\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my lad. Were I the Tsar I\xe2\x80\x99d have hung all your Russian doctors\nlong ago. Cutting is all they know! There\xe2\x80\x99s our Cossack Bakl\xc3\xa1shka, no\nlonger a real man now that they\xe2\x80\x99ve cut off his leg! That shows they\xe2\x80\x99re\nfools. What\xe2\x80\x99s Bakl\xc3\xa1shka good for now? No, my lad, in the mountains\nthere are real doctors. There was my chum, V\xc3\xb3rchik, he was on an\nexpedition and was wounded just here in the chest. Well, your doctors\ngave him up, but one of theirs came from the mountains and cured him!\nThey understand herbs, my lad!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, stop talking rubbish,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d better send a doctor\nfrom head-quarters.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRubbish!\xe2\x80\x9d the old man said mockingly. \xe2\x80\x9cFool, fool! Rubbish. You\xe2\x80\x99ll\nsend a doctor!\xe2\x80\x94If yours cured people, Cossacks and Ch\xc3\xa9chens would go to\nyou for treatment, but as it is your officers and colonels send to the\nmountains for doctors. Yours are all humbugs, all humbugs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin did not answer. He agreed only too fully that all was humbug in\nthe world in which he had lived and to which he was now returning.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is Luk\xc3\xa1shka? You\xe2\x80\x99ve been to see him?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe just lies as if he were dead. He does not eat nor drink. Vodka is\nthe only thing his soul accepts. But as long as he drinks vodka it\xe2\x80\x99s\nwell. I\xe2\x80\x99d be sorry to lose the lad. A fine lad\xe2\x80\x94a brave, like me. I too\nlay dying like that once. The old women were already wailing. My head\nwas burning. They had already laid me out under the holy icons. So I\nlay there, and above me on the oven little drummers, no bigger than\nthis, beat the tattoo. I shout at them and they drum all the harder.\xe2\x80\x9d\n(The old man laughed.) \xe2\x80\x9cThe women brought our church elder. They were\ngetting ready to bury me. They said, \xe2\x80\x98He defiled himself with worldly\nunbelievers; he made merry with women; he ruined people; he did not\nfast, and he played the _balal\xc3\xa1yka_. Confess,\xe2\x80\x99 they said. So I began to\nconfess. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve sinned!\xe2\x80\x99 I said. Whatever the priest said, I always\nanswered \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve sinned.\xe2\x80\x99 He began to ask me about the _balal\xc3\xa1yka_.\n\xe2\x80\x98Where is the accursed thing,\xe2\x80\x99 he says. \xe2\x80\x98Show it me and smash it.\xe2\x80\x99 But\nI say, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve not got it.\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99d hidden it myself in a net in the\nouthouse. I knew they could not find it. So they left me. Yet after all\nI recovered. When I went for my _balal\xc3\xa1yka_\xe2\x80\x94What was I saying?\xe2\x80\x9d he\ncontinued. \xe2\x80\x9cListen to me, and keep farther away from the other men or\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll get killed foolishly. I feel for you, truly: you are a drinker\xe2\x80\x94I\nlove you! And fellows like you like riding up the mounds. There was one\nwho lived here who had come from Russia, he always would ride up the\nmounds (he called the mounds so funnily, \xe2\x80\x98hillocks\xe2\x80\x99). Whenever he saw a\nmound, off he\xe2\x80\x99d gallop. Once he galloped off that way and rode to the\ntop quite pleased, but a Ch\xc3\xa9chen fired at him and killed him! Ah, how\nwell they shoot from their gun-rests, those Ch\xc3\xa9chens! Some of them\nshoot even better than I do. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it when a fellow gets killed\nso foolishly! Sometimes I used to look at your soldiers and wonder at\nthem. There\xe2\x80\x99s foolishness for you! They go, the poor fellows, all in a\nclump, and even sew red collars to their coats! How can they help being\nhit! One gets killed, they drag him away and another takes his place!\nWhat foolishness!\xe2\x80\x9d the old man repeated, shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not\nscatter, and go one by one? So you just go like that and they won\xe2\x80\x99t\nnotice you. That\xe2\x80\x99s what you must do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, thank you! Good-bye, Daddy. God willing we may meet again,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nOl\xc3\xa9nin, getting up and moving towards the passage.\n\nThe old man, who was sitting on the floor, did not rise.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that the way one says \xe2\x80\x98Good-bye\xe2\x80\x99? Fool, fool!\xe2\x80\x9d he began. \xe2\x80\x9cOh dear,\nwhat has come to people? We\xe2\x80\x99ve kept company, kept company for well-nigh\na year, and now \xe2\x80\x98Good-bye!\xe2\x80\x99 and off he goes! Why, I love you, and how I\npity you! You are so forlorn, always alone, always alone. You\xe2\x80\x99re\nsomehow so unsociable. At times I can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep for thinking about you. I\nam so sorry for you. As the song has it:\n\nIt is very hard, dear brother,\nIn a foreign land to live.\n\n\nSo it is with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ol\xc3\xa9nin again.\n\nThe old man rose and held out his hand. Ol\xc3\xa9nin pressed it and turned to\ngo.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive us your mug, your mug!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the old man took Ol\xc3\xa9nin by the head with both hands and kissed him\nthree times with wet moustaches and lips, and began to cry.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love you, good-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin got into the cart.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, is that how you\xe2\x80\x99re going? You might give me something for a\nremembrance. Give me a gun! What do you want two for?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old\nman, sobbing quite sincerely.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin got out a musket and gave it to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a lot you\xe2\x80\x99ve given the old fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Vany\xc3\xbasha, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99ll\nnever have enough! A regular old beggar. They are all such irregular\npeople,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, as he wrapped himself in his overcoat and took\nhis seat on the box.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue, swine!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the old man, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a\nstingy fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMary\xc3\xa1nka came out of the cowshed, glanced indifferently at the cart,\nbowed and went towards the hut.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_La fille!_\xe2\x80\x9d said Vany\xc3\xbasha, with a wink, and burst out into a silly\nlaugh.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrive on!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Ol\xc3\xa9nin, angrily.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, my lad! Good-bye. I won\xe2\x80\x99t forget you!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Er\xc3\xb3shka.\n\nOl\xc3\xa9nin turned round. Daddy Er\xc3\xb3shka was talking to Mary\xc3\xa1nka, evidently\nabout his own affairs, and neither the old man nor the girl looked at\nOl\xc3\xa9nin.\n\n\n\n'
